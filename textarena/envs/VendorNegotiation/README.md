# VendorNegotiation Environment

## Overview
**VendorNegotiation** is a two-player negotiation game where a Brand Specialist negotiates with a Vendor over discount rates for products in an upcoming sales event. Both players can win by achieving their respective objectives through cooperative-competitive dynamics.

## Action Space
- **Format:** Actions are strings with optional conversation before bracketed commands:
  - `[Propose] X%, Y%, Z%, ...` - Propose discount rates (positional format)
  - `[Accept]` - Accept current proposal
  - `[Reject]` - Reject current proposal
  - Free text conversation (no brackets)
- **Example:**
  - `"I think moderate discounts work well [Propose] 20%, 15%, 20%, 20%, 15%"`
  - `"This looks reasonable to me [Accept]"`
  - `"Hello, let's discuss the discount rates"`
