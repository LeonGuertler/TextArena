OBJECTIVE:
Earn the most points possible over 10 rounds by choosing X or Y strategically.

SCORING RUBRIC (per round):
- 1 X and 3 Y's: X wins 3 points, Y's lose 1 point each
- 2 X's and 2 Y's: X's win 2 points each, Y's lose 2 points each  
- 3 X's and 1 Y: X's win 1 point each, Y loses 3 points
- 4 X's: All X's lose 1 point each
- 4 Y's: All Y's win 1 point each

ROUND STRUCTURE:
- Rounds 1-4, 6-7, 9: Act phase only (1x points)
- Round 5: Talk phase -> Act phase (3x points)
- Round 8: Talk phase -> Act phase (5x points)  
- Round 10: Talk phase -> Act phase (10x points)

TALK PHASE RULES:
- Maximum 40 conversation rounds (10 per player)
- Public messages: [Broadcast] your message (everyone sees sender and content)
- Private messages: [Whisper to X] your message (only sender and receiver know content, others see "A private message was sent")
- End participation: [Pass]
- Phase ends when max rounds reached OR all players pass

ACT PHASE RULES:
- Choose your action: [Choose X] or [Choose Y]
- All players choose simultaneously
- Round scored when all choices collected
