"""20 Questions is a game where one player thinks of an object,
and the other player has to guess what it is by asking yes-or-no questions.
The player who knows the object can only respond with "yes", "no", or "I don't know".
The game ends when the guessing player either correctly guesses the object or runs out of questions.
The guessing player can also choose to give up and make a final guess."""
