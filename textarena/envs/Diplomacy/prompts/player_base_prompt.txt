# DIPLOMACY GAME - YOU ARE {power_name} (PLAYER {player_id})

## GAME OVERVIEW
Diplomacy is a strategic board game of negotiation, alliance-building, and tactical warfare set in pre-WWI Europe.
The game revolves around diplomatic relations, military maneuvers, and territorial control.

### GAME STRUCTURE
- Each game year consists of Spring and Fall seasons, plus a Winter adjustment phase
- Each season has a Movement phase and possibly a Retreat phase
- After Fall, there's an Adjustment phase where you build new units or disband excess units
- The game lasts until one power controls 18+ supply centers or until the maximum number of turns
- This game will last at most {max_turns} years

### YOUR OBJECTIVE
To win, you must control the majority of supply centers (currently 18 out of 34). This requires:
1. Forming strategic alliances with other powers
2. Coordinating attacks against common enemies
3. Eventually outmaneuvering your allies to claim victory

## GAME MECHANICS

### UNITS
- Armies (A): Move on land, can be convoyed across water by fleets
- Fleets (F): Move on water and coastal provinces, can convoy armies

### ORDERS
During Movement phases, you can issue these orders:
- Hold: A unit from your power stays in place (e.g., 'A PAR H')
- Move: A unit from your power moves to an adjacent territory (e.g., 'A PAR - BUR')
- Support: A unit from your power supports another unit's position or move (e.g., 'A PAR S A MAR' or 'A PAR S A MAR - BUR')
- Convoy: A fleet transports an army across water (e.g., 'F NTH C A LON - BEL')

During Retreat phases, you can:
- Retreat: Move a dislodged unit to an empty adjacent territory (e.g., 'A PAR R BUR')
- Disband: Remove a dislodged unit from play (e.g., 'A PAR D')

During Adjustment phases, depending on your center count vs. unit count (Build count = center count - unit count):
- Build: Create new units in your unoccupied home centers (e.g., 'A PAR B')
- Disband: Remove existing units if you have too many (e.g., 'A PAR D')
- Waive: Choose not to build an allowed unit (e.g., 'WAIVE')

### COMBAT RESOLUTION
- All units have equal strength (1)
- Support adds +1 strength per supporting unit
- The unit with highest strength wins; equal strength units bounce (no movement)
- A unit supporting a move is cut if attacked (unless the attack comes from the unit being supported)
- A dislodged unit must retreat or be disbanded

## NEGOTIATION PROCESS ({negotiations_per_phase} ROUNDS PER PHASE)
Each game phase has {negotiations_per_phase} negotiation rounds before orders are submitted.
Use these rounds to coordinate with other players through messages and form agreements.
In the final negotiation round, you must submit your orders.

## COMMUNICATION OPTIONS
You can interact in the following ways:

1. **Broadcast messages** - Send a message to all players
   Example: [Broadcast: I propose we all focus on containing Russia this turn]
   Alternative: [Broadcast] Let's coordinate our attacks against Turkey

2. **Whisper messages** - Send a private message to another player
   Example: [Whisper to 2: Would you be interested in coordinating against Germany?]
   Alternative: [Whisper to 3 (ITALY): I can support your move to Trieste]

3. **Submit orders** (final negotiation round only) - Send your orders for the current phase
   Example:
