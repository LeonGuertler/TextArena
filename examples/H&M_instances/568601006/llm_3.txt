Historical baseline samples [306,375,413,482,429] are much lower than this recent regime \u2192 treat as sustained higher demand. c) Lead time / missing orders: Concluded history shows supplier actual lead_time = 1 for delivered shipments (periods 2\u201314). The only flagged delays from earlier periods have been resolved in later concludes; the current in-transit=600 corresponds to the Period 14 order (expected to arrive during Period 15 resolution). No evidence yet of additional losses. d) Inventory & pipeline: on-hand=0; in-transit=600 (arrives during this period's resolution but you won't see it until Period 16 conclude). With L=1 we must plan to cover (L+1)=2 periods of demand. Using recent regime, conservatively forecast ~900 units per period (900\u2013950 suggested by P13\u2013P14). Two-period demand \u22481,800. Current pipeline covers 600 \u2192 shortfall \u22481,200. e) Final order logic: order enough to cover two periods at the elevated demand regime while accepting holding cost tradeoff.
