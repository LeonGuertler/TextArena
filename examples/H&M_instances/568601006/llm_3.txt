Infer LT=1 and no lost orders in history. d) Inventory & pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=300 (order placed in Period15).

Lead time & arrivals: History shows consistent supplier lead time = 1 (multiple concluded periods with ordered->arrived after 1 period). Current pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=333 (this was ordered in Period 16 and WILL arrive after decision but before demand). Thus available for Period 17 demand = 333 units. Decision timing: any order placed now (Period 17) will arrive in Period 18 and cannot satisfy Period 17 demand. Inventory assessment: expected stock for Period 17 demand = 333 -> will be stockout vs. forecast \u2248626 (short \u2248293). Ordering logic: balance profit ($2/unit sold) vs holding cost ($1/unit/period). Forecast next-period demand \u2248626; to target average demand while avoiding excess holding cost, place an order to roughly meet expected Period 18 demand (i.e., ~626).
