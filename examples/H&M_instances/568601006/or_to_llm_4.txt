============================================================
{
  "rationale": "Date 2019-12-23. Concluded history shows supplier actual lead time = 1 period (arrivals consistently one period after order) and there is a recent high-demand regime (periods 13\u201320 single-period demand mostly in the 500\u2013900 range; recent four-period average \u2248 650). On-hand=0, in-transit=993 (this will arrive this period but is only visible next period). OR's recommendation (31) uses long-run historical mean and promised lead time and is far too small given current demand. With L=1 we should cover ~2 periods of likely demand: 2\xd7650 \u2248 1300 units. Pipeline provides 993 \u2192 shortfall \u2248 307. Ordering 307 balances service (avoid large lost sales at $2 profit/unit) vs holding cost ($1/unit/period).",
