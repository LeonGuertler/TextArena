Using initial samples from train.csv: /Users/tianyipeng/Documents/Operations_Research_Code/25-11-supply-chain-agent/OR_Agent/examples/H&M_instances/568601006/train.csv
  Samples: [306, 375, 413, 482, 429]
  Mean: 401.0, Count: 5
Promised lead time (used by OR, shown to LLM): 1 periods (1 period = 14 days)
Note: OR uses promised lead time for recommendations. Actual lead times in CSV may differ.
      LLM must infer actual lead time from arrivals and adjust OR recommendations accordingly.

{
  "rationale": "Date 2019-03-18 (start of spring season) \u2014 no news indicating a demand shift. Historical sample mean demand \u2248401 units/period (samples: 306,375,413,482,429). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so pipeline_inventory=0. OR capped recommendation = 509. OR's base_stock implicitly accounts for service level from profit/(profit+holding)=2/3; its cap limits extreme orders. Given no evidence of lead-time drift or lost shipments and seasonality (spring) that doesn't contradict historical demand, I accept the OR recommendation. Ordering 509 balances the desire to meet expected demand (~401) plus safety stock to cover variability while following the OR's capped risk tradeoff (minimizes stockouts vs holding cost).",
