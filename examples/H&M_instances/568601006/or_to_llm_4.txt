{
  "rationale": "Date 2019-12-09 (Period 20). Recent realized lead time = 1 period (multiple concluded arrivals matching orders one period earlier). Recent demand regime elevated: periods 11\u201319 demands = [447,482,685,953,596,595,616,523,902], mean \u2248644 units and high variance. On-hand=0, in-transit=0, so no pipeline stock will cover next-period demand. OR baseline recommends 779 units (uses historical mean and promised LT); I treat that as a sensible starting point but slightly reduce to limit holding cost given high variance and non-negligible holding=$1/unit/period. With LT=1 an order now will arrive for Period 21 demand; targeting expected demand \u2248644 plus a modest safety buffer (to balance Profit=$2 vs Holding=$1) leads me to order 700 units \u2014 near OR's suggestion but restrained to reduce excess end-period inventory risk.",

OR recommends 324 based on historical demand and promised LT. Given the strong evidence LT=1 and a large incoming shipment (700) that likely covers expected demand (~644) for the upcoming period, ordering more now would create unnecessary holding cost ($1/unit/period) while giving only $2 profit per additional unit sold.
