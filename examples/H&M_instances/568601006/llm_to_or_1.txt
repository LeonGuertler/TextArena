Period 1 (2019-03-18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019-03-18). No news/seasonality indicated. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so there are no arrivals expected from history. Historical demand samples = [306,375,413,482,429], mean=401.0, std\u224858.647. Promised lead time=1; no observed concluded periods to contradict it. Use defaults: L=promised (1) so review+lead window = 2 periods. mu_hat = (1+L)*mean = 802.0 to cover expected demand over review+lead. sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std \u2248 82.93 to reflect demand variability over the longer window. These parameters let the OR backend compute a base-stock matching the cost ratio (profit $2 vs holding $1) while the larger mu_hat accounts for the two-period exposure and sigma_hat increases safety for variability; conservative given zero on-hand/pipeline.
