Period 1 (2019-03-18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019-03-18). No on-hand or in-transit inventory and no concluded arrivals history to suggest LT deviations. Historical demand samples = [306,375,413,482,429], mean=401.0, std\u224858.65. Use promised lead time (1) and default aggregation: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean = 2*401 = 802.0 to cover review+lead demand; sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std = sqrt(2)*58.65 \u2248 83.0 to reflect demand variability over the review+lead window. These settings give the OR backend a base-stock tuned to current demand evidence while not inflating safety stock without arrival/lead-time signals.

Period 2 (2019-04-01) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 2). Historical demand samples = [306,375,413,482,429], mean=401.0. One outstanding order (509) placed earlier did NOT arrive in Period 1 (arrived=0); this flags a potential delay or loss but provides no observed concluded lead time, so do not change promised LT. Use promised lead time L=1. Set mu_hat using default (1+L)*mean = 2*401 = 802 to cover review+lead demand. Set sigma_hat using default sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples) where sample std \u2248 65.56 \u2192 sigma_hat \u2248 92.72. These parameters keep the OR engine on the standard base-stock tuned to recent mean demand while the elevated sigma reflects observed variability; retaining L=1 avoids overreacting to a single missed arrival while the carry-over insight notes the missing shipment for monitoring.

Carry-over insight: Outstanding order of 509 placed prior to Period 1 did not arrive in Period 1 (Period 1 conclude: ordered=509, arrived=0) \u2014 possible delayed or lost shipment; monitor future concludes to confirm lead-time regime.

Period 3 (2019-04-15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15 (Period 3). History shows one observed arrival with lead time=1 (Period1 order arrived in Period2). Current inventory: on-hand=82, in-transit=329 (pipeline total=411). Promised LT=1 and the historical arrival confirms a 1-period regime; use default lead time. Demand history mean=401.0 (n=5) and std\u224858.64. Set mu_hat = (1+L)*mean = 802.0 to cover review+lead demand. Set sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std = 82.96 to reflect observed volatility. These parameters keep base-stock tied to recent average demand while the sigma preserves service-level buffer given occasional late arrival observed but resolved in Period2.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime confirmed at 1 period (Period1 order arrived in Period2: ordered=509 arrived=509).

Period 4 (2019-04-29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 decision (2019-04-29): observed arrivals in concluded periods show a stable 1-period actual lead time (Period1\u21922, Period2\u21923). Use promised/observed LT=1. Demand history (all samples [306,375,413,482,429], mean=401.0, sample std\u224865.56) shows no recent regime shift; apply default formulas: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean = 2*401 = 802.0 units (covers review+lead), sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std = sqrt(2)*65.56 \u2248 92.75. These inputs keep the OR engine's base-stock around the empirical demand over the review+lead window while reflecting measured variability; using defaults avoids overreacting to the earlier one-time missing arrival which has since been resolved.

Period 5 (2019-05-13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Promised LT=1 is confirmed by concluded arrivals (Period2: P1 order arrived with LT=1; Period3/4 arrivals also show LT=1). No clear demand regime shift vs. supplied historical samples. Use default (1+L) scaling on full-sample stats: mean of samples = 401.0, so mu_hat = 2 * 401.0 = 802.0. Sample std of demand \u2248 65.56; sigma_hat = sqrt(2) * 65.56 \u2248 92.74. These settings keep the OR engine's base-stock tied to observed demand while accounting for one-period lead time and observed volatility.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime confirmed at 1 period (evidence: Period2 conclude: ordered on P1 arrived in P2 = 509; subsequent concluded periods show 1-period arrivals).

Period 6 (2019-05-27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-05-27): on-hand=127, in-transit=341. Historical concluded arrivals show a consistent 1-period lead time (orders from P1\u2192arrived P2, P2\u2192P3, P3\u2192P4, P4\u2192P5). Demand history (concluded periods 1\u20135) = [401,427,257,351,339], mean=355.0, std (sample)=65.54. I use promised/default lead time L=1 (confirmed by history). Use default mu_hat = (1+L)*mean = 2*355 = 710 to cover review+lead demand. Use default sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std = sqrt(2)*65.54 = 92.75 to reflect observed variability. These settings keep the OR backend's base-stock and cap consistent with the confirmed LT=1 regime and the recent demand variability, balancing service vs holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

Period 7 (2019-06-10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent concluded periods consistently show 1-period arrivals (orders placed arrive next conclude); therefore use promised lead time L=1. Use historical demand samples provided (mean=401 over five samples) with default aggregation: mu_hat=(1+L)*mean = 2*401 = 802. sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(samples) = sqrt(2)*58.49 = 82.74. On-hand=182 and in-transit=329 are healthy but policy will target base-stock derived from these demand moments to balance $2 profit vs $1 holding cost (q=2/(2+1)=0.666.. -> moderate service level).

Period 8 (2019-06-24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24 (Period 8). History shows consistent 1-period arrivals in concluded periods (orders placed in Pn arrive in Pn+1), so keep L=1 (promised lead time confirmed). On-hand=250, in-transit=271 (pipeline). I use default statistical choices: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all past demands) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all past demands). Using concluded demands [401,427,257,351,339,286,261] => mean=331.7142857; sample std\u224867.046. With L=1: mu_hat=663.4285714, sigma_hat\u224894.778 (sqrt2\xd767.046). These settings keep the OR engine's base-stock tied to recent realized demand while the elevated sigma increases safety stock to protect against observed variability and occasional delayed arrivals.

Period 9 (2019-07-08) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period=2019-07-08. On-hand=332, in-transit=245. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show 1-period lead time (Periods 2\u20138); no new missed arrivals to contradict. I use promised/default L=1. Demand history (periods 1\u20138) mean=313.875; with (1+L)=2 this gives mu_hat=627.75. Sample std of demands\u224879.9937; scaled by sqrt(1+L)=\u221a2 \u2192 sigma_hat\u2248113.137. These default choices keep the OR engine's base-stock tied to observed demand over review+lead, while sigma reflects observed volatility so the capped policy limits order size and balances service vs. holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

Daily Reward (R_t): $143.00

Period 10 (2019-07-22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent concluded periods show a sustained downward shift in demand starting around Period 4. I set lead time to the observed regime (1). For demand I use a recent-N estimate (most recent regime: Periods 4\u20139, 6 samples) to capture the lower mean/variance. This raises responsiveness and keeps base_stock tuned to the lower recent demand while sigma increases safety for variability. Calculations: recent demand samples = [351,339,286,261,189,240], mean=277.667, std\u224861.27; with L=1 => mu_hat=(1+L)*mean=555.333, sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std\u224886.66.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift down starting Period 4; recent-period mean\u2248277.7 (Periods 4\u20139, n=6) and increased relative volatility. Lead time confirmed at 1 period (observed arrivals consistently 1).

Period 11 (2019-08-05) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Lead time: concluded arrivals across periods consistently show 1-period lead time (initial anomaly resolved); set L=1. Demand: evidence of downward regime starting Period 4 \u2014 recent demands (Periods 4\u201310) = [351,339,286,261,189,240,157], mean=260.43 and elevated volatility. Use recent_N=7 to capture the new regime. mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_recent = 2*260.4286 = 520.8571. sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std_recent; std_recent \u224872.873 -> sigma_hat \u2248103.06. These raise base stock to reflect lower recent mean while keeping higher safety stock for observed volatility; L=1 keeps timing aligned with concluded arrivals.

Period 12 (2019-08-19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Lead time remains the promised 1 period (history shows consistent 1-period arrivals in concluded periods). Demand shifted down starting Period 4; I use the most recent regime (Periods 4\u201311, n=8) to estimate demand. Set L=1 (default). Use recent_N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the lower, more volatile recent demand: mean demand over those 8 periods = 283.75, so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean = 567.50. Sample std of those 8 = 87.84; sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std = 124.24. These parameters raise base-stock to cover two-period exposure while capturing recent lower mean and elevated volatility, balancing service against holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1 (q=0.666...).

Period 13 (2019-09-02) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 13). Lead time has been consistently observed as 1 period across concluded history (arrivals from orders placed in prior period). Recent demand shows a regime with higher variability: Periods 4\u201312 demands = [351,339,286,261,189,240,157,447,482], mean=305.78 and elevated std. I set L=1 (explicit) to reflect the confirmed 1-period regime. I use recent_N for demand parameters using the most recent 9 concluded periods (Periods 4\u201312) because the demand pattern shifted starting Period 4 and the last 9 periods capture the new mean and the recent high spikes (Periods 11\u201312) that increase required safety stock. mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_recent = 2 * 305.78 = 611.56 to cover review+lead demand. sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std_recent = sqrt(2) * 108.66 = 153.67 to reflect elevated volatility and thereby raise the base-stock safety buffer. These settings push the OR backend to hold higher inventory to avoid lost sales given the recent high spikes, while using the confirmed LT=1 to avoid overestimating lead time.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed at 1 period (observed consistently in concluded periods); demand regime shifted starting Period 4 with increased volatility \u2014 recent 9-period mean=305.78, std=108.66.

Period 14 (2019-09-16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Lead time confirmed at 1 period from concluded history (consistent 1-period arrivals through Period 13). Demand regime shifted down/increased volatility beginning Period 4; use recent regime stats to avoid bias from older higher-demand periods. I set L to promised (1). For demand I use recent_N=9 (Periods 5\u201313 as identified in carry-over) with mean=305.78 and std=108.66 -> mu_hat=(1+L)*mean=611.56, sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std=153.72. These parameters raise base-stock to cover the higher observed volatility while keeping cap constraint in OR backend to limit overly large orders.

Period 15 (2019-09-30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-30 (Period 15). Lead time: concluded history shows consistent 1-period arrivals in concluded periods (Periods 2\u201314), so use promised LT=1. Demand regime: recent periods show a downward-shifted, higher-volatility regime starting around Period 4; carry-over analysis reports recent 9-period mean=305.78 and std=108.66 (use these to reflect current demand & variability). Therefore set L=1 (default promised), mu_hat = (1+L)*recent_mean = 2*305.78 = 611.56 to cover review+lead demand, and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*recent_std = sqrt(2)*108.66 = 153.78 to capture increased volatility. These parameters keep the OR backend's base-stock tied to the observed lower mean but elevated variance, balancing service vs holding costs given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

Period 16 (2019-10-14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-10-14). On-hand=0, in-transit=434. Historic concluded periods consistently show 1-period lead time; no new missed-arrival evidence. Demand regime has been lower with higher volatility since Period 4; recent 9-period stats remain representative (recent 9-period mean=305.78, std=108.66). I set L=1 (confirmed), use recent_N=9 to capture the post-changepoint demand mean for mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_recent, and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std_recent to reflect aggregated review+lead variability. These parameters raise base stock to cover two-period demand under the current, more volatile regime while the capped order will limit extreme orders.

Period 17 (2019-10-28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Lead time confirmed at 1 period by concluded arrivals in history; use L=1. Recent demand regime (shift from Period 4) persists \u2014 use recent_N=9 to capture current lower mean and higher volatility (carry-over analysis: recent 9-period mean=305.78, std=108.66).

Period 18 (2019-11-11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 18). On-hand=3, in-transit=505. Historical concluded arrivals show a stable 1-period lead time since Period 2; carry-over analysis indicates a demand regime shift starting Period 4 with elevated volatility (recent 9-period mean=305.78, std=108.66). I set L to the promised/confirmed 1. For demand I use recent_N=9 to capture the post-changepoint regime (N from carry-over evidence). mu_hat = (1+L)*recent_mean to size stock for the review+lead period under the new regime. sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*recent_std to reflect elevated variability; these parameters raise safety stock moderately to protect service given profit/holding tradeoff (profit=$2, holding=$1 gives q=0.666..., handled by OR engine).

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed at 1 period (consistent arrivals in concluded periods); demand regime shifted starting Period 4 \u2014 recent 9-period mean=305.78, std=108.66.

Period 19 (2019-11-25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 19). Lead time has been consistently observed as 1 period in concluded history (multiple periods, most recently Periods 12\u201318). Demand regime shifted down starting Period 4; recent sample (most recent 9 concluded demands) shows mean\u2248305.78 and std\u2248108.66. On-hand=0, in-transit=697 (recent order placed in P18 will arrive under L=1). I set L=promised (1) because concluded arrivals are consistently 1. I use recent_N=9 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-changepoint demand regime (N=9 matches the documented recent window). mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_recent to cover review+lead period; sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std_recent to reflect aggregated volatility. These parameters increase safety relative to using older higher-demand samples while keeping service given current pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed at 1 period (consistent arrivals across concluded periods 2\u201318); demand regime shifted down starting Period 4 \u2014 recent 9-period mean=305.78, std=108.66 (use recent window for forecasting).

Period 20 (2019-12-09) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-12-09. Lead time has been consistently 1 period in concluded history; on-hand=0, in-transit=556 (expected arrivals placed earlier). Recent demand regime (Periods 11\u201319) shows elevated mean and volatility; carry-over evidence indicates recent 9-period mean=305.78, std=108.66. I keep L at the promised/confirmed 1 period. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the recent 9-period window to capture the downshifted but volatile demand: mu_hat=(1+L)*mean=2*305.78=611.56; sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std = sqrt(2)*108.66=153.67. These parameters raise the base-stock to meet higher recent demand while the OR backend cap will limit extreme orders; using recent stats balances service level vs holding cost given confirmed LT=1 and current pipeline of 556.

Lead time kept at 1 (promised and repeatedly confirmed in concluded periods).

Scale for review+lead (1+L=2) to produce mu_hat and scale volatility by sqrt(1+L). These parameters reflect confirmed LT=1 and the lower, higher-volatility demand regime to balance service vs holding cost.
