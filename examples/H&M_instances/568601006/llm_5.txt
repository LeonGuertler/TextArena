Use this as best forecast for next period. c) Lead time / arrivals: Concluded history consistently confirms supplier lead time = 1 period (multiple concluded arrivals). The in-transit 108 (ordered in Period14) will arrive in Period16 (after this decision). Do NOT assume any other unseen arrivals. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand = 0, in-transit = 108 arriving next period. To meet expected demand (~642) in Period16, net required arriving inventory = ~642 - 108 = 534. e) Final order logic: Place an order to bring incoming inventory roughly to expected demand; avoid excess due to high holding cost ($1/unit vs $2/unit profit). Order 540 units (covers expected demand with a small buffer for variability).",
