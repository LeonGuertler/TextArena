{
  "rationale": "a) Date/news: Period 1 is 2019-03-18 (spring season \u2014 blazers reasonable demand in spring). b) Demand regime: historical unified samples for SKU 568601006 = [306,375,413,482,429], mean \u2248 401 units/period; no evidence of regime change. c) Lead time: supplier promised LT=1 but no concluded periods exist yet to confirm or detect delays, so treat LT as 1 for ordering (but unconfirmed). d) Inventory & pipeline: on-hand 0, in-transit 0, so no arrivals will satisfy current period demand; demand this period will likely stockout but we cannot retroactively supply it. e) Final order logic: place order now to meet expected demand in the next period (when this order will arrive). Use the historical mean (~400) as the forecast; avoid excess given holding cost = $1/unit/period vs profit = $2/unit. Order 400 units.",
