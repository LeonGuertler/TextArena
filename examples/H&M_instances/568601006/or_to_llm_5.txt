No concluded periods exist to infer actual lead time, so assume promised LT=1 but treat it as uncertain. OR recommendation: 509 units (capped policy). Interpretation: OR is ordering well above the sample mean (likely adding safety for pipeline and LT). I prefer a more conservative order because holding cost is high ($1/unit/period) relative to profit ($2), and starting inventory is zero so immediate service can be met with a near-mean order plus modest safety. Action: order close to the estimated base_stock (\u03bc\u0302 + z*\u03c3\u0302 \u2248 426) rather than the larger capped value to balance service and holding cost.

{
  "rationale": "Date 2019-12-09 (Period 20). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Lead time = 1 period (confirmed repeatedly in history). Recent demand has been strongly elevated: Periods 11\u201319 demands = [447,482,685,953,596,595,616,523,902], mean \u2248644, so near-term demand likely 600\u2013700 units per period. OR recommends 779 units (starts from its base-stock/cap rule). Given LT=1 and that my order will arrive for Period 21 demand (can't satisfy Period 20 now), I treat OR as a reasonable high-service target but trim slightly to reduce expected ending inventory and holding cost while still capturing most sales. Final order 750 balances service (covers typical demand ~600\u2013700) vs holding cost.",

Period 21 (2019-12-23) Hybrid Decision:
============================================================
{
  "rationale": "Date/context: Period 21 (2019-12-23), holiday season but recent realized demand has been very high (Periods 11\u201320: 447,482,685,953,596,595,523,902,562 \u2014 recent mean \u2248600+). Lead-time evidence: multiple concluded periods confirm LT=1 (arrivals consistently 1 period after order). Inventory picture: on-hand=0, in-transit=750 (this is the Period20 order; with LT=1 we should expect it to arrive after ordering but before demand). OR recommended 274 (baseline using promised LT and historical demand). Interpretation & adjustment: given strong evidence LT=1 and a large pipeline shipment (750) that will almost surely arrive in this period, ordering additional units now would raise holding cost without materially improving service (expected demand ~600 vs incoming 750). Therefore I override the OR recommendation and order 0 to avoid excess holding cost while maintaining service from the imminent receipt.",
