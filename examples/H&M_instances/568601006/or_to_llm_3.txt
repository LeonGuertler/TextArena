Using initial samples from train.csv: /Users/tianyipeng/Documents/Operations_Research_Code/25-11-supply-chain-agent/OR_Agent/examples/H&M_instances/568601006/train.csv
  Samples: [306, 375, 413, 482, 429]
  Mean: 401.0, Count: 5
Promised lead time (used by OR, shown to LLM): 1 periods (1 period = 14 days)
Note: OR uses promised lead time for recommendations. Actual lead times in CSV may differ.
      LLM must infer actual lead time from arrivals and adjust OR recommendations accordingly.

{
  "rationale": "Date/news: 2019-03-18 (start of spring season for womens blazers) \u2014 no disruptive news. Demand evidence: historical sample mean = 401 units/period, sample SD \u2248 59. OR recommendation = 509. I computed base_stock = \u03bc\u0302 + z*\xb7\u03c3\u0302 where z*=\u03a6\u22121(2/3)\u22480.43 \u2192 401 + 0.43\xb759 \u2248 426. OR's higher 509 likely uses a larger \u03c3 or different divisor; with zero on-hand/in-transit and promised LT=1, we must balance sales vs high holding cost ($1/unit vs $2 profit). Adjustment from OR: scale OR down to the analytically consistent base_stock (426) to reduce expected holding costs while preserving most service-level upside. Final qty provides expected coverage \u2248 mean demand plus modest safety stock given holding penalty. ",
