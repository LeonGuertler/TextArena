Reality: Period 1 concluded showing the order of 430 did NOT arrive (ordered=430, arrived=0) and current in-transit=430.

Ordering more now risks extra holding cost ($1/unit/period) with only $2 margin.

History shows supplier lead time = 1 period (consistent arrivals in concluded periods) and a sustained higher demand regime since ~Period 11 (recent demands: 447,482,685,953,596,595,616,523,902 \u2192 recent mean \u2248 ~620). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so any order with LT=1 will arrive before this period's demand. OR recommends 779 (base-stock capped using historical \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302). Given confirmed LT=1, elevated recent demand, and high cost of stockouts (profit=$2 vs holding=$1 favors service), I follow the OR recommendation to prioritize sales and avoid lost demand. Ordering 779 balances the higher demand regime with holding cost via the OR cap.",

Period 21 (2019-12-23) Hybrid Decision:
============================================================
{
  "rationale": "Date 2019-12-23 (holiday season). History shows supplier lead time = 1 (arrivals consistently match prior-period orders). Demand regime increased starting ~Period 11; recent periods show very high demand (Periods 11\u201317 mean \u2248624.9, Periods 18\u201320 also high). OR recommends 245 units based on promised LT and past demand, but current pipeline = 779 units (will arrive after ordering and before demand). Ordering now would only increase holding cost ($1/unit) while we already have >1 period of expected demand inbound. To balance service vs holding cost, I override OR and order 0 units this period; inbound 779 should cover high demand near-term without excess holding cost.",
