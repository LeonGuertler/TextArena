No external news; seasonal/context: late summer/early fall \u2014 recent demand spikes observed.\nb) Demand regime: Recent concluded periods 11-14 show very large realized demand (447, 482, 685, 953). Average over P11-14 = 641.75 units/period; these are censored by stockouts in some periods but indicate a sustained upward demand regime starting ~2019-08-05 (Period 11).\nc) Lead time / missing orders: Historical conclusions show consistent supplier lead_time = 1 (evidence: Periods 2,4,6,7,9,11,13,14 arrivals). In-transit = 400 (ordered in Period 14) is expected to arrive for Period 15 demand.\nd) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand = 0 now. Expected available for Period 15 demand = in-transit 400 (arrives before demand). No other deliveries expected. Orders placed in Period 15 will arrive in Period 16.\ne) Final order logic: Period 15 demand is likely to remain high (estimate ~600\u2013900); because the only stock for Period 15 is the arriving 400, place an order now to cover expected Period 16 demand. I choose a balanced order of 900 units to target high recent demand while limiting excess holding cost (profit per sold = $2, holding = $1/unit/period).",
