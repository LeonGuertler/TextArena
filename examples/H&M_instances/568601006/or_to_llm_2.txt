Using initial samples from train.csv: /Users/tianyipeng/Documents/Operations_Research_Code/25-11-supply-chain-agent/OR_Agent/examples/H&M_instances/568601006/train.csv
  Samples: [306, 375, 413, 482, 429]
  Mean: 401.0, Count: 5
Promised lead time (used by OR, shown to LLM): 1 periods (1 period = 14 days)
Note: OR uses promised lead time for recommendations. Actual lead times in CSV may differ.
      LLM must infer actual lead time from arrivals and adjust OR recommendations accordingly.

{
  "rationale": "Date: 2019-03-18. No news signals; SKU is a seasonal apparel item but no calendar event requires deviation. Historical demand mean = 401 units/period, sample std \u2248 66. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Promised LT=1 (no concluded periods to contradict it), so an order placed now will not help Period 1 demand but should cover upcoming periods. OR recommended 509 units (starting point). OR appears to overshoot relative to my basestock calculation: basestock \u2248 \u03bc + z*\u03c3 = 401 + 0.431\xb766 \u2248 429. Given holding cost = $1/unit/period (high relative to profit) I avoid excessive overstock; ordering to the basestock balances service vs holding. Final action 429 units provides one-period mean demand coverage plus a modest safety buffer while reducing holding cost versus OR's 509.",
