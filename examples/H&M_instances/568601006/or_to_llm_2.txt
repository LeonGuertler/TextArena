Demand has been in a sustained high regime since 2019-08-05 (Periods 11\u201319 mean \u2248625 with recent spikes: Period 19 demand=902). OR baseline recommends 779 based on historical averages and promised LT; with on-hand=0 and in-transit=0 an order will arrive next period (given LT=1). I increase OR's recommendation to 900 units to better cover the recent high/volatile demand and the observed peak (902) while accepting modest holding cost risk (Profit $2 > Holding $1 so higher service is justified). This aims to maximize Profit\xd7sales minus Holding\xd7ending_inventory under the current high-demand regime and confirmed LT=1.",

{
  "rationale": "Date 2019-12-23: sustained high-demand regime (recent periods 11\u201319 mean \u2248625) and promised LT=1 (confirmed historically). Current state: on-hand=0, in-transit=900 (this shipment was ordered in Period 20 and will arrive after decisions are applied but before Period 21 demand per sequencing). OR recommends 124 units based on historical mean and promised LT, but it cannot see the large incoming shipment. Ordering now will not affect the imminent arrival of the 900 units (they cover expected Period 21 demand ~550\u2013650) and would create extra holding cost ($1/unit/period) versus modest profit ($2/unit). To maximize R_t = Profit\xd7sold \u2212 Holding\xd7ending_inventory, I avoid adding inventory while a large shipment is en route. Therefore I override OR and order 0 units now to minimize holding cost while relying on the incoming 900 to meet demand.",
