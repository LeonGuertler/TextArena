{
  "rationale": "a) Date/context: Period 1 (2019-03-18) \u2014 early spring; blazer seasonal demand steady for spring. No special holidays. b) Demand regime: Historical unified samples = [306,375,413,482,429], mean = 401 units/14-day period; no evidence of a regime shift. c) Lead time: Supplier promised LT=1 but NO concluded periods show arrivals yet, so per playbook we cannot infer actual LT; treat LT as uncertain and do NOT assume any arrivals during this decision. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand 0, in-transit 0, so no stock to meet current period demand; any order placed now will only affect future periods. e) Order logic: Match expected demand for the next 14-day period while avoiding excess holding given high holding cost ($1/unit/period, half of unit profit). Place a conservative order equal to the historical mean forecast \u2248 401 units (rounded).",
