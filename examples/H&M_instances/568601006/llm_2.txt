{
  "rationale": "a) Date/news: Period start 2019-03-18 (spring season, no holiday signal). b) Demand regime: historical unified samples for SKU 568601006 = [306,375,413,482,429]; mean = 401 units/period, no recent history in this environment to indicate a regime shift. c) Lead time / missing orders: on-hand=0, in-transit=0; promised LT=1 but no concluded arrivals exist yet to confirm drift. d) Inventory & pipeline: zero stock and zero pipeline, so all demand must be met by new order arriving (subject to LT uncertainty). e) Final order logic: target expected demand = historical mean 401 units. Holding cost is high ($1/unit/period) vs profit $2/unit, so avoid significant overstock. Place order equal to expected period demand (401) to balance service level vs holding cost, assuming typical LT=1 will deliver before demand; if future concluded periods show missed arrivals, adjust subsequent orders and safety stock.",
