Period 21 (2019-12-23) Hybrid Decision:
============================================================
{
  "rationale": "Date 2019-12-23: on-hand=0, in-transit=779. History shows supplier usually delivers with LT=1 (most concluded arrivals match orders after 1 period) though one earlier lost/delayed shipment was recorded; nevertheless the 779 in-transit is very large relative to recent period demand (recent demands 562\u2013953, but typical replenishment arrives next period). OR recommended 245 based on promised LT and demand stats; I override and order 0 because a large shipment (779) is already en route and arriving soon\u2014ordering more would raise holding cost ($1/unit) while marginal profit is $2, so keeping inventory lean until the in-transit arrives minimizes holding-cost exposure while preserving service. This decision balances service vs holding cost given high pipeline and usual LT=1 behavior.",
