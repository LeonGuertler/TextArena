============================================================
{
  "rationale": "a) Date/context: Period 1 (2019-03-18). No special holiday signal in mid-March; treat as baseline demand. b) Demand regime: use historical unified samples for SKU 706016001: [1270,1400,1445,1212,915], mean \u22481248 units/14-day period. No in-period evidence of regime shift. c) Lead time: supplier promised LT=1; no concluded arrivals in history to contradict that. Cannot infer delays per playbook. d) Inventory/pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=0, so must order to cover next period demand (cannot serve Period 1 demand). e) Order logic: with LT\u22481, target next-period expected demand \u22481248 units. Holding cost is high ($1/unit/period) relative to profit ($2/unit), so avoid large safety stock; order roughly the mean demand. Action: order 1248 units.",
