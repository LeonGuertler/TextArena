No recent concluded periods to indicate a shift. c) Lead time: Supplier promised LT=1 but no concluded arrival history yet; treat LT as 1 for planning but monitor arrivals. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, in-transit=0, so nothing will satisfy current period demand; an order now will arrive after this period's decision (i.e., in the next period if LT=1). e) Order logic: Balance high holding cost ( $1/unit/period ) against service. Target one-period expected demand \u22481250 units; avoid extra safety stock given holding cost nearly half of unit profit. Place order for 1250 units to cover next period demand and reevaluate when arrivals are observed.",

Per sequencing, I cannot see Period 2 arrivals now. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, in-transit=1250 \u2014 pipeline nominally covers expected demand (~1,200). e) Order logic: Do not place an additional order this period. Rationale: avoid overstock/holding cost ($1/unit/period) given large in-transit shipment that, if it arrives, will meet demand; shipment lateness is unconfirmed (only a single missed arrival), so holding risk for ordering now outweighs incremental profit from extra units.

Ordering logic: because LT=1, any order placed now will arrive for Period 16, not Period 15. To cover expected high demand next period while balancing holding cost (holding=$1, profit=$2), I order to target ~1,500 units arriving in Period 16.
