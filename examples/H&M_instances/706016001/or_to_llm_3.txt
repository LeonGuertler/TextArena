  "rationale": "Date/context: 2019-12-09 (early December). Recent history shows an isolated very large spike (3774 units on 2019-11-25, likely Black Friday) but typical recent weekly demands cluster around ~1,200\u20131,400. Lead-time evidence: multiple concluded periods (through Period 19) confirm LT=1, so the in-transit 280 (ordered in Period 19) is expected to arrive this period. OR recommendation (2255) uses promised LT and high service target; it does not account for the Black-Friday spike being atypical and it increases holding cost exposure. Decision: order 1300. This, plus the expected arriving 280, yields ~1580 units available for demand \u2014 roughly 1.2\xd7 the typical recent weekly demand (\u22481,300), balancing service (covers typical demand and some upside) against holding cost given Profit=$2 and Holding=$1. I scale OR down because its high base_stock is driven by extreme recent demand variability (a likely one-off) and would create excessive holding cost risk for the 14-day period.",

{
  "rationale": "Date 2019-12-23: recent history shows lead time = 1 (multiple concluded periods) and current in-transit=1300 is expected to arrive this period. Demand has been volatile but typical recent weekly demands ~1.1k\u20131.4k with occasional spikes (one large outlier 3.7k). OR recommends 1407 units using promised LT and historical stats. Given we already have 1300 units inbound that should cover a normal high demand period, ordering the full OR recommendation would risk heavier holding costs. I therefore scale OR down: place a modest top-up to provide safety stock against volatility but avoid excessive holding.
