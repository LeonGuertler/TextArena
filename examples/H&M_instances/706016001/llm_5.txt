  "rationale": "Date/news: Period 15 (2019-09-30) \u2014 late Sep; apparel (jeans) recently spiked in demand. Demand regime: recent demands very high (P13=1448, P14=2135). Historical mean samples were lower, but P13-14 average = 1791.5 suggesting a new high-demand regime unless contradicted. Lead time vs missing orders: Concluded periods consistently show lead_time = 1 (many arrivals ordered previous period). In-transit 190 (ordered in P14) will arrive this period after my decision and be available for P15 demand, but any order placed now arrives in P16. Inventory & pipeline: On-hand now = 0; in-transit = 190 (will arrive after decision). That 190 is the only supply for P15 demand; expected P15 sales \u2248190 (unmet demand is lost). For P16 planning: start-of-period inventory will likely be 0 (190 consumed), so P16 demand must be met by an order placed now. Forecast for P16: use recent high regime \u2014 target demand \u22481400 (conservative vs P13-14 mean 1792, balances stockout cost vs holding cost). Final order logic: place an order to cover one period of expected high demand (1400 units) arriving in P16; avoid significant overstock given $1/period holding cost vs $2/unit profit.",
