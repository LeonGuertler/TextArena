Any order placed now will NOT arrive until Period 2 and thus cannot satisfy Period 1 demand. d) Inventory & pipeline: on-hand 0 \u2192 Period 1 will stock out regardless. No overdue arrivals to adjust. e) Final order logic: maximize Profit*units_sold \u2212 Holding*ending_inventory. With profit $2/unit and holding $1/unit/period, over-ordering is costly. Place an order to supply one expected period of demand for the upcoming period (Period 2) \u2248 mean demand \u22481248. Round to a practical whole unit quantity: 1250 units.",

Forecast & order logic: expected next-period demand \u2248 700\u2013850. Because 868 units are expected to arrive (but visibility only next period) and the on-hand is 0, ordering now would only affect Period15 onward. Given high holding cost ($1/unit/period) relative to profit ($2/unit), and significant uncertainty in in-transit reliability, we avoid overstock. We therefore place no new order now and wait to observe actual arrivals in the Period14 conclude before replenishing.",

To be conservative vs. holding cost, target short-run forecast \u2248 1,000 units/period. c) Lead time & missing orders: Concluded history consistently shows actual lead_time = 1 when arrivals occur; some past orders were lost/overdue (Periods 3 and 6) but more recent arrivals indicate supplier generally delivering with LT=1. d) Inventory/pipeline: on-hand = 0, in-transit = 2322.

No external news; typical post-summer/early-autumn demand\u2014recent high peaks in Sep (Periods 13\u201315) but unstable. b) Demand regime: Historical seed mean=1248; carry-over previously noted downward regime (Periods 2\u20136 mean=710.6). Recent realized demand series (conclude demand values) shows volatility with large spikes in Periods 13\u201315 (1448, 2135, 1354) but no sustained reversal signal versus the lower baseline. I therefore remain cautious and use a conservative next-period demand expectation ~900 units. c) Lead time / missing orders: Using concluded messages, actual lead time has been 1 when arrivals occurred. However in-transit=2322 equals sum of outstanding orders from Period3 (900), Period6 (400) and Period7 (1022) which have not arrived by Period15 conclude. Period3 and Period6 were previously flagged as likely lost; Period7 (ordered 1022) also shows no arrival through Period15 hence should be treated as lost/unreliable. Do not count in-transit for planning. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, reliable pipeline=0. Expect next-period arrival only from orders placed now (lead_time=1). e) Order logic: With profit $2/unit and holding $1/unit/period, critical ratio = 2/(2+1)=0.667. Given demand uncertainty and recent volatility but no confirmed sustained demand increase, I target a conservative coverage for Period17 around 900 units (serving ~2/3 of plausible demand), minimizing costly overstocks.
