{
  "rationale": "a) Date/news: Period 8 = 2019-06-24 (early summer). Summer season + recent high realized demand suggests elevated sales vs earlier low regime. b) Demand regime: historical full-sales periods: P2 demand=895; constrained periods show much higher true demand in P6=984 and P7=820 (stockouts limited sold volumes). Recent realized demands indicate a shift up from the earlier P3\u2013P4 mean\u2248555 to ~800\u20131000 range. c) Lead time: Confirmed LT=1 from concluded periods (P1->P2, P3->P4, P4->P5, P5->P6, P6->P7 arrivals). Use LT=1; the in-transit=500 is the order placed in Period 7 and will arrive this period (after decision) and be available for Period 8 demand. d) Inventory/pipeline: On-hand=0 now; in-transit=500 (arrives this period and will be the only supply available to meet Period 8 demand).

Recent true demand estimate for next period \u2248800 (based on P6=984, P7=820, P2=895). e) Order logic: Because arrivals to this period cannot be modified by current order, we must replenish for Period 9.

Given high recent demand but high holding cost ($1/unit/period \u2014 50% of $2 profit), avoid large overstock; target roughly the recent-period demand rounded to a practical whole.
