To balance profit vs holding cost, place no new order this period and use pipeline to satisfy upcoming demand while we monitor for any demand uptick or lost arrivals.",

{
  "rationale": "Date/news: 2019-12-09 (post-November spike likely promotional). Evidence: multiple concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 1 period; recent multi-period demand regime is lower (~700\u2013800 units/period) despite a single large spike (P19=3774) that appears anomalous. Inventory stance: on-hand=0, in-transit=1443 \u2248 covers ~1.8\u20132 periods at the lower demand regime. OR recommended 1256 (uses historical mean \u22481248 and promised lead time) which would overstock given current lower-demand regime and holding cost = $1/unit/period. Decision: defer replenishment this period to avoid unnecessary holding cost while the pipeline suffices for ~2 periods; monitor arrivals and next-period demand before ordering.",

{

Recent sustained demand regime ~700\u2013800 units/period (multi-period averages), but several recent large unmet demands (P19=3774, P20=1337) were lost sales due to zero on-hand then. On-hand=0, in-transit=1443. Target coverage = (L+1)=2 periods \xd7 expected demand. Using conservative current-regime demand = 800 \u2192 target pipeline+on-hand \u22481600. Pipeline shortfall \u22481600\u22121443=157. OR recommends 1264 (uses historical mean ~1248) which would substantially increase holding cost given profit/holding ratio. I therefore order a small replenishment to bring total pipeline to ~1600 while avoiding excess holding: order 160 units. This keeps service against the current ~800/day regime for two periods while limiting holding cost if demand reverts lower.",
