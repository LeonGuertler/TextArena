Promised lead time (used by OR, shown to LLM): 1 periods (1 period = 14 days)
Note: OR uses promised lead time for recommendations. Actual lead times in CSV may differ.
      LLM must infer actual lead time from arrivals and adjust OR recommendations accordingly.

{
  "rationale": "Date 2019-03-18 \u2014 no special seasonality implied for this SKU in mid-March. Historical sample mean demand = 1,248 units (samples: 1270,1400,1445,1212,915). On-hand and in-transit are 0; promised LT = 1 but there is no concluded-period evidence yet to contradict it. OR recommends 1,593 (uses promised LT and larger safety buffer). Given profit = $2 and holding = $1, overstock is costly (50% of unit profit per period), so I prefer a conservative order near the demand mean rather than OR's higher base-stock. Final qty = 1,250 units: aligns with estimated demand (\u22481,248), limits excessive holding while still supporting expected sales under LT=1 and zero pipeline.",
