{
  "rationale": "Date 2019-12-09 (Period 20). Recent history: lead time = 1 period (confirmed through Period 18 arrivals; Period 19 order arrival not yet observed due to sequencing). On-hand=0, in-transit=1200 (ordered in Period 19, expected to arrive this period but not visible at decision time). Demand signal: Period 19 showed a large spike (3774) on 2019-11-25 likely driven by Black Friday \u2014 a plausible one-off surge; prior 4-period average (P16\u2013P19) \u2248 1819 but earlier periods were ~1.1\u20131.3k. OR recommends 1499 units using promised LT and historical mean; that baseline does not account for the in-transit stock I already have. To balance service vs holding cost (profit=$2, holding=$1 \u2192 target quantile \u2248 0.67) and be conservative about whether the Period 19 spike persists, I aim to cover expected elevated demand (~1500) net of the 1200 pipeline. Therefore I order 300 units (small top-up vs OR's 1499) to raise available inventory when the in-transit arrives while limiting holding cost if the spike was transient.",

{
  "rationale": "Date 2019-12-23 (Period 21). Lead time = 1 period (confirmed by arrivals through Period 20). On-hand=0, in-transit=300 (will arrive for demand this period given LT=1). Recent periods show elevated demand vs earlier months (Period 20 observed demand 1337; Period 19 had extreme observed demand 3774 though heavily stock\u2010limited). OR recommends 2241 (based on historical mean and promised LT). I treat OR as a high safety-stock baseline but reduce it because: (a) we already have 300 in-transit arriving this period; (b) evidence supports a higher demand regime but a single huge outlier (Period 19) may be atypical; (c) holding cost = $1/unit favors moderation. I target coverage for expected next-period demand ~1,300\u20131,400 plus some safety. Ordering 1,400 will bring pipeline to ~1,700 arriving next period (300 arriving now + 1,400 next period) which balances service level in holiday season vs holding cost.",
