{

On-hand=0, in-transit=1190 (order placed in Period 19 expected to arrive with LT=1). Recent long-run regime (Periods 12\u201318) showed higher demand (~1189), but Period 19 demand=3774 appears to be a one-off spike and would be satisfied only by on-hand at time of demand; no evidence it will persist. OR baseline recommends 1509; its capped rule starts point but double-counts need because pipeline=1190 will arrive next period. Base_stock - pipeline = 319, so ordering 319 would bring pipeline+order up to OR's target while avoiding excess holding cost given holding=$1/unit (q=2/3 implies modest safety stock). I therefore reduce OR's recommendation to account for the confirmed LT=1 arrival and the likely one-off surge, balancing service level and holding cost.",

OR recommends 2241 (uses long-run assumptions). I start from OR but scale down because holding cost is high relative to profit (Profit=$2, Holding=$1 \u2192 service z\u22480.43) and recent stable elevated mean (~1189) implies a lower target than OR's long-run cap. Compute base_stock = \u03bc + z\xb7\u03c3 \u22481189 + 0.43\xb7433 \u22481375. Pipeline (in-transit) = 319, on-hand = 0, so order = base_stock \u2212 pipeline \u22481375 \u2212 319 = 1056.
