{
  "rationale": "Date 2019/12/23. Recent concluded periods (Periods 19\u219220 arrivals) show actual lead time \u22481, so pipeline counts can be treated as reliable now. Historical single-period mean \u22481248 units; with L=1 OR's base-stock ~2624 units so 2-period demand \u22482496. On-hand (731) + in-transit (2092) = 2823 > expected 2-period demand and exceeds OR base-stock; holding cost ($1/unit) is high relative to profit ($2/unit), so avoid additional inventory to minimize holding cost.
