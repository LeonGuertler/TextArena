Period 21 (2019-12-23) Hybrid Decision:
============================================================
{
  "rationale": "Date 2019-12-23. History shows stable actual lead_time=1 (multiple period conclusions). On-hand=0, in-transit=1800 (this is the order placed in Period 20 and will arrive with LT=1). Recent realized demand is volatile but typical realized demand (~last several periods excluding the one extreme spike) is ~1100\u20131400; the in-transit 1800 already exceeds one-period expected demand and provides immediate coverage once it arrives. OR recommends 907 based on its base-stock calculation, but it does not account for the large pipeline position of 1800 I already have. Ordering additional units now would likely increase ending inventory and incur $1 holding cost per extra unit while only yielding $2 profit per sale \u2014 with sufficient pipeline coverage the marginal benefit is low. Therefore I override OR and place 0 units to avoid unnecessary holding cost while meeting expected demand from the in-transit shipment.",
