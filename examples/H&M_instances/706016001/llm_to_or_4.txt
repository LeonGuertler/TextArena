Period 1 (2019-03-18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. No concluded arrivals in history to suggest lead-time drift. Historical demands = [1270,1400,1445,1212,915], mean=1248.4, std\u2248186.86. Use promised LT=1 (default). Set mu_hat = (1+L)*mean = 2*1248.4 = 2496.8 to cover review+lead demand. Set sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std = sqrt(2)*186.86 \u2248 264.36 to reflect demand variability over review+lead. These defaults balance service level implied by profit/(profit+holding)=2/(2+1)=0.666... while avoiding ad-hoc LT inflation given no missed arrivals.

Period 2 (2019-04-01) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 decision: one expected shipment (ordered 1593 in P1) did not arrive in the concluded period but only one period has elapsed, so do not infer a longer lead time yet. Use promised LT=1. Historical demand samples [1270,1400,1445,1212,915] give mean=1248.4 and std=186.86; apply (1+L) scaling for review+lead. Chosen methods: L=default (promised=1) to avoid overreacting to a single missed arrival; mu_hat=default -> (1+L)*mean = 2*1248.4 = 2496.8 to cover expected demand over review+lead; sigma_hat=default -> sqrt(1+L)*std = sqrt(2)*186.86 = 264.3 to reflect demand variability over review+lead. These parameters keep the OR engine's base-stock sensible while monitoring the missed arrival (keeps safety stock moderate rather than inflating it prematurely).

Carry-over insight: Period1: ordered 1593 arrived 0 \u2014 missed/ delayed shipment observed; monitor for repeat misses before increasing lead-time estimate.

Period 3 (2019-04-15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Promised LT=1 is supported by Period 2 concluded arrival (order placed in P1 arrived in 1 period). No repeat missed arrivals yet, so keep L=1. Use all historical demand samples (no recent changepoint detected): mean=1248.4 -> mu_hat=(1+L)*mean=2*1248.4=2496.8. Demand sample std\u2248186.9 -> sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std=\u221a2*186.9\u2248264.3. These parameters give the OR engine a base-stock reflecting two-period demand with observed variance, balancing service level (profit>holding favors higher fill) against holding cost; cap will limit extreme replenishment.

Period 4 (2019-04-29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 4). Inventory: on-hand=1122, in-transit=814 \u2192 pipeline=1936. History: two concluded observed lead-times =1 (Period2 and Period3 arrivals); Period1 showed a missed arrival but that single miss did not repeat. Therefore keep L=1 (calculate average of observed LT=1). Demand history (samples provided) mean=1248.4; with L=1 use (1+L)*mean = 2*1248.4 = 2496.8 for mu_hat. Demand std (population) \u2248186.82 \u2192 sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std = 1.41421*186.82 = 264.2. These parameters keep base-stock anchored to historical demand while the unchanged LT avoids overreacting to a single missed shipment; they give the OR engine a conservative service-level target while capping orders via the engine's cap.

Period 5 (2019-05-13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent concluded periods show lead times =1 for arrivals (Period2/3/4), with a single missed arrival in Period1 (likely lost/delayed but not a persistent regime shift). Promised LT=1 and majority evidence support L=1. Use default demand aggregation (all historical samples) to keep estimates stable: mean demand across provided historical samples =1248.4 units; with (1+L)=2 => mu_hat=2496.8 units. Demand std dev across samples =186.85; scaled by sqrt(1+L)=1.4142 => sigma_hat=264.34. These parameters keep service level calibrated to profit/(profit+holding)=2/(2+1)=0.666..., while preserving safety stock to cover occasional delivery misses without prematurely increasing LT.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-85.00

Period 6 (2019-05-27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27. History shows consistent observed lead times =1 in concluded periods (Period2\u20135 arrivals all match LT=1), though Period1 had a missed arrival (carry-over note). Demand history (samples = [1270,1400,1445,1212,915]) shows no clear recent regime shift. I therefore keep promised lead time (default L=1). Using all samples (no changepoint), mu_hat = (1+L)*mean = 2 * 1248.4 = 2496.8 to cover review+lead demand; sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all) = 1.4142 * 186.3 = 263.6 to capture observed volatility. These parameters preserve OR's baseline service-level calculation while the carry-over missed shipment is monitored (no persistent LT change yet).

Period 7 (2019-06-10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-06-10. History shows arrivals from orders placed in Periods 1\u20135 consistently had observed lead_time=1 (Period2\u20136 conclude entries); one early missed arrival (Period1 ordered arrived=0) was previously noted but subsequent periods confirm LT=1. Demand history (provided samples) has mean=1248.4 and std\u2248195.95. I set L by averaging observed lead times (=1). I use default mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_all = 2*1248.4 = 2496.8 to capture demand over review+lead period. I set sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std_all = sqrt(2)*195.95 \u2248 277.13 to reflect observed variability. These parameters keep the OR engine's base-stock sized for two-period exposure while keeping safety stock to cover the one earlier missed shipment without increasing L; this balances the $2 profit vs $1 holding cost (q=0.666) to favor service but avoid over-reacting to a single miss.

Period 8 (2019-06-24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24. History shows one missed arrival in Period1 but every concluded period with an arrival reports lead time=1 thereafter; no sustained lead-time drift. Use promised LT=1. Demand historical samples (provided) have mean=1248.4 and std\u2248186.85; use default formulas to cover review+lead period (1+L)=2. This keeps service level driven by observed demand variability while avoiding overreacting to the single missed shipment.

Period 9 (2019-07-08) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
No new news; history shows mostly consistent 1-period arrivals except Period1 miss (carry-over note). I keep L at the promised lead time (1). I compute demand stats from Periods 1\u20138 (mean demand=750.5, sample std\u2248199.69). Using default formulas with (1+L)=2 gives mu_hat=1501.0 and sigma_hat\u2248282.4. These parameters keep the OR engine's base-stock tied to observed mean demand while the elevated sigma preserves safety stock against the earlier missed shipment.

Daily Reward (R_t): $773.00

Period 10 (2019-07-22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent concluded history (Periods 1\u20139) shows consistent observed lead times of 1 (Period2..9 arrivals all had lead_time=1); earlier Period1 missing arrival was resolved in Period2 and is treated as a one-off. I therefore keep L at the promised lead time = 1. Using all 9 demand samples (period demands = [1013,895,530,580,564,984,820,618,762]) gives mean demand = 751.78; std \u2248 186.76. Applying the default (1+L) scaling: mu_hat = 2 * 751.78 = 1503.56 units (demand across review+lead). sigma_hat = sqrt(2) * 186.76 = 264.10. These parameters use full-history estimates while retaining the promised LT; they produce a base-stock tuned to the observed demand mean and variance and keep safety stock moderate given profit/holding (profit=$2, holding=$1) to balance service level vs. holding cost.

Period 11 (2019-08-05) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent history shows one missed arrival (Period1) but that shipment arrived next period; no persistent lead-time shift detected. Use promised lead time. Demand samples (1270,1400,1445,1212,915) have mean=1248.4 and std=186.86; with L=1 set mu_hat=(1+L)*mean=2496.8 and sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std=264.3. This keeps the OR engine's base-stock responsive to observed demand while the moderate safety buffer (via sigma) guards against occasional missed shipments.

=== Period 11 Summary ===
706016001: ordered=481, arrived=731 units (ordered on Period 10, lead_time was 1 periods), starting on-hand inventory=1517, demand=874, sold=874, ending on-hand inventory=643

Daily Reward (R_t): $1105.00

Period 12 (2019-08-19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent history shows one missed arrival in Period1 but every concluded period with an arrival lists lead_time=1; no persistent delay pattern. Use promised LT=1. Use full-sample demand statistics (samples=[1270,1400,1445,1212,915]) because no clear regime change or seasonality signal; (1+L)*mean = 2*1248.4 = 2496.8 to cover the two-period review+lead demand. Volatility: std(samples)=186.86 \u2192 sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std = 1.4142*186.86 = 264.3. These settings keep L at the observed regime while the larger mu_hat and elevated sigma_hat provide safety stock to absorb occasional missed shipments and demand variability, balancing the $2 profit vs $1 holding cost.

Period 13 (2019-09-02) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
No credible changepoint in demand mean/variance; observed single missed arrival in Period1 but subsequent concluded lead times are 1 each period, so keep promised lead time. Use default calculations (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std over all samples to let OR backend compute base-stock while the cap will limit extreme orders. This balances service (use L=1) vs holding cost given profit=2 and holding=1.

Period 14 (2019-09-16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent concluded history shows consistent observed lead times = 1 for arrivals (Period2\u201313 all had lead_time=1) despite an initial missed arrival in Period1. Demand history samples (provided) have mean=1248.4 and sample std\u2248209.0. Promised LT=1 is still supported by the sequence of observed arrivals, so keep L=1. Use default (1+L)-scaled mean and sqrt(1+L)-scaled std to supply the OR backend conservative demand over the review+lead period while the capped order cap will limit excessive ordering given observed pipeline (in-transit=814). This balances service (q based on profit/(profit+holding)=2/(2+1)=0.6667) versus holding cost without increasing LT from a single early miss.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1628.00

Period 15 (2019-09-30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-30. History shows consistent observed lead times = 1 (every concluded arrival links to prior-period order as lead_time=1); the single missed arrival in Period1 later arrived in Period2 so no persistent LT shift detected. Current inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=1233 (this is the order placed in Period14 that will arrive after decision). I use L=promised (1). Demand samples provided (1270,1400,1445,1212,915) give mean=1248.4 and sample std=204.07; using default formulas for review+lead period (1+L)=2 yields mu_hat=2496.8 and sigma_hat=288.65. These settings keep the OR engine's base-stock anchored to recent average demand over the review+lead horizon while the elevated sigma preserves safety stock for observed variability; I do not increase L because the earlier delayed shipment resolved and all other arrivals show LT=1.

Period 16 (2019-10-14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
History shows consistent observed lead times of 1 period (multiple concluded periods with arrived=ordered from prior period) with a single missed arrival in Period 1 flagged earlier; not enough repeat evidence to increase L. Use promised LT (1). Use default demand estimates to let OR backend compute base stock and cap: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This keeps service-level target driven by profit/holding while not overstating lead time from a single missed shipment.

Period 17 (2019-10-28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
No new news or sustained lead-time misses: historical concluded arrivals show lead time = 1 for observed orders. Use promised LT=1 (default). Demand samples (provided five-point history) show mean=1248.4; using default (1+L)*mean gives mu_hat=2496.8. Sample std \u2248209.0; sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std = 295.6. These default settings keep the OR engine's base-stock calculation aligned with observed demand and the quoted LT while avoiding premature increases to safety stock for a single missed appearance in Period1.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2176.00

Period 18 (2019-11-11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
No new news; observed concluded lead times are consistently 1 period (all concluded arrivals document lead_time=1). Use promised/default lead time. Demand historical samples = [1270,1400,1445,1212,915], mean=1248.4. With L=1 set mu_hat = (1+L)*mean = 2*1248.4 = 2496.8. Use default sigma: std(samples)=186.86 (population), sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std = 1.4142*186.86 = 264.21. These parameters keep the OR engine on the documented lead-time regime and reflect recent mean demand while providing safety stock for variability; no new carry-over insight warranted.

Period 19 (2019-11-25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25. On\u2010hand=8, in\u2010transit=1154. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 1 (Period2\u201318 arrivals show LT=1); Period1 missed arrival was a one\u2010off. Demand samples (seed) = [1270,1400,1445,1212,915], mean=1248.4, std\u2248186.86. I use default/promised lead time (L=1) because recent concluded periods show LT=1 and the Period1 miss is already noted but not repeated. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the OR defaults to reflect demand over review+lead (1+L) while keeping safety via the backend cap. This yields mu_hat=(1+1)*mean=2496.8 and sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std\u2248264.28, which balances higher service (low profit margin: profit=$2 vs holding=$1 \u2192 q=2/(2+1)=0.666) against holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09. Pipeline shows 1132 in-transit, on-hand 0; recent concluded history (Periods 2\u201319) consistently shows observed lead times = 1 when arrivals occurred. One early miss (Period1 ordered arrived=0) noted but no repeat misses in concluded periods. Use promised LT=1. Demand historical samples provided (1270,1400,1445,1212,915) => mean=1248.4, std(sample)=208.96. With L=1 set mu_hat = (1+L)*mean = 2496.8 and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std = 295.6. These parameters keep OR baseline service-level calibration (q from profit/(profit+holding)=2/(2+1)=0.6667) while reflecting observed variability and the single-period lead time; do not yet increase LT or inflate safety stock because no repeat delayed arrivals in concluded history.

Period 21 (2019-12-23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23. Historical concluded periods show consistent observed lead times of 1 (many periods with ordered on Period t arriving in t+1); the single missed arrival in Period 1 is already noted but not recurring. Recent demand samples provided: [1270,1400,1445,1212,915] (mean=1248.4, sd(pop)=186.86). Promised LT=1 is retained. I use default formulas to let the OR backend compute base-stock and cap reliably: L=promised (1), mu_hat=(1+L)*mean(all samples)=2*1248.4=2496.8, sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples)=sqrt(2)*186.86=264.3. These settings reflect current demand evidence, keep service level per profit/holding tradeoff, and avoid escalating lead-time until repeat delays appear.
