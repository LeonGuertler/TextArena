Historical prior demand (unconditional samples) mean \u22481248 units/14-day period (samples: 1270,1400,1445,1212,915). Demand regime: no recent on-shelf sales history in this run, so use sample mean as best forecast for next period. Lead time: supplier promised LT=1 and no concluded periods exist yet to contradict it; assume LT=1. Inventory/pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=0, so an order placed now (Period 1) will arrive in Period 2 before demand for Period 2. Tradeoff: profit $2/unit vs holding $1/unit/period \u2014 holding cost is high, so avoid large safety stock. Final order logic: target expected Period-2 demand \u22481250 units; avoid extra safety beyond small rounding because holding is costly. Order 1250 units to arrive for next period demand.",
