============================================================
{
  "rationale": "a) Date/news: Period start 2019-03-18 (mid-March). No special holiday effect; spring season \u2014 no obvious demand shock. b) Demand regime: Use unified historical samples for SKU 706016001: [1270, 1400, 1445, 1212, 915]; mean \u22481248 units/period. No evidence in history of a regime shift. c) Lead time vs missing orders: On-hand=0, in-transit=0. No concluded periods showing arrivals, so infer nothing new; supplier promised LT=1 but actual LT must be confirmed from concluded periods later. d) Inventory & pipeline: Nothing available to meet current period's demand. Orders placed now will not be visible as arrivals until after next decision (per sequencing), so cannot help current-period demand. e) Final order logic: Place a replenishment to cover a typical period demand for upcoming periods while being conservative about holding costs. Forecast ~1248 units; round to a practical order quantity of 1250 units.",
