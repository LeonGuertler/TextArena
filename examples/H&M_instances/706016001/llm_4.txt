{
  "rationale": "a) Date/news: 2019-03-18 (mid-March) \u2014 no special holiday signal; typical spring jeans demand. b) Demand regime: prior unified samples for SKU 706016001 = [1270,1400,1445,1212,915], mean \u22481248 units/14-day period; no evidence of recent shift. c) Lead time: supplier promised LT=1 but no concluded arrivals in history to contradict \u2014 assume LT=1 for planning. d) Inventory & pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=0, so no stock to meet current Period 1 demand; any order placed now will arrive for Period 2. e) Order logic: target Period 2 demand \u22481248; avoid large safety stock because holding cost = $1/unit/period is high relative to profit $2/unit. Place a near-mean replenishment to cover expected next-period demand while limiting holding costs.",
