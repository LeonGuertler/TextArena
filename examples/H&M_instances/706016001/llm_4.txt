Supplier promised LT=1 but we have no concluded arrivals to confirm actual LT; the 1250 is 'in-transit' but its arrival for this period is unknown at decision time. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, in-transit=1250 (ordered in Period 1).

Ordering now would create another in-transit shipment that (given promised LT=1) would likely only arrive for Period 3 demand. Holding cost is high ($1/unit/period) relative to profit ($2/unit). e) Final order logic: Do not place a new order now to avoid unnecessary holding cost in case the current in-transit shipment arrives and suffices; reassess next period once arrivals are observed and lead time is confirmed.",

Expected demand \u22481,300; arriving stock (1500) likely covers demand with modest leftover. Holding cost is high ($1/unit/period) vs profit $2/unit, so excess inventory is costly. e) Final order logic: Do not place additional order.
