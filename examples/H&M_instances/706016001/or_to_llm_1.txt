Period 20 (2019-12-09) Hybrid Decision:
============================================================
{
  "rationale": "Date/news: 2019-12-09 (early December) \u2014 possible holiday uplift signaled by Period 19's huge observed demand (3774) but that single-period spike is not yet sustained. Lead-time evidence: LT=1 (consistent arrivals in concluded periods). Inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=738 (will arrive this period after decision but before demand). OR recommended 1961 units (uses long-run history and promised LT). I treat OR as a starting point but downscale because: (a) recent multi-period upshift prior to Period 19 gave a near-term mean ~1462 (Periods 13\u201317) which better reflects current baseline than OR's longer-horizon estimate; (b) one huge observed demand in Period 19 is likely a short spike or stockpiled shopping event and not yet proven sustained; (c) in-transit 738 will arrive and cover ~half of that near-term mean, so incremental order should top up expected available stock to meet near-term demand while limiting holding costs. Calculation: target near-term stock \u2248 1,462 units; less in-transit 738 \u2192 order \u2248 724. I round conservatively to 800 units to provide a small buffer against holiday variability without matching OR's much larger recommendation, balancing profit vs holding cost.",

Period 21 (2019-12-23) Hybrid Decision:
============================================================
{
  "rationale": "Date 2019-12-23. Historical concluded periods show consistent lead_time=1 (arrivals observed in P2,P4,...,P20) so the 800 in-transit (ordered in P20) is expected to arrive for Period 21 demand, but that arrival is not visible at decision time. Recent sustained upshift in demand (periods 13\u201317 mean \u22481462 and subsequent high demands through P20) implies near-term demand \u22481.45k/unit. OR recommends 1907 (base-stock using promised LT and historical demand). Because LT=1 and the in-transit 800 will cover only part of expected Period 21 demand, I will not meet today's demand by ordering now (orders placed now arrive for Period 22). I therefore order a sizable but slightly smaller-than-OR quantity to build pipeline for ongoing high demand while limiting holding cost: 1600 units. This positions next-period starting inventory \u2248800 (arriving now) +1600 arriving next period (less any sales), matching expected demand ~1.45k plus a modest safety buffer while reducing excess holding versus OR's 1907 recommendation.",
