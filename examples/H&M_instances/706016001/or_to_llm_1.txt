Using initial samples from train.csv: /Users/tianyipeng/Documents/Operations_Research_Code/25-11-supply-chain-agent/OR_Agent/examples/H&M_instances/706016001/train.csv
  Samples: [1270, 1400, 1445, 1212, 915]
  Mean: 1248.4, Count: 5
Promised lead time (used by OR, shown to LLM): 1 periods (1 period = 14 days)
Note: OR uses promised lead time for recommendations. Actual lead times in CSV may differ.
      LLM must infer actual lead time from arrivals and adjust OR recommendations accordingly.

{
  "rationale": "Date 2019-03-18 (no special seasonality). Historical demand mean \u22481248 units (samples: 1270,1400,1445,1212,915). Promised LT=1 but we cannot observe any arrivals when deciding for Period 1; on-hand=0, in-transit=0. OR capped recommendation =1593 (built from its base-stock plus cap). Given profit $2 > holding $1, some safety stock above mean demand is justified to avoid costly stockouts. OR's recommendation reasonably balances service level and holding cost vs our demand outlook, so I follow it unchanged to ensure coverage for expected demand plus safety stock.",
