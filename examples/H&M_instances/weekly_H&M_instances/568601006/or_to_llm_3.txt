{
  "rationale": "Lead-time & timing: promised lead time = 4, so orders placed now arrive in Period 5 (cannot help demand in Periods 1\u20134). On-hand=0 and in-transit=0, so we will face stockouts in the first 4 periods regardless of ordering now. Demand stats (historical samples [161,145,179,196,186]): mean \u03bc\u0304=173.4, sample \u03c3\u0304\u224820.38. For L=4, total expected demand over (L+1)=5 periods is \u03bc\u0302=(1+L)\xd7\u03bc\u0304=867 units. OR computed a capped order of 207 (base-stock capped by a per-period cap) which is far below \u03bc\u0302 and would leave the pipeline severely understocked once arrivals occur. Given zero pipeline and the rule that order + on-hand + in-transit should cover (L+1) periods of demand, I override the OR cap and order \u03bc\u0302\u2212(on-hand+in-transit)=867\u22120=867 units to refill the pipeline to cover the next 5 periods when deliveries begin to arrive. This balances high expected sales (profit $2/unit) against holding cost ($1/unit/period); delaying filling the pipeline risks forgoing many profitable sales once arrivals begin. I will monitor concluded arrival messages to confirm actual lead time and adjust future orders if shipments are lost or lead time differs.",
