{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: concluded history shows actual lead_time=0 through Period 46 so orders placed this period will arrive during this period and can satisfy Period 47 demand. Inventory & demand analysis: on-hand=192 units. Recent realized demand has been elevated (multiple periods in late periods 39\u201345 averaged \u2248317 units/period), and recent few weeks still show high variability (examples: Periods 43\u201346 demands 169,304,258,128). OR recommended 84 based on historical average and promised lead time, but that would leave on-hand too low if demand remains elevated. Strategy: target available inventory \u2248340 units to cover a high-demand period while keeping holding costs moderate. With on-hand 192, order 150 units so arrivals (lead_time=0) raise available stock to 342 units this period.
