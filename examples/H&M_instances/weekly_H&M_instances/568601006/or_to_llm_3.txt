Demand regime: carry-over insight already recorded \u2014 sustained higher-demand regime since ~Period 27 (recent single-period avg ~293.6). Recent realized demands (P39\u2013P43 = 231, 278, 245, 733, 169) give a short recent mean \u2248 331, but include a large one-off spike (733) likely Black Friday/Cyber spike. Decision goal: cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand at reasonable service while avoiding excess holding cost ($1/unit/period) vs profit $4/unit. Calculation: 5-period demand coverage target = 5 \xd7 recent-mean. Using conservative recent mean ~330 \u2192 target pipeline+on-hand \u2248 1,650 units. Current pipeline = 1,418 \u2192 estimated shortfall \u2248 232 units. Risk adjustment: the 733 spike looks event-driven; demand may revert toward the elevated regime mean (~294). Using that lower anchor (5\xd7294=1,470) yields pipeline already sufficient. Trade-off: ordering to fully cover the highest shortfall (232) risks holding cost over multiple periods if demand cools; ordering nothing risks stockouts if high demand persists. Action: place a modest top-up of 200 units to partially close the shortfall, balancing upside of additional sales (profit $4) against holding cost risk ($1). This increases pipeline to 1,618, giving ~4.9 periods coverage at recent-mean 330 and >5 periods at regime mean ~294. Follow-up: monitor next conclude messages to verify post-spike demand trend and whether arrivals occur as promised; if demand remains high, increase orders; if it cools, reduce orders. ",
