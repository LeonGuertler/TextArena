Period 1 showed an actual arrival of 191 (lead_time confirmed 0) and realized demand=227 (sold 191, lost sales 36), which is materially above the historical mean (\u03bc\u0304=173.4).

Adjustment rationale: Period 1 demand (227) exceeded both the historical mean and OR's base_stock/cap; with no pipeline and a same-period lead time, ordering too little risks further lost sales and foregone profit ($4/unit). Holding cost is only $1/unit/period, so the profit margin (net if sold) justifies increasing the order to meet observed demand rather than strictly following the OR cap.

OR baseline: recommends 305 units using promised L=0 and historical demand; its critical fractile (profit $4, holding $1 \u2192 q=0.8) implies a high service level. Decision: keep a high replenishment to avoid costly stockouts during this high-demand period but trim slightly from OR to limit holding cost given on-hand 23 and recent high order volumes. Final order = 300 units (arrives same period), which with on-hand 23 covers expected single-period demand plus safety stock consistent with OR intent while modestly reducing exposure to holding cost.

Given LT=0, orders arrive this period so they can meet current-period demand, but ordering when on-hand is already close to expected demand would incur holding cost. Target single-period coverage = ~215 (recent mean) + small safety buffer (~5\u201310%) \u2248 226. Ordering to bring inventory to ~226 requires 27 units; however given volatility and existing buffer from conservative sales variability, I choose a smaller top-up to limit holding cost.
