Promised lead time=2 is unconfirmed (no concluded arrivals yet), so arrivals could be on-time or earlier/lost; however with zero pipeline and no safety inventory I prioritize meeting expected demand across the (L+1)-period horizon. Trade-off: ordering up to the full 3-period expected demand (\u2248520) risks extra holding cost if arrivals are earlier than promised, but yields higher expected profit by avoiding stockouts given profit per sale ($2) exceeds per-period holding cost ($1).
