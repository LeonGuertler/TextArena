With lead_time=0, an order placed now will arrive before demand this period, so we should top up to cover near-term expected demand. Profit=$2/unit vs holding=$1/unit implies moderate risk aversion, but given high recent volatility and costly stockouts (lost sales reduce profit more than carrying extra inventory by $1/unit), I increase above OR recommendation.
