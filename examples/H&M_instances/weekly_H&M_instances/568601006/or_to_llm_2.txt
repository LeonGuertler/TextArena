On-hand=0, in-transit=414 (two prior orders of 207 from Periods 1 & 2) but neither has concluded \u2014 treat them as delayed/at-risk until a conclude message confirms arrival. Historical single-period mean from samples = (161+145+179+196+186)/5 = 173.4. OR recommended 274 units using promised L and its capped base-stock logic.\nLead-time & risk assessment: Because both Period 1 and Period 2 orders show arrived=0 in their conclude messages, actual arrivals are unresolved; shipments may still arrive on-time (during later periods) or be lost. We should avoid aggressive doubling-up that creates excess holding if those 414 units do arrive, but also avoid severe understock if they are lost.\nInventory target reasoning: OR's 274 is already a conservative capped order relative to the implied (L+1)-period demand (\u22485\xd7173.4\u2248867). Pipeline 414 covers roughly 2.4 single-period means (~414/173.4), leaving ~2.6 periods uncovered. Ordering 274 adds ~1.6 periods of cover, which combined with the pipeline approaches the OR-intended base-stock while limiting extra exposure to holding cost if the in-transit arrives.\nFinal action choice: Follow OR's recommendation of 274 units. This balances: (a) not over-ordering given substantial in-transit volume that may still arrive, and (b) providing additional buffer because observed demands (284 in Period 2) are higher than the historic mean and the two in-transit orders are currently at-risk.\nDecision communication: Order 274 now and monitor Period 3 conclude for any arrivals; if the conclude confirms lost shipments, increase subsequent orders to restore coverage for the remaining (L+1) periods.",
