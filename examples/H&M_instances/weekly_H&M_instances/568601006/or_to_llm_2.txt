Decision: place order = 207. Rationale: we match the OR cap (207) rather than OR's 230 because (a) the cap is specifically designed to limit single-period over-ordering when pipeline is low and it equals the robust 95%-service cap, (b) current in-transit 207 already partly covers future demand and there is no concluded evidence of lost shipments or changed lead time, and (c) ordering more now cannot help cover the immediate upcoming (L+1) demand because arrivals are at least two periods away \u2014 so avoid excess holding cost by not exceeding the cap.
