Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Product is seasonally neutral blazer; no on-hand or in-transit inventory and no concluded arrivals to suggest lead-time deviations. Historical demands: [161,145,179,196,186] (mean\u2248173.4). Use promised lead time (default) since no concluded lead-time observations exist. Use default demand aggregation (all samples) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean captures expected demand over review+lead periods and default sigma to reflect observed volatility. This balances service level (covering ~3 periods of average demand) versus holding cost given modest profit-to-hold ratio.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). Demand history shows stable recent mean \u2248173.4 (samples: [161,145,179,196,186]). On-hand=0, in-transit=207 but Period 1 conclude shows ordered=207 arrived=0 \u2192 no confirmed arrivals yet; cannot infer actual lead time from a single conclude. Use promised lead time to avoid over-adjusting. Set L=default (promised=2). Use default demand/volatility aggregation so OR backend computes mu_hat=(1+L)*mean_all and sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std_all, preserving service-level calculation while the pipeline arrival remains unconfirmed.

Carry-over insight: Ordered 207 in Period 1 remains in-transit with arrived=0 at Period 1 conclude; possible delayed or lost shipment\u2014monitor for missing conclude in subsequent periods.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). Demand history shows stable historical mean (~173.4) from samples [161,145,179,196,186]. Two recent orders (207 in P1 and 230 in P2) remain in-transit with no arrivals concluded \u2192 evidence of shipments delayed beyond promised L=2; treat lead time as longer to cover risk of late arrivals. I set L explicit=3 to increase protection (covers an extra period of uncertainty). mu_hat and sigma_hat use default formulas so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, maintaining a conservative replenishment target given the longer lead time and the product\u2019s small profit margin (profit $2 vs holding $1) to balance service level vs holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Delayed or potentially lost shipments: orders placed in Periods 1 and 2 (207 and 230) have not concluded by Period 3; infer lead-time regime shifted longer than promised 2 periods\u2014monitor for missing conclude messages.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=711 (orders 207+230+274). No arrivals have concluded for orders placed in Periods 1-3, indicating actual lead time > promised 2 or delayed/lost shipments. I set L explicit=3 to reflect a longer lead-time regime (conservative +1 period) so the OR backend plans further ahead and avoids stockouts given the 0 on-hand and large pipeline. Demand history mean=173.4 over 5 samples; I'll use default mu_hat and sigma_hat formulas so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std consistent with the chosen L.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime appears longer than promised (orders placed in Periods 1-3: 207,230,274 have not concluded; in-transit=711) \u2014 treat lead time as extended until conclude messages show otherwise.

Daily Reward (R_t): $368.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/11 (Period 5). Recent history shows on-hand=60, in-transit=552. Concluded arrivals: Period 4 reported arrived=274 (ordered Period 3) with observed lead_time=1. Orders from Periods 1\u20132 remain unconcluded (possible delayed/lost). Evidence indicates a mixed/shorter observed lead-time for the most recent concluded shipment (1 period) but outstanding in-transit units suggest delivery irregularity. I choose L.method="calculate" so the backend uses the average of observed lead times (reflecting the single observed lead_time=1) rather than the promised 2. For demand forecasting I select mu_hat.method="default" and sigma_hat.method="default" so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing a conservative baseline given limited confirmed lead-time data. This balances service level (by reducing assumed lead time) against holding cost while acknowledging some shipments may be delayed or lost.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime uncertain: one concluded shipment shows lead_time=1 (Period3\u2192Period4), but earlier orders (Periods1\u20132) remain unconcluded\u2014treat lead time as variable/irregular until more conclude messages confirm consistency.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/18 (Period 6). On-hand=0, in-transit=437. Historical demand samples = [161,145,179,196,186] (mean\u2248173.4). Recent conclude messages show two consecutive concluded shipments with lead_time=1 (Period3\u21924 and Period4\u21925) while earlier orders remain unconcluded (possible losses). Using only concluded arrivals to infer lead time, I set L to be calculated from observed lead times (captures observed shift to 1). For demand I use default aggregation ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) to be robust given limited sample size and mixed signals. Volatility uses default to let backend scale std across (1+L). These settings bias toward matching the recent faster observed arrivals while remaining conservative about demand uncertainty and potential lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Recent consecutive concludes show lead_time=1 for orders placed in Periods 3 and 4 (evidence: Period4 conclude: ordered Period3 arrived lead_time=1; Period5 conclude: ordered Period4 arrived lead_time=1). Treat lead time regime as shifted toward 1 unless future concludes indicate reversion or losses.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). On-hand=0, in-transit=437. Recent concludes show two consecutive lead_time=1 arrivals (Period4: ordered P3 arrived lead_time=1; Period5: ordered P4 arrived lead_time=1) after earlier delayed/lost shipments. I treat lead time as shifted to 1 based on the recent consecutive evidence. Set L using recent_N to capture the most recent lead-time regime. For demand I use recent_N over available demand samples to reflect current average demand across the review+lead period. Sigma uses default to reflect overall observed demand variability scaled by (1+L). These choices balance service (shorter inferred L lowers required pipeline cover) while guarding against holding cost by using recent demand for mu_hat and default variability for safety.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime shifted to 1 period (evidence: Period4 conclude: ordered Period3 arrived lead_time=1; Period5 conclude: ordered Period4 arrived lead_time=1).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01): recent concludes (Period4 & Period5) show orders placed in Periods 3 and 4 arrived with lead_time=1, indicating a shift from promised L=2 to an effective L\u22481; earlier missing concludes suggest prior disruptions but recent consecutive confirms current regime=1. Demand has been elevated recently (recent demands: 198,214,215,215,186); on-hand=0, in-transit=473. I set L to be inferred from observed lead times so backend averages actual observed values. For demand forecast I use recent_N=5 to capture the higher recent mean over the last 5 periods (gives (1+L)\xd7recent mean), and sigma_hat also recent_N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices aim to size base stock to cover (1+L) periods of the elevated recent demand while reflecting the shorter realized lead time and avoiding excess holding cost given holding=$1 vs profit=$2.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime shifted to 1 period based on consecutive concludes: Period4 conclude (ordered P3 arrived lead_time=1) and Period5 conclude (ordered P4 arrived lead_time=1); treat lead time as 1 unless future concludes indicate otherwise.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). On-hand=0, in-transit=473 (includes multiple older unconcluded orders). Recent concludes (Period4 and Period5) show consistent lead_time=1 for orders placed in Periods 3 and 4, signalling a shift from promised L=2 to L\u22481. Demand has been elevated and volatile recently (recent demands: 214,215,215,186,249). To balance service vs holding cost I adopt a short lead-time estimate based on the two most recent observed lead times and use a recent-window demand estimate (last 5 periods) to reflect the current elevated regime while capturing volatility for safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime shifted to 1 period (evidence: Period4 conclude: ordered P3 arrived lead_time=1; Period5 conclude: ordered P4 arrived lead_time=1). Older orders remain unconcluded in-transit\u2014monitor for losses.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-04-15 (Period 10). On-hand=0, in-transit=473. Recent concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=1 for orders placed in Periods 3 and 4 (Period4 conclude: ordered P3 arrived lead_time=1; Period5 conclude: ordered P4 arrived lead_time=1). Older shipments remain unconcluded but recent consecutive concludes indicate the lead-time regime has shifted to 1 period. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times so backend will use the empirical average (reflecting recent lead_time=1 observations). Demand forecast and uncertainty will use default historical methods ((1+L)\xd7mean, sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to avoid overfitting to short-term noise given mixed-conclude history; this balances service level versus holding cost while we monitor for further conclude evidence or lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime shifted to 1 period based on consecutive concludes (Period4 conclude: ordered P3 arrived lead_time=1; Period5 conclude: ordered P4 arrived lead_time=1). Monitor older in-transit orders for potential loss.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/22 Period 11. On-hand=0, in-transit=437 with several overdue/long-delayed shipments. Concluded lead times observed: 1 (Period4 for order P3), 1 (Period5 for order P4), and 3 (Period10 for order P7) \u2192 evidence of a variable/extended lead-time regime. Demand history shows elevated and variable weekly demand. To balance service vs holding cost I set L to the average of observed lead times (captures recent variability). I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as defaults so the OR backend uses (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std of all samples, letting it scale forecast and uncertainty with the inferred lead time while avoiding overfitting to volatile recent weeks.

Carry-over insight: Lead time regime is variable/extended: observed concluded lead_times = [1,1,3] (avg \u22481.67); treat lead time as longer than promised and variable until more consistent concludes arrive.

Recent demand has been volatile with several stockouts (many periods with sold=0) and recent demands (Periods7\u201311) = [186,249,178,130,127], indicating a lower recent mean than earlier seeds but high variability. On-hand=0, in-transit=437 (multiple older orders remain unconcluded \u2192 risk of lost shipments). Observed concluded lead_times = [1,1,3] (orders from P3,P4,P7) \u2014 recent mode is 1 but variability exists; use a short recent average to capture current faster regime while allowing for occasional longer delays. Set L by averaging the last 3 observed lead times (captures recent 1,1,3 = 1.67 \u2192 backend will round/interpret). For demand, use recent_N (last 5 periods) to reflect the most recent demand regime and reduce influence of older low-sample seeds. Use sigma recent_N (N=5) to capture recent volatility. These choices bias orders toward meeting recent observed demand while acknowledging in-transit uncertainty and variable lead time; they balance service level vs holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). Recent concluded lead_times = [1 (P3\u2192P4), 1 (P4\u2192P5), 3 (P7\u2192P10)] => average \u22481.67 and variability present. On-hand=0, in-transit=437 (multiple older orders remain unconcluded) \u2014 risk of lost/delayed shipments. Use averaged observed lead time to capture mixed regime and let backend scale demand over review+lead periods. mu_hat and sigma_hat left to default so backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of historical samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Carry-over insight: Observed lead_times = [1,1,3] (avg\u22481.67) indicating a variable/extended lead-time regime; large in-transit volume (437) with older unconcluded orders suggests some shipments may be lost or severely delayed\u2014monitor for further conclude messages.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019/5/13): on-hand=0, in-transit=437. Concluded lead_times = [1,1,3] (avg\u22481.67) and multiple older in-transit orders remain unconcluded, indicating a variable/extended lead-time regime vs. promised 2. To let the OR engine adapt to observed lead-time behaviour I set L to be calculated from observed concludes (captures the ~1.67 avg and variability). Demand estimates use the default (all-sample) formulas for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all demand samples\u2014this balances service level against holding cost without overreacting to recent zero-arrival noise. This choice hedges against both shorter (1) and occasional longer (3) lead times while relying on full-sample demand stats.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime is variable/extended: observed lead_times=[1,1,3], avg\u22481.67; large in-transit volume (437) with older unconcluded orders \u2014 monitor for lost shipments or further lead-time shifts.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/20 Period 15. On-hand=0, in-transit=437. Recent conclude history shows lead_times = [1,1,3] (orders from P3,P4,P7) indicating a variable/extended lead-time regime (avg\u22481.67) and older in-transit orders remain unconcluded (possible losses). I choose L via recent_N on the last 3 observed lead times to capture the current mixed regime. Demand has been low-to-moderate recently (last 5 concluded demands = [130,127,191,160,196], mean\u2248160.8) so I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to reflect the most recent demand regime and reduce influence of older high-demand spikes. Using recent demand and recent lead-time averages helps the OR backend size base_stock to cover (1+L) periods of near-term demand while being cautious about over-ordering given the large in-transit volume and potential lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime variable/extended: observed lead_times=[1,1,3], avg\u22481.67; large in-transit volume=437 with older unconcluded orders \u2014 risk of lost or severely delayed shipments.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03): on-hand=0, in-transit=437. Historical concluded lead_times = [1,1,3] (avg\u22481.67) and several older orders remain unconcluded \u2192 lead time is variable/extended with risk of lost/delayed shipments. I choose L.method=recent_N with N=3 to capture the recent heterogeneous lead-time regime (backend will average the last 3 observed lead times). For demand parameters use defaults so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect all available demand samples scaled by (1+L) (conservative given volatile arrivals). This balances service (accounting for longer/variable lead time) against holding cost while avoiding overreacting to transient spikes.

Concluded lead_times observed = [1,1,3] (avg \u22481.67) and multiple older in-transit orders remain unconcluded, indicating a variable/extended lead-time regime and risk of lost/delayed shipments. I select L via 'calculate' so backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures the 1,1,3 signal).

Concluded lead_times = [1,1,3] (avg\u22481.67) \u2192 lead time regime is variable/extended. Use L='calculate' so backend averages observed lead-times (captures variability 1,1,3). For demand forecast use recent_N (N=5) to weight the most recent 5 realized demands and reflect current demand level and seasonality; sigma_hat also use recent_N (N=5) to capture recent volatility. These choices reduce risk of over-ordering for outdated regimes while acknowledging recent elevated demand and variable lead time; using recent data helps the OR engine set base_stock and cap appropriate to current regime and large in-transit position.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019/7/22). Demand history shows intermittent sales with historical sample seed; on-hand=0, in-transit=437 (large outstanding, some older orders unconcluded). Concluded lead_times observed = [1,1,3] (avg \u22481.67) indicating an irregular/extended lead-time regime versus promised=2. To reflect observed lead-time behavior while letting backend compute demand coverage, set L via calculate (uses average observed lead times). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all demand samples; this balances service level lift from higher effective lead time while keeping volatility estimate unchanged. This choice guards against underordering given large in-transit and variable arrivals; monitor future conclude messages for reconciling lost shipments.

Use calculated average lead time so the OR engine plans for the empirically observed regime; keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as defaults so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the demand history.

Concluded lead_times observed = [1,1,3] (avg \u22481.67) and many older in-transit orders never concluded \u2192 lead time regime is variable/extended. Recent demand spike in Period 27 (demand=301) increases near-term risk of lost sales. I select L=calculate so backend infers average observed lead time from concluded messages; mu_hat and sigma_hat use default to reflect (1+L)\xd7overall mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7overall std, letting the OR engine balance service vs holding given the inferred L and full demand history.

Carry-over insight: NEW: Recent demand spike in Period 27 (demand=301) indicating higher near-term demand; concluded lead_times=[1,1,3] (avg\u22481.67) and large in-transit=437 \u2192 treat lead time as variable/extended and monitor for lost shipments.

To balance service vs holding cost while accounting for variable lead time, set L by averaging observed lead times (backend will compute) and use recent demand (last 4 samples) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to react to the demand spike while limiting exposure to older volatile history.

Carry-over insight: NEW: Recent demand spike in Period 27 (demand=301) indicating higher near-term demand; treat near-term demand upward and monitor in-transit=437 for potential lost shipments.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/2 (Period 30). Recent demand spike from Period 27 (301) with high subsequent demands (251,231). Concluded lead_times = [1,1,3] (avg \u22481.67) and many older in-transit units\u2014actual lead time is variable/extended. I choose L by calculate (average of observed lead_times) to reflect the empirically observed ~1.67 periods. For demand forecasting I use recent_N with N=3 (Periods 27\u201329) to capture the new higher-demand regime. For volatility I also use recent_N N=3 to reflect recent demand variability. These settings raise target base-stock to cover the (1+L) review+lead window and account for the recent spike while the calculate L accounts for irregular/extended arrivals and reduces risk of under-ordering given large in-transit uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: NEW: In-transit volume increased to 454 units (Period 30) while concluded lead_times remain [1,1,3] (avg\u22481.67) \u2014 treat lead time as variable/extended and monitor for lost shipments; recent demand spike beginning Period 27 persists (periods 27\u201329 high).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date=2019-09-09 (Period 31). On-hand=0, in-transit=544. Historical concluded lead_times = [1,1,3] \u2192 average \u22481.67 indicating a variable/extended lead-time regime and past irregular deliveries; many older in-transit units may be delayed or lost. Recent demand jump from Period 27 onward (demands: 301,251,231,357) signals a higher near-term demand regime. To balance service vs holding cost: infer L from observed concludes (let backend compute average of observed lead times), and forecast demand using the recent high-demand regime (use last 5 periods) for both mean and volatility so orders respond to the spike while capping order sizes protects against lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: NEW: Sustained demand uptick beginning Period 27 (periods 27\u201330 demands 301,251,231,357) \u2014 treat near-term demand as higher; NEW: Lead-time regime remains variable/extended with observed concluded lead_times=[1,1,3] (avg\u22481.67) and large in-transit=544 \u2014 monitor for lost shipments.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/16 Period 32. Recent demand regime shifted up beginning Period 27 (demands 301,251,231,357,328) so near-term demand forecast should use recent samples. Observed concluded lead_times = [1,1,3,2] (avg \u22481.75) indicating a variable/extended lead-time regime vs. promised 2; large in-transit (546) with past missing/late shipments suggests variability rather than consistent 2. I set L to 'calculate' to let backend average observed lead times, use mu_hat recent_N with N=5 to capture the sustained uptick (periods 27\u201331), and sigma_hat recent_N with N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias orders toward meeting elevated near-term demand while acknowledging lead-time variability to avoid understock from delayed arrivals.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23): recent demand spike and sustained uplift from Period 27 onward (periods 27\u201332 demands: 301,251,231,357,328,341). Large in-transit volume (601) and mixed concluded lead_times (observed = [1,1,3,2,1], avg\u22481.6) imply a variable/extended lead-time regime. Set L via 'calculate' to let backend average observed lead times. For demand forecast, use recent_N over the detected higher-demand regime (N=6, periods 27\u201332) so mu_hat reflects the sustained uptick across the review+lead window. Match sigma_hat to recent volatility in that same regime (recent_N, N=6). This biases orders upward to cover the higher near-term demand while accounting for observed variable lead times and elevated in-transit risk.

Carry-over insight: NEW: Sustained demand uptick beginning Period 27 (periods 27\u201332 demands 301,251,231,357,328,341) \u2014 treat near-term demand as higher; NEW: Lead-time regime variable/extended with recent observed lead_times=[1,1,3,2,1] (avg\u22481.6) and large in-transit=601 \u2014 monitor for lost or delayed shipments.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/30 (Period 34). Recent history shows a sustained demand uptick starting Period 27 (periods 27\u201333 high: 301,251,231,357,328,341,612) and large in-transit stock (544) with concluded lead_times variable (recent sequence includes 1,1,3,2,1,3; avg \u22481.6). Many earlier orders were delayed or lost, so lead time is irregular. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the average of observed concluded lead times (captures variable regime). For demand I use recent_N with N=7 (regime since Period 27 \u2192 use last 7 demand samples) to raise mu_hat for the sustained uptick. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N N=7 to reflect recent volatility. These choices increase the base-stock to cover the higher near-term demand and account for increased variability and irregular lead time while avoiding overcommitting beyond observed recent demand.

Carry-over insight: NEW: Sustained demand uptick beginning Period 27 (evidence: demands in Periods 27\u201333 = 301,251,231,357,328,341,612). NEW: Lead-time regime remains variable/extended with recent concluded lead_times = [1,1,3,2,1,3] (avg\u22481.6) and large in-transit=544 \u2014 risk of delayed or lost shipments.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019/10/07). Demand shows a sustained uptick beginning Period 27 (high demands in Periods 27\u201334). On-hand=0, in-transit=736 (large). Concluded lead_times = [1,1,3,2,1,3,1] (avg \u22481.71) \u2014 lead time regime is variable/extended vs promised=2. To capture the empirical lead-time distribution use calculate (average observed). For demand forecasting, use a recent-regime estimate to reflect the sustained uptick: recent_N with N=8 (Periods 27\u201334) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets (1+L)\xd7recent mean and volatility over the high-demand regime. These parameters balance service (respond to higher recent demand and variable lead time) against holding cost given large in-transit volume.

Carry-over insight: NEW: In-transit volume increased to 736 at Period 35; NEW: Observed concluded lead_times=[1,1,3,2,1,3,1], avg\u22481.71 indicating variable/extended lead time vs promised 2.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-14 (Period 36). On-hand=0, in-transit=682. Recent concluded lead_times = [1,1,3,2,1,3,1,3] (avg\u22481.88) \u2014 lead time is variable and slightly below/around promised 2 but inconsistent. Demand shows a sustained uptick starting Period 27 (periods 27\u201335 demands: 301,251,231,357,328,341,612,283, ?), so recent regime mean is higher than the long-run sample. To capture the variable lead-time regime I ask the backend to calculate L from observed concludes (method=calculate). For demand I use recent samples since Period 27 to reflect the higher near-term demand: mu_hat and sigma_hat set via recent_N with N=9 (periods 27\u201335) so the OR engine will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std on the recent regime. This balances service level (raise base-stock for the demand spike) while letting the backend use observed lead-time behavior and volatility to cap order size; monitoring of in-transit remains necessary given prior lost/delayed shipments.

Carry-over insight: NEW: Sustained demand uptick beginning Period 27 (periods 27\u201335 show much higher demand vs earlier history); NEW: Lead-time regime remains variable/extended with recent concluded lead_times averaging \u22481.9 and large in-transit volume (682) \u2014 monitor for delayed or lost shipments.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21 (Period 37). Recent demand has been elevated since Period 27 (several large demands including 301,251,231,357,328,341,612,313,283,282). On-hand=0, in-transit=739 \u2014 large pipeline but many older orders have been slow to conclude. Observed concluded lead_times (most recent 8) = [1,1,3,2,1,3,1,3], avg\u22481.875 \u2192 lead time is variable and on average longer than 1 but slightly below promised 2. To balance service vs holding cost I set L to reflect the recent observed lead-time regime (recent average) so pipeline coverage matches actual arrival behavior. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent demand samples to capture the sustained uptick (reduce dilution from earlier low-demand periods) so the OR backend computes a higher base stock and cap appropriate for elevated demand while accounting for observed volatility.

Carry-over insight: NEW: Sustained demand uptick beginning Period 27 (evidence: high demands in Periods 27\u201336, multiple values >300 and several >250). NEW: Lead-time regime variable/extended with recent observed lead_times (most recent 8) avg\u22481.875 and large in-transit=739; monitor for delayed or lost shipments.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). Demand has shown a sustained uptick starting Period 27 (periods 27\u201337 largely >250, several >300). Concluded lead_times across history are variable but recent concludes produce average lead_time \u22481.9 (observed lead_times = [1,1,3,2,1,3,1,3,3,1], avg=1.9) \u2014 treat lead time as longer/variable than promised. Use calculated L to reflect observed variability; for demand forecast use recent-period average to capture the sustained uptick (changepoint at Period 27). Sigma uses same recent window to capture elevated volatility.

Carry-over insight: NEW: Sustained demand uptick beginning Period 27 (evidence: high demands in Periods 27\u201337, many values >250 and several >300). NEW: Lead-time regime variable/extended with recent observed lead_times averaging \u22481.9 (observed sample: [1,1,3,2,1,3,1,3,3,1]); large in-transit (507) \u2014 monitor for lost/delayed shipments.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-4 (Period 39). Recent history shows a sustained demand uptick starting Period 27 (periods 27\u201338 largely elevated vs earlier baseline). Concluded lead_times are variable but recent concludes (most recent ~8) average \u22481.9, indicating an irregular/extended lead-time regime vs promised 2; large in-transit (719) with past missing concludes suggests some shipments delayed or lost. I set L using recent_N to capture the current variable lead-time regime from recent concludes. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the sustained high-demand regime (post-changepoint) so the OR backend increases target base-stock to meet elevated demand while accounting for observed volatility; this helps balance service (avoid stockouts given long/variable lead times) against holding cost given holding=$1 and profit=$2.

Carry-over insight: NEW: Sustained demand uptick beginning Period 27 (evidence: elevated demands in Periods 27\u201338). NEW: Lead-time regime variable/extended with recent concluded lead_times averaging \u22481.9 and large in-transit volume (719) \u2014 monitor for delayed or lost shipments.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/11 (Period 40). Recent history shows a sustained demand uptick beginning Period 27 (multiple periods with demands >> historical mean, e.g. Periods 27\u201339 include many values >250 and several >300). In-transit is large (676) and concluded lead_times are variable but recent average \u22481.9, indicating lead time regime is irregular/extended vs promised 2. To balance higher near-term demand while accounting for variable lead time and large pipeline, set L to be inferred from observed concludes (calculate average lead time), and base demand forecast and volatility on the recent high-demand regime using recent_N to capture the uptick without over-weighting older low-demand history. This increases target base_stock to meet elevated demand while the OR backend will cap orders using its cap rule; using recent_N for mu and sigma helps the model respond to the new demand level and observed variability while monitoring for lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: NEW: Sustained demand uptick beginning Period 27 (evidence: elevated demands in Periods 27\u201339; many >250 and several >300). NEW: Lead-time regime variable/extended with recent observed concluded lead_times averaging \u22481.9; large in-transit (676) \u2014 monitor for delayed or lost shipments.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/18. On-hand=0, in-transit=711 (large). Historical concludes show variable/extended lead times (recent concluded samples avg \u22481.9) and a sustained demand uptick beginning Period 27. Many older in-transit orders remain unconcluded \u2014 risk of delays/losses. I select lead time method 'calculate' so backend uses observed concluded lead times average (captures variable regime). For demand I use recent_N with N=14 (regime start Period 27 \u2192 14 most recent demand samples) to capture the sustained higher demand. I match sigma_hat to recent_N (N=14) to reflect current higher volatility. These choices bias orders upward to cover the elevated demand and variable lead time while letting the OR engine compute safety stock balancing profit vs holding cost.

Carry-over insight: NEW: In-transit increased to 711 at Period 41; sustained demand uptick since Period 27 persists (evidence: elevated demands in Periods 27\u201340).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25): on-hand=0, in-transit=492. Demand has jumped starting Period 27 (multiple periods with demands >250, recent sustained uptick through Period 41). Concluded arrivals show variable/extended lead-times (recent observed lead_times include values 2,1,3,1,3,3,1,2,3,2 \u2192 avg \u22482.0) and multiple overdue/in-transit shipments suggesting irregular delivery delays. I set L via "calculate" to let the backend use the empirical average of observed lead times. For demand forecast and volatility I use the defaults so the backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples), ensuring the base-stock and cap reflect the inferred longer lead time while leveraging all historical demand data. This balances higher safety stock (to cover extended/variable lead times and recent demand spike) against holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand uptick beginning Period 27 (evidence: many demands >250 in Periods 27\u201341); Lead-time regime variable/extended with recent observed concluded lead_times averaging \u22482.0; large in-transit volume=492 \u2014 monitor for delayed or lost shipments.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/2 (Period 43). Recent history shows a sustained demand uptick beginning Period 27 (many demands >250, recent peak 733 in Period 42). On-hand=0, in-transit=492 (large pipeline) and concluded lead_times are variable with recent average \u22482 periods and occasional 1\u20133 variability. Given irregular/extended lead times and elevated recent demand, set L to the calculated average of observed lead times to let backend recognize the effective regime. For demand and volatility use recent_N over the recent high-demand regime (Periods 27\u201342, length 16) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the uplift; this increases base_stock to protect service while sigma_hat recent_N captures higher variability. These choices balance service-level (avoid stockouts during the uplift) against holding cost given large in-transit volume.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand uptick beginning Period 27 (evidence: many demands >250 in Periods 27\u201342, including a 733 in Period 42); lead-time regime variable/extended with recent observed lead_times averaging \u22482 and large in-transit=492 \u2014 risk of delayed or lost shipments; monitor conclude messages for concretely resolved in-transit orders.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/9 (Period 44). Recent history shows a sustained demand uptick starting Period 27 (many periods with demand >250, including spikes to 612 and 733) and large in-transit volume (770) with concluded lead_times variable (recent avg \u22482). Several past shipments were delayed or irregular. To capture the observed variable lead-time regime, set L to be the average of observed lead times (let backend compute from concluded messages). Forecast demand using the recent high-demand regime (use recent_N over the regime starting Period 27) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect elevated mean and volatility over the last 17 periods (Periods 27\u201343). This increases target base-stock to reduce stockouts given elevated demand and variable lead time while sigma_hat recent_N captures higher variability; using calculate for L makes the policy responsive to observed lead-time variability.

Carry-over insight: NEW: Sustained demand uptick beginning Period 27 (Periods 27\u201343 show many demands >250 and several large spikes); NEW: Lead-time regime variable/extended with recent observed concluded lead_times averaging \u22482; large in-transit volume=770 \u2014 risk of delayed or lost shipments; monitor conclude messages to confirm arrivals.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019/12/16): recent sustained demand uptick since Period 27 (many weeks with demands >250 and several spikes) while large in-transit stock exists but shipments have been irregular. On-hand=0, in-transit=770 \u2014 risk of lost/delayed arrivals. Use lead-time estimate derived from observed concludes (variable/extended vs promised) so backend averages observed lead times. For demand, use a recent-window estimate to capture the sustained upswing (reduces understock risk). For volatility, use same recent window to reflect higher variability during the spike. These choices increase base-stock to protect service during the elevated-demand regime and account for irregular arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand uptick beginning Period 27 persists (many demands >250 across Periods 27\u201344); lead-time regime remains variable/extended with recent concluded lead_times averaging \u22482; large in-transit volume=770 \u2014 monitor for delayed or lost shipments.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/23 (Period 46). On-hand=0, in-transit=770. Historical concluded lead_times (observed arrivals) average \u22482.0; recent demand shows a sustained uptick starting Period 27 (many demands >250 and spikes). To reflect the empirical lead-time regime I set L via calculate (use observed lead times). To capture the higher near-term demand I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the recent uptick regime (Periods 27\u201345, regime length=19) so the OR backend raises base-stock and volatility estimates to cover elevated demand and variable lead time while acknowledging large in-transit volume and risk of delayed/lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: NEW: Sustained demand uptick beginning Period 27 (evidence: elevated demands in Periods 27\u201345). NEW: Lead-time regime empirical average \u22482.0 based on concluded arrivals; large in-transit=770 \u2014 monitor for delayed or lost shipments.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/30 (Period 47). Recent history shows a sustained demand uptick starting Period 27 (many demands >250 and multiple spikes) and volatile concluded lead_times (mix of 1\u20133) with recent empirical average \u22482. Current inventory: on-hand=150, in-transit=492 (large pipeline; some earlier shipments were delayed/lost). I set L to 'calculate' so the backend uses the empirical average of observed lead times (captures variable/extended regime \u22482). For demand I use recent_N (N=20) to anchor mu_hat to the sustained higher-demand regime beginning Period 27 (covers the most recent 20 demand samples). I set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=20) to reflect recent volatility during the uptick. These choices bias orders toward covering the longer, variable lead time and elevated demand while letting the OR engine compute safety stock given profit/holding tradeoff.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand uptick beginning Period 27 (periods 27\u201346 show many demands >250 and multiple large spikes); lead-time regime variable/extended with recent empirical average \u22482 and large in-transit volumes (risk of delayed or lost shipments).
