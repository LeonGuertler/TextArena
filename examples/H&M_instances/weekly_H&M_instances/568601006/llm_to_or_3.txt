Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. SKU is a women's blazer (seasonally stable); no on-hand or in-transit inventory and no concluded arrivals to infer lead-time. Historical demand samples = [161,145,179,196,186] (mean=173.4, sample std\u224820.38). Promised lead time is 0 and no evidence of delayed or lost shipments, so use default promised L=0. Use default mu_hat = (1+L)*mean to reflect expected demand for review+lead period, and default sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*sample_std to capture observed variability. These settings keep the OR engine's base-stock tied to historical demand while avoiding ad-hoc adjustments given no new evidence; they balance service level (use of historical mean) against holding cost by not inflating safety stock.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 concluded with an on-record lead_time=0 (ordered Period 1 arrived Period 1). Recent demand spiked to 227 (Period 1) above historical mean (173.4). To react quickly I use a short recent-window forecast (N=3) including the most recent demands [196,186,227] to capture the higher regime while keeping variance estimate empirical. L set to observed average (0). This raises the base-stock forecast to better cover the higher realized demand while sigma reflects increased variability so the OR engine will raise safety stock modestly.

Carry-over insight: Demand upward shift: recent demands [196,186,227] -> recent mean 203.0; evidence: Period 1 demand=227 exceeds historical mean 173.4.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/2/25. Two recent concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 for orders placed in Periods 1\u20132 (arrived same period). Demand has clearly shifted upward: recent realized demands = 227 (P1) and 284 (P2) on top of prior series [161,145,179,196,186]. I detect a recent high-demand regime; I use recent_N=3 (most recent three demands: 186,227,284) to capture the new level while retaining one pre-spike point for stability. Lead time: use calculated average of observed lead times (0). mu_hat: use recent_N mean over (1+L) periods -> (1+0)*mean(186,227,284)=232.3333333 to target service against higher demand. sigma_hat: use recent_N std -> std(186,227,284)=49.219 (\u221asample variance) to reflect increased volatility. These settings raise the base-stock to meet elevated demand while L=0 keeps pipeline expectation aligned with observed same-period arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand upward shift: recent demands [186,227,284] -> recent mean 232.33; evidence: Period 1 demand=227 and Period 2 demand=284 exceed historical mean 173.4.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent sales show a sustained upward demand regime (period demands 227, 284, 198) vs. historical mean ~173.4. Concluded arrivals show consistent 0-period actual lead time (orders in Periods 1-3 arrived with lead_time=0). On-hand=56, in-transit=0; expected demand over review+lead is materially larger than on-hand, so replenish to cover the new higher regime. I set L to the observed average (0). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent regime (last N=3 samples: 227, 284, 198) to capture the higher mean and recent volatility, so the OR backend raises the base-stock to meet service while capping orders via its cap.

Daily Reward (R_t): $386.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. Concluded history shows all recent orders arrived with lead_time=0 (Periods 1-4 concluded arrivals record lead_time 0), so use promised lead time. Combine prior sample set [161,145,179,196,186] with observed recent demands [227,284,198,214] (9 samples total) to form demand estimates. On-hand=42, in-transit=0 so pipeline=42; using default base calculations provides a balanced service-level given steady 0 lead time and recent elevated demand. Calculations: mean(all 9)=198.8889 -> mu_hat=198.8889; std(all 9)=38.2707 -> sigma_hat=38.2707. These defaults let the OR engine compute base-stock consistent with observed variability and the profit/holding cost tradeoff.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. Observed concluded lead times for Periods 1-5 are all 0 \u2192 no evidence of lead-time drift; keep promised L=0. Recent demand shows a sustained upward regime vs earlier baseline (recent 5 demands = [227,284,198,214,215], mean=227.6), so base-stock demand forecast should use recent data. Set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) => (1+L)*mean_recent = 227.6. Volatility estimated from the same recent window: sample std \u2248 33.17, so sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std_recent = 33.17. These choices raise the base-stock to cover the higher recent demand while keeping lead-time at the observed 0 to avoid overreacting to lost-shipment scenarios.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25. Recent concluded arrivals show promised lead_time=0 (all concluded lead_times = 0). On-hand=27, in-transit=0. Demand regime has shifted up vs older history; last 4 demands [198,214,215,215] show a stable elevated mean ~210.5. I set L=default (promised=0) because all concluded lead_times = 0. I set mu_hat using recent_N to capture the new regime (N=4) => mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_recent = 210.5 to plan for the near-term elevated demand. sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=4) -> std_recent \u2248 7.229, scaled by sqrt(1+L) => sigma_hat=7.229 to reflect low variability in the current regime. These parameters raise the base-stock to cover the higher recent demand while keeping safety stock moderate given low recent volatility. Ordering is needed since on-hand (27) << mu_hat (210.5).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. Recent realized demand remains elevated vs original seed: last 5 demands = [198,214,215,215,186] \u2192 mean 205.6, std \u224813.11. All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 historically (orders in each conclude had W=0). On-hand=29, in-transit=0 \u2014 no overdue shipments. I set L to promised (0) since concluded history confirms same-period arrivals. I set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the sustained upward demand regime (avoids dilution from older low history). sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=5) to reflect current volatility. These parameters raise the base-stock to meet higher demand while sigma_hat keeps safety stock moderate to limit holding cost given holding$=1 vs profit$=2 (service priority but controlled inventory).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/8. All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 consistently (orders in Periods 1\u20138 arrived same period). Recent demand is elevated vs earlier history: last 5 demands = [214,215,215,186,249], mean=215.8, sample std\u224822.34. I therefore keep L = default (promised = 0) and set demand forecast using recent_N to capture the upward regime (N=5). This raises base_stock to reflect higher recent mean while sigma reflects observed volatility; helps OR backend increase service level without overstating uncertainty.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=48, in-transit=0; setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the observed high-demand regime and current zero lead time.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date=2019-04-22. On-hand=88, in-transit=0; recent demand volatility and some earlier upward shifts recorded but most recent 3 periods show demand [249,178,130] (mean ~185.67) so I bias forecast to very recent demand while keeping promised lead time since all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0. No overdue shipments. Selected L=default(0) to match observed arrivals; mu_hat uses recent_N=3 to capture current regime; sigma_hat uses recent_N=3 (sample std) to reflect elevated volatility. This balances service (respond to recent spikes) vs holding cost by not over-reacting to older high outliers.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29. Recent realized lead times (Periods 1\u201311 concludes) are all 0 \u2192 actual lead time = 0. Demand history (Periods 1\u201311) shows mean \u2248202.09 and std \u224844.41; recent weeks show a downward drift (last 3 demands 178,130,127) but not definitive enough to override full-sample estimate given volatile earlier spikes. On-hand=85, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. I set L based on observed lead times (calculate) = 0 so orders are expected to arrive same period. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to the default (1+L)-scaled full-sample mean/std to let the OR backend compute a base-stock that balances profit vs holding cost while reflecting full demand variability. This keeps service level reasonable while avoiding excessive holding given current on-hand.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06. Recent concluded history (Periods 1-12) shows frequent same-period arrivals (actual lead_time=0). On-hand=21, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Demand history (periods 1-12) mean = 201.1667, std \u224844.53. No new calendar events indicated. I use promised lead time (default L=0) because concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=0. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the full-sample defaults to reflect the observed demand mean/volatility, which balances service (captures elevated recent demand) against holding cost given moderate holding penalty.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 historically; no lost shipments. On-hand=13, in-transit=0 so we must cover one upcoming period of demand. Recent demand in Periods 10-14 = [130,127,191,160,196] shows a higher recent mean than the older 5-sample prior; I therefore use a recent_N forecast (N=5) to capture the current regime. L set to promised/default 0. mu_hat = (1+L)*recent_mean (N=5) = 160.8 units to cover one period. sigma_hat set to sqrt(1+L)*recent_std (N=5) = 29.13 to reflect recent volatility. This keeps the base-stock responsive to the recent elevated demand while avoiding excess holding given holding cost=$1/unit.

Demand history (Periods 1\u201317) mean \u2248188.18, std \u224844.78. With promised lead time 0 and no evidence of lost shipments, use default lead time (0). Use default mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and default sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This provides the OR engine with a baseline demand forecast (188.18 units for the review+lead window) and measured volatility (44.78) so the backend can compute a base-stock that balances the $2 profit vs $1 holding cost while accounting for current low on-hand (87) and no pipeline.

Demand history (Periods 1-18) has mean \u2248185.44 units and sample std \u224844.95; no new, stronger regime change since prior carry-over insights, so use default aggregation to capture full-sample demand uncertainty. Defaults (L=0, mu_hat=(1+L)*mean_all, sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std_all) balance service (covers expected single-period demand \u2248185) vs holding cost by letting OR compute the service quantile using profit/holding cost.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/1. On-hand=126, in-transit=0. Recent demand has cooled versus earlier upswing: last 5 demands (Periods16-20) = [168,118,139,122,73], recent mean=124.0 and recent std\u224831.0. All concluded lead-time observations show lead_time=0 historically. I therefore use L=default (promised=0) and set demand forecast using recent_N to capture the recent downshift (N=5). mu_hat = (1+L)*recent_mean = 124.0. sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*recent_std \u2248 31.0. This keeps target base-stock tight to avoid excess holding cost given current slowdown while preserving service against one-period demand variability.

Carry-over insight: Recent downward demand regime detected: last 5-period mean=124.0 (Periods16-20) vs prior higher regime; evidence: demands [168,118,139,122,73], use recent_N=5 for forecasts until reversed.

All observed lead times = 0 historically. To avoid excess holding given the clear recent downshift, set lead time to promised default (0) and use recent_N=5 for demand forecast and volatility so the OR engine targets lower base stock aligned with the new regime.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-15. Recent demand shows a sustained downward regime vs earlier high season: last 5 demands (Periods18-22) = [139,122,73,116,120], recent mean=114.0 which is well below the long-run mean (~173). On-hand=5, in-transit=0 so we must avoid excess holding while preserving service. Use promised lead time (0) since concluded history shows lead_time=0 consistently. Forecast demand across review+lead using recent_N=5 to capture the downward shift: mu_hat = (1+L)*recent_mean = 114.0. Volatility estimated from same 5-sample window: sample std \u2248 24.55, sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std = 24.55. These parameters reduce target base-stock relative to historical highs, limiting overstock and holding cost while retaining service for observed reduced demand.

Carry-over insight: Recent downward demand regime detected: Periods18-22 demands [139,122,73,116,120], recent 5-period mean=114.0 vs prior higher regime (historical mean ~173); use recent_N=5 until reversal.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/22 (Period 24). All concluded arrivals show actual lead_time=0 historically (orders in history concluded with W=0), so keep promised lead time. Recent demand regime is the recent downward regime detected in prior carry-over (Periods 19-23 demands = [122,73,116,120,120], recent 5-mean = 110.2) \u2014 use recent_N=5 to capture the lower demand regime. Set L=0 (promised). mu_hat = (1+L)*recent_mean = 110.2 to target service for the one-period review+lead. sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*recent_std; sample std of those 5 demands \u2248 20.9, so sigma_hat=20.9.

All concluded orders show lead_time=0 historically. Therefore set L = average observed lead time (0).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). Recent history shows the downward demand regime persists: last 5 demands (Periods21-25) = [116,120,120,63,94], mean=102.6, std\u224824.64. On-hand=17, in-transit=0 so inventory is low vs recent demand; promised lead time is 0 and historically arrivals have been same-period (observed lead_time=0 repeatedly). I set L to promised (0). For demand I use recent_N=5 to reflect the sustained lower regime (N=5 chosen per detected changepoint guidance). mu_hat = (1+L)*recent_mean = 102.6 to target service for the lower-demand regime and avoid excess holding cost. sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*recent_std = 24.64 to capture current volatility. These parameters reduce overstock risk under the new lower-demand regime while allowing the OR backend to compute an appropriate capped order.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/19 (Period 28). Recent history shows a large spike in Period 27 demand=301 versus the recent down/regime values (~114\u2013146). This could indicate a regime shift but is currently noisy (single large outlier). To respond moderately while remaining adaptive, I use a recent_N=5 forecast window to capture the most recent demand level including the spike (Periods 23\u201327 demands = [120,63,94,146,301], mean=144.8). Promised lead time has historically concluded as 0 in all periods, so I keep L=0. Sigma estimated from the same recent 5 samples (population std \u2248 82.82) to reflect elevated volatility from the spike. These parameters bias the OR engine toward a higher base-stock than the older low-regime estimates while acknowledging increased uncertainty.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-08-26. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical arrivals show consistent lead_time=0 (every conclude shows arrived with lead_time 0). Recent demand has spiked (Periods 24-28 demands = [63,94,146,301,251]) suggesting higher recent mean and elevated volatility. I set L using the promised/default (0) because concluded history confirms 0. For demand I use recent_N=5 to capture the latest regime (N=5 covers Periods24-28) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(recent5) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(recent5). This raises the base-stock to cover the recent surge while sigma reflects increased variability, helping the OR engine balance service level vs holding cost given profit=2 and holding=1 (q=0.666.. -> higher z*).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 Period 30. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish to cover immediate demand. Historical concluded lead times = 0 every period \u2192 use promised lead time L=0. Recent demand shows a strong uptick: last 3 demands [301,251,231] average 261, and last 5 demands [94,146,301,251,231] mean 204.6. I choose recent_N=5 to balance recent spike with a noisy outlier (94). Set mu_hat = (1+L)*recent mean = 204.6. Volatility taken from the same recent 5-sample regime: sample std \u2248 83.25, scaled by sqrt(1+L) \u2192 sigma_hat=83.25. These parameters make the OR engine target higher base-stock to avoid stockouts from the recent surge while reflecting observed variability; L=0 keeps orders arriving same period per concluded history.

Carry-over insight: Recent upward demand spike: last 3 periods demands [301,251,231] mean=261.0; this overrides prior downward-regime insight and shifts forecasting to recent_N=5 until reversed.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-09 (Period 31). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistent lead_time=0 (orders arriving same period) so use L=promised/observed=0. Recent demand shows a sharp upward regime starting Periods 27-30 (demands 301,251,231,357 with Period26=146); last 5-period mean=257.2, variance elevated. Following the prior insight (Period 30) that the recent upward spike overrides the earlier downward regime, I use a recent_N=5 forecast to capture the new higher demand level while keeping lead time at 0. This raises mu_hat to cover one period of demand ~257 units and sets sigma_hat from the recent 5-sample volatility (~79) so the OR backend will increase safety stock to improve fill rates during the spike without overstoring for a longer horizon.

Carry-over insight: Recent upward demand regime (override of prior downward regime): Periods26-30 demands [146,301,251,231,357], recent 5-period mean=257.2; use recent_N=5 until reversed.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-16 (Period 32). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent demand shows a clear upward regime: last 5 demands (Periods 27-31) = [301,251,231,357,328], mean=293.6, elevated versus prior periods. All concldues show actual lead time = 0 historically (orders have arrived same-period). No overdue shipments. I set L to the promised/default (0) since concluded history confirms lead_time=0. Forecast (mu_hat) uses recent_N=5 to capture the new high-demand regime: mu_hat = (1+L)*recent_mean = 293.6. Volatility (sigma_hat) uses recent_N=5 sample std = 52.41 scaled by sqrt(1+L) \u2192 52.41. These parameters raise the base-stock to meet the sustained higher demand while reflecting higher variance; keeping L=0 avoids unnecessary pipeline inflation given reliable same-period arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Upward demand regime confirmed: Periods27-31 mean=293.6 (demands [301,251,231,357,328]); use recent_N=5 until reversal.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/30 (Period 34). Recent sharp upward demand regime: Periods29-33 demands = [231,357,328,341,612] with 5-period mean 373.8, large variance driven by a massive Period 33 spike (612). All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 historically, so keep promised L=0. I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the confirmed upward regime (carry-over insights already flagged this). This raises the base-stock target to serve the higher short-term demand while sigma_hat reflects increased volatility to avoid stockouts given last-period spike. Methods chosen: L=default (promised 0) to match observed 0-period arrivals; mu_hat recent_N=5 to forecast the (1+L)-period demand using the most recent regime; sigma_hat recent_N=5 to capture recent volatility for safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Upward demand regime confirmed (Periods29-33). Evidence: demands [231,357,328,341,612], recent 5-period mean=373.8; use recent_N=5 until reversed.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/10/7 (Period 35). Recent history shows large upward spikes in periods 27-34 (notably periods 33 demand=612) but all concluded lead-times have been 0. On-hand=122, in-transit=0 so we have no pipeline. I set L to the promised/default (0) because every concluded message shows lead_time=0. I use default (all-sample) demand estimates to balance responsiveness to the large recent spikes while keeping estimates statistically grounded: mu_hat = 1\xd7mean(all 34 samples) and sigma_hat = 1\xd7std(all 34 samples). This raises target base-stock to reflect elevated average demand while sigma captures high volatility (helps OR backend choose an appropriately sized cap and safety stock given profit/holding tradeoff).

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/10/14. All concluded arrivals show actual lead_time=0 historically; recent demand exhibits a clear upward regime. Recent 5 periods (Periods 31-35) demands = [328,341,612,313,283], recent 5-mean = 375.4 and sample std = 134.02. I set L=promised (0) and use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand regime so the OR engine raises the base-stock to avoid stockouts while acknowledging higher volatility.

Carry-over insight: Upward demand regime: recent 5-period mean=375.4 (Periods31-35 demands [328,341,612,313,283]); use recent_N=5 until reversed.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/10/21 (Period 37). Recent data show an established upward demand regime: Periods 32-36 demands = [341,612,313,283,282], 5-period mean = 366.2 and elevated volatility. All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 historically. I therefore set lead time to the observed average (0). For demand I use recent_N=5 (N=5) to capture the current high-demand regime: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_recent = 366.2. Sigma_hat uses recent_N=5 sample std scaled by sqrt(1+L); sample std \u2248 139.46. These parameters raise the base-stock to meet the elevated short-term demand while reflecting higher variance to avoid frequent stockouts; keeping L=0 preserves the observed fast replenishment behavior and avoids unnecessary pipeline inflation.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28. Recent demand remains in an elevated/upward regime: last 5 demands (Periods33-37) = [612,313,283,282,313], recent 5-mean = 360.6. On-hand=114, in-transit=0 (no outstanding arrivals). Promised lead time is 0 and all concluded arrivals show L=0 historically, so use promised lead time. To capture the current high-demand regime while limiting holding cost, I set demand forecast using recent_N=5 (captures the confirmed upward shift) and volatility from the same window. These parameters give the OR backend an up-to-date base-stock target that balances higher service needs (higher mu_hat) against holding cost via its built-in newsvendor z*.

Carry-over insight: Upward demand regime persists: Periods33-37 demands [612,313,283,282,313], recent 5-mean=360.6; use recent_N=5 until reversed.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/04 (Period 39). On-hand=37, in-transit=0 -> low cover vs recent demand spike. Historical concludes show consistent same-period arrivals (lead_time observed=0 every concluded period). Recent 5-period demand (Periods 34-38) = [313,283,282,313,385], mean=315.2, std\u224841.9, indicating a sustained upward regime. Set L to promised/default 0 (evidence: all concluded orders show lead_time=0). Use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to respond to the current high-demand regime and avoid stockouts given low on-hand and no pipeline. These parameters raise the base-stock and the cap appropriately to prioritize sales (profit $2 vs hold $1) while keeping holding cost managed by using recent volatility.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/18. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistent lead_time=0 (no missing shipments). Recent demand has shifted up: last 5 demands (Periods36-40) = [282,313,385,231,278], recent 5-mean=297.8 and recent volatility ~50.9. I set L to promised (0) because all concluded messages show lead_time=0. Use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained high-demand regime; this raises the base stock to meet higher immediate demand while avoiding excess hold from older low-demand periods.

Carry-over insight: Upward demand regime persists: recent 5-period mean=297.8 (Periods36-40 demands [282,313,385,231,278]); use recent_N=5 until evidence of reversal.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/25 (Period 42). Recent demand remains in an elevated regime. Last 5 demands (Periods 37-41) = [313,385,231,278,245], mean=290.4, std\u224861.64. On-hand=78, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Promised lead time historically observed = 0 in all concluded periods, so keep L=0. Use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the sustained upward regime and avoid understocking before potential continued high demand. This raises the OR base-stock (backend will compute exact order) balancing profit ($2) vs holding ($1) given high recent demand rather than using long-run mean.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). Recent history shows a massive spike on 2019-11-25 (Period 42 demand=733), likely a promo/Black-Friday effect; otherwise lead-times have consistently concluded as 0. To protect service during this elevated demand regime while avoiding excessive holding, I use a short recent window (N=5) to capture the spike-driven increase in mean and volatility. L set to promised/default (0) because all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0. mu_hat uses recent_N=5 to reflect the immediate high-demand regime. sigma_hat uses recent_N=5 (sample std) to reflect heightened variability from the spike.

Carry-over insight: New upward demand spike detected: Periods 38-42 demands [385,231,278,245,733], recent 5-mean=374.4 \u2014 treat as elevated demand regime until reversed (use recent_N=5).

Date 2019/12/9 (Period 44). On-hand=296, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show every past order had lead_time=0, so use promised/default lead time L=0. Recent demand shows an elevated regime; last 5 demands (Periods 39-43) = [231,278,245,733,169], mean=331.2 and sample std\u2248228.1. Set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the current elevated demand (mu_hat=(1+L)*recent_mean). Set sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to reflect elevated volatility and to prevent understocking given high recent spikes. These parameters balance higher service level (reduce lost sales; profit $2) against holding cost $1 by sizing base-stock to recent demand and observed variability.

Carry-over insight: Recent elevated demand regime: last 5-period mean=331.2 (Periods39-43 demands [231,278,245,733,169]); use recent_N=5 until reversed.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/16 (Period 45). History shows consistently observed lead_time=0 (all concluded arrivals show W=0). Recent demand remains elevated and volatile: last 5 demands (Periods40-44) = [278,245,733,169,304], 5-period mean=345.8 and high dispersion. On-hand=126, in-transit=0 so no pipeline cover; to protect service during this elevated regime I use a 5-period recent forecast for mean and volatility while keeping L at the promised 0. This raises base-stock to reflect higher short-term demand while the high sigma inflates safety stock to limit stockouts; using recent_N=5 captures the latest spike while remaining responsive to reversal.

Carry-over insight: Updated elevated-demand regime: Periods40-44 demands [278,245,733,169,304], recent 5-period mean=345.8 and high variance -> use recent_N=5 until reversal.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/23 (Period 46). Recent history shows an elevated-demand regime; last 5 demands (Periods 41-45) = [245,733,169,304,258], 5-period mean=341.8 and high variance. No in-transit inventory (on-hand=184). Promised lead time is 0 and all concluded arrivals historically show lead_time=0, so use default promised L=0. Forecast conservatively using recent_N=5 to capture the current elevated regime: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_recent5 = 341.8. Volatility also estimated from recent_N=5 (population std) => sigma_hat \u2248 199.86. These parameters raise the base-stock to cover the elevated short-term demand spike while recognizing high variance; with L=0 this keeps orders responsive without tying up multi-period inventory.

Carry-over insight: Elevated-demand regime persists: Periods41-45 demands [245,733,169,304,258], recent 5-period mean=341.8 and high variance; use recent_N=5 until reversed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-55.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30. Historical concludes show actual lead_time=0 every period (all orders arrived same period) so keep L=promised (0). Recent demand is volatile but elevated: last 5 demands (Periods42-46) = [733,169,304,258,128], 5-period mean=318.4 and high variance (std\u2248216.5). On-hand=311, in-transit=0 \u2014 on-hand roughly equals the (1+L)-period forecast, so maintain short lead-time assumption but set forecasts to recent_N=5 to capture the current elevated but noisy regime. These parameters balance service (avoid stockouts given large recent spikes) against holding cost by using recent mean for base stock and a large sigma to inflate safety stock for volatility.

Carry-over insight: Use recent_N=5 forecasting due to persistent high-variance elevated demand (Periods42-46 mean=318.4, std\u2248216.5); actual lead time remains 0 (evidence: every conclude shows lead_time=0).
