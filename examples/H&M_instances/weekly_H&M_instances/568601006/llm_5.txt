Historical demand prior samples (given) seed expectation: mean = 173 units/period (samples: 161,145,179,196,186 -> avg 173.4). No on-hand or in-transit inventory. Supplier promised lead_time=0 but no concluded arrivals observed yet, so actual lead time is unknown and shipments could be delayed or lost; therefore do not build large multi-period safety stock. Holding cost ($1/unit/period) is substantial relative to profit ($4/unit), so minimize excess inventory. Forecast & order logic: target one-period expected demand (approx 173 units) to meet current period demand while avoiding extra holding cost. If actual lead_time=0 the order will arrive this period to meet demand; if lead_time>0 we risk stockout but excessive safety stock is costly given holding cost. Thus place an order for 173 units.",
