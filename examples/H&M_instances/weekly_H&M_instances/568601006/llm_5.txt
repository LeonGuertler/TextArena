Historical arrivals show actual lead time = 4 periods (confirmed multiple times). Recent carry-over notes show elevated demand regimes earlier (sustained increases), so assume moderately high demand but falling after holiday. Decision rule: cover L+1 = 5 periods of demand. Conservatively forecast ~250 units/period (captures elevated recent regime but allows holiday cool-down) => 5-period cover = 1,250 units. Current pipeline = on-hand 179 + in-transit 1,195 = 1,374 units, which already covers the 5-period requirement. Holding cost = $1/unit/period vs profit $4; avoid excess inventory.
