Demand planning & lead-time: Supplier promised LT=2 periods; no concluded arrivals observed yet so actual LT unknown and orders could be delayed or lost. Decision timing: Orders placed now will arrive in Period 3 (N+2) and are not available for current-period demand; we must cover current period demand from existing on-hand + in-transit (both 0). Coverage target: guidance says order+on-hand+in-transit should cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand because current period demand occurs after decision and arrivals happen later. Forecast & risk: 3-period expected demand \u2248 3\xd7173.4 \u2248 520 units. Holding cost is high ($1/unit/period vs $2 profit), so avoid large overstock; however starting inventory is zero and lead time uncertainty argues for covering the full 3-period demand to avoid lost sales. Final order: place 520 units to cover ~3 periods of expected demand while accepting holding cost risk given lead-time uncertainty.",

Place a modest order to cover shortfall plus buffer (~100 units) to protect against delay while limiting holding cost exposure.",

Lead time & pipeline: supplier promised L=2 but actual lead_time has been variable (1\u20133); current in-transit=1390 units. Coverage check: using a conservative demand forecast of ~300 units/week (to allow for pre-Christmas uplift) => 3-period coverage target \u2248900; even with higher uncertainty (4 periods) target \u22481200. In-transit 1390 > 1200 so pipeline likely covers near-term demand despite variable arrivals. Inventory/holding tradeoff: profit $2/unit vs holding $1/unit/period \u2192 avoid new ordering to prevent unnecessary holding cost given adequate pipeline.
