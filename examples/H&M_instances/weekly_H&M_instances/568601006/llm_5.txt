Recent demand (P39-P45) averages \u2248268 units/period with spikes (P42 733 on 2019-11-25); conservatively expect ~300 units/period over next periods. Lead time: historical evidence shows variable actual lead times up to 3 periods (observed LT=1,2,3); some earlier shipments were lost/delayed but later history shows deliveries\u2014so assume worst-case LT=3. Inventory & pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=1468 units. Required coverage = (L+1) periods = 4 periods \xd7 ~300 d = 1200 units. Pipeline (1468) > required coverage, so no replenishment needed.

  "rationale": "World/calendar: Period 47 = 2019-12-30 (post-Christmas, winter season -> sustained demand for womens blazers likely moderate\u2013high). Demand analysis: recent periods show elevated and volatile demand (Periods 31\u201336 and 41\u201346). Last 6 observed demands (P41\u2013P46): [245,733,169,304,258,128] avg \u2248306 but includes a 733 outlier; reasonable working demand \u2248280\u2013320 units/period. Lead-time & pipeline: confirmed variable actual lead times observed historically (1\u20133 periods). In-transit = 1368 units; on-hand = 0. Decision logic: using conservative LT=3 -> need coverage for (L+1)=4 periods => target coverage \u22484\xd7300 \u22481200 units. In-transit (1368) already exceeds this target and ordering now would risk excess holding cost ($1/unit/period) with modest profit ($4/unit).
