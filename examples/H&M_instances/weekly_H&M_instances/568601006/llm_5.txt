Historical demand samples (given) average = (161+145+179+196+186)/5 = 173.4 units/period. Demand regime: no evidence of a recent shift in observed history; use historical mean as baseline. Lead time & pipeline: promised lead time = 4 periods; on-hand = 0, in-transit = 0, and no concluded arrivals observed yet \u2014 assume shipments will arrive per promised lead time until evidence otherwise. Per checklist and execution timing, orders placed now will only arrive in Period 5 (N+4) and you must cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand (current period plus next 4). Forecast demand for next 5 periods = 5 * 173.4 \u2248 867 units. Inventory decision: with zero on-hand and in-transit, place an order to cover the 5-period demand to avoid stockouts while we gather lead-time arrival evidence. Holding cost is $1/unit/period and profit $2/unit; holding is significant but stockouts here are more costly in lost profit. Therefore order 867 units (rounded to nearest whole unit).",

Demand analysis: recent 5-period demand (Periods 40\u201344) = [278,245,733,169,304] -> mean \u2248 347.8 units/period, consistent with the elevated regime observed since Period 37 (\u2248366). Lead time & pipeline: lead time confirmed = 4 periods. L+1 = 5 periods need coverage (periods 45\u201349). Forecast demand for next 5 periods \u2248 5 * 347.8 = 1,739 units. Inventory assessment: on-hand = 162, in-transit = 1,190 -> available = 1,352. Shortfall = 1,739 \u2212 1,352 = 387. Ordering logic: place order to cover expected shortfall so we can meet holiday demand and capture $2 profit per unit; avoid excessive overstock given $1 holding cost per unit/period.
