{
  "rationale": "Current on-hand=0, in-transit=1858. Historical sample mean=173.4 but a sustained higher-demand regime (Periods ~28\u201331 avg \u2248291.8) is recorded in carry-over insights. Promised lead time=2, but actual lead times have varied (observed 1\u20133) and some early shipments were lost; however there is no new conclude message indicating recent losses for the large in-transit volume. At an elevated-demand estimate (~290 units/week), the in-transit stock covers ~6.4 weeks (1858/290), which is sufficient to cover the (L+1)=3 period demand exposure plus safety stock while we observe actual arrivals in subsequent concludes. OR recommends 0 (it ignores lost shipments and lead-time drift); I also place 0 to avoid incurring holding cost now because pipeline already provides ample coverage and evidence of higher demand is already in pipeline. Monitor conclude messages next periods to detect any lost shipments or faster depletion; if arrivals fail to materialize, switch to positive orders to rebuild pipeline.",
