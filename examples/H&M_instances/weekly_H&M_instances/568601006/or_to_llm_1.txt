I therefore treat the 535 in-transit as uncertain but provisionally available in future (risk of never arriving). Demand outlook: recent realized demand is elevated (Period1=227, Period2=284, Period3=198); 3-period recent average = 236.3 units/period, well above the older historical mean ~173.4. Decision target: ensure coverage for (L+1)=3 periods of demand because current-period demand occurs after ordering. Required coverage = 3 \xd7 236.3 \u2248 709 units. Current guaranteed inventory = on-hand 0; pipeline shows 535 but is unconfirmed. Net shortfall if pipeline eventually arrives = 709 \u2212 535 = 174. To balance stockout risk (high recent demand) against holding cost and uncertain pipeline, place an order to cover the likely shortfall: 174 rounded to 173 to be slightly conservative.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) Hybrid Decision:
============================================================
{
  "rationale": "Assess lead time: concluded arrivals show frequent 1-period deliveries (e.g., orders on P31\u2192arrived P32; P3\u2192P4; P4\u2192P5), so actual lead time \u2248 1 period, not the promised 2. Inventory posture: on-hand=0, in-transit=667 units. Recent demand: last few periods (P43\u2013P46) = [169,304,258,128], single-period demand \u2248 215\u2013258; recent higher-volatility spikes occurred earlier but latest average (~214) is near historical mean. Coverage: in-transit 667 \u2248 2.6\xd7 recent single-period demand and likely covers the next 2\u20133 periods given LT\u22481. Cost tradeoff: profit = $2/unit, holding = $1/unit/period \u2014 holding cost is material, so ordering extra risks negative contribution if it sits. OR recommends 94 using promised L=2 and historical data; because pipeline already sufficient and actual LT appears shorter, I will defer new orders to avoid unnecessary holding cost and let current pipeline arrive and be observed in conclude messages. Plan: order 0 this period; reassess next period after conclude to confirm arrivals and update LT/pipeline before placing replenishment orders.",
