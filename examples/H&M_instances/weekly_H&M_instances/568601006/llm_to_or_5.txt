Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019-02-11). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. No concluded arrivals yet so actual lead time unknown; promised lead time = 4. Historical demands = [161,145,179,196,186] (use full-sample statistics). Use default L (promised=4) so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this balances service level using full history without overreacting to limited data or phantom lost shipments.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/2/18 (Period 2). On-hand=0, in-transit=207 (ordered in Period 1) but Period 1 conclude shows arrived=0 -> the order has not concluded yet (possible delay/loss) but only one conclude period without arrival \u2014 insufficient to re-estimate lead time. Historical demand samples = [161,145,179,196,186] mean\u2248173.4. Use promised lead time (default) to let OR backend apply advertised L=4. Use default demand/volatility methods so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean (captures the 5-period demand window) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std (captures aggregated variability). This balances service level (use backend's base-stock calc) while avoiding overreaction to a single missed arrival.

Carry-over insight: Shipment ordered in Period 1 (207 units) has not concluded as of Period 1 conclude (arrived=0); possible delayed or lost shipment \u2014 monitor next concludes for confirmation.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). Recent on-hand=0, in-transit=437, past demands = [161,145,179,196,186] (mean=173.4). Orders placed in Periods 1 and 2 have not concluded (arrived=0) \u2014 possible delayed/lost shipments but no concluded arrivals yet so cannot infer a new lead-time regime. I therefore keep L at the promised/default to avoid overreacting to unconfirmed delays. For demand I use the full-sample default forecast ((1+L)\xd7mean) to reflect stable historical mean across 5 samples. Volatility is set to default so the OR backend scales std by sqrt(1+L). These settings balance service level (use full-sample demand to cover L+1 periods) vs holding cost while awaiting confirmation of shipment outcomes in future conclude messages.

Carry-over insight: Shipment ordered in Period 1 (207 units) and Period 2 (230 units) have not concluded as of their respective conclude messages (arrived=0); possible delayed or lost shipments\u2014monitor future conclude messages for confirmation.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (2019-03-04). Mariette Blazer: on-hand=0, in-transit=711 (orders 207+230+274). No concluded arrivals yet; cannot infer actual lead time from conclude messages. Promised lead time remains best prior. Use default methods so backend uses promised L and full-sample demand stats (samples=[161,145,179,196,186]) to compute base_stock and cap. This keeps forecasting anchored to historical mean/variance while the pipeline outcome is observed; conservative approach avoids overreacting to unconfirmed delays.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). Recent concludes show every order placed in Periods 1-4 (207,230,274,268 = 979 total) still arrived=0 and remain in-transit, so actual lead time appears longer than the promised 4 or shipments may be lost. On-hand is 0 and pipeline=979. To be conservative versus stockouts given zero on-hand and strong recent weekly demands, I set L explicitly longer than promised to force the OR engine to plan for a longer coverage window. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as 'default' so the backend uses all historical demand samples [(161,145,179,196,186)] scaled by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L) respectively; this captures the full-period demand uncertainty while letting the OR cap limit order size if needed. This balances service-level pressure (avoid stockouts given missing arrivals) against holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Shipments ordered in Periods 1-4 (207,230,274,268) have not concluded as of Period 4 conclude; all remain in-transit (979 units) with arrived=0 \u2014 indicates an extended lead-time regime or lost shipments; monitor future concludes for confirmation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $414.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18): on-hand=0, in-transit=1038. Historical concluded messages show the Period 1 order (207) arrived in Period 5 with observed lead_time=4 \u2014 supporting promised lead time. Recent demand samples [161,145,179,196,186] have mean=173.4; no strong changepoint in demand. I choose L=default to use the promised lead time (consistent with observed arrival). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I choose default population-based methods so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing a stable base-stock that balances service level against holding cost while acknowledging current pipeline (large in-transit) and avoiding overreacting to transient delays.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead_time = 4 periods for at least one order (Period 1 ordered=207 arrived in Period 5, lead_time=4); monitor remaining in-transit for further confirmations or losses.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). Recent concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (Period1 arrived in Period5, Period2 arrived in Period6). Current inventory: on-hand=15, in-transit=810 (several large outstanding orders). Demand samples = [161,145,179,196,186] (mean=173.4). Given confirmed LT=4, use lead-time inference via calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples\u2014this balances service level vs holding cost using full history while respecting the now-confirmed L=4. This conservative choice avoids overfitting to recent volatile arrivals and accounts for long pipeline of in-transit units and potential past shipment delays.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead_time = 4 periods (evidence: Period1 order arrived in Period5; Period2 order arrived in Period6). Previous long in-transit build-up resolved for those orders; monitor remaining in-transit for further confirmations or losses.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Current on-hand=103, in-transit=756. Historical concluded arrivals show orders from Periods 1\u20133 each arrived with lead_time=4 (confirmed actual lead time = 4). Recent long in-transit buildup largely resolved for those orders; remaining pipeline likely on the same 4-period regime. Use default (promised) lead time to match observed 4-period regime and let OR backend compute base-stock from full-sample demand stats (no strong evidence of a recent demand mean/variance shift given available past-samples [161,145,179,196,186]). Default mu_hat and sigma_hat let backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std, balancing service level vs holding cost while avoiding overreaction to earlier lost/delayed appearances.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/8 (Period 9). Recent concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (Period1\u21925, P2\u21926, P3\u21927, P4\u21928). On-hand=122, in-transit=666 (many arrivals recently completed). Demand has stepped up vs older samples; last 5 concluded period demands = [214,215,215,186,249] (mean\u2248215.8). To capture the confirmed L=4 regime and recent higher demand level, set L by calculating observed lead times, and use recent_N (N=5) for demand mean and volatility so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current regime and balance service level vs holding cost.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/15 (Period 10). Recent concluded history shows consistent actual lead_time = 4 periods (orders placed in Periods 1-5 arrived after 4 periods). Demand samples = [161,145,179,196,186] show moderate variability; current inventory on-hand=210, in-transit=653. Use L='calculate' to have backend average observed lead times (captures confirmed 4-period regime). Use mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' so backend computes (1+L)\xd7sample mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std, keeping forecasting anchored to all historical demand while the lead-time estimate adapts. This balances service (accurate L) against holding cost given positive holding cost and modest profit margin.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/22 Period 11. On-hand=82, in-transit=835. Historical concludes confirm consistent actual lead_time=4 periods across multiple orders (Period1\u21925, Period2\u21926, Period3\u21927, Period4\u21928, Period5\u21929, Period6\u219210). Use lead-time inference to set L via observed data. Choose L.method="calculate" to reflect the empirically observed lead time. Demand exhibits variability but no strong recent sustained mean shift that overrides full-sample stats, so use mu_hat.method="default" and sigma_hat.method="default" to let the OR engine compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the full history. These choices align safety stock with the empirically confirmed 4-period lead time while avoiding overfitting to short-term noise; they balance service level (profit-driven) vs holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained actual lead_time = 4 periods (evidence: Period1 arrived in Period5, Period2\u2192Period6, Period3\u2192Period7, Period4\u2192Period8, Period5\u2192Period9, Period6\u2192Period10).

Period 12 (2019-04-29): confirmed sustained actual lead_time = 4 periods (multiple conclude messages: Period1\u21925, Period2\u21926, Period3\u21927, Period4\u21928, Period5\u21929, Period6\u219210, Period7\u219211). On-hand=175, in-transit=724. No new demand regime detected in given seed samples. Use default methods so backend uses promised/observed L and full-sample demand stats; this is conservative given confirmed L=4 and avoids overfitting to recent noise while ensuring pipeline coverage for (1+L) periods.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). Historical concluded messages consistently show actual lead_time = 4 periods for multiple orders (Period1\u21925, Period2\u21926, ..., Period8\u219212). Current inventory: on-hand=162, in-transit=653. With confirmed L=4, set lead-time via calculate (use observed lead-times). Demand history shows no recent regime shift; use default demand aggregation so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect all samples scaled by (1+L). This balances service (use observed L) vs holding cost by letting backend compute base_stock and cap using full-sample mean/std; no explicit inflation or EWMA needed. Monitoring: if future concludes show lost shipments or lead-time drift, switch to explicit/recent_N methods.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained actual lead_time = 4 periods (evidence: orders from Period1\u21925, Period2\u21926, Period3\u21927, Period4\u21928, Period5\u21929, Period6\u219210, Period7\u219211, Period8\u219212).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). Demand history (samples=[161,145,179,196,186]) shows steady mean ~173.4; conclude sustained actual lead_time=4 from concluded messages through Period 13. Current inventory: on-hand=255, in-transit=589 (total=844) vs implied (1+L)*mean \u2248 867 \u2192 small shortfall but pipeline largely healthy. Use promised/default lead time to align with confirmed regime and let OR backend compute base_stock from historical demand stats. Methods chosen are conservative (default) so backend uses full-sample mean/variance, which balances service-level (profit>holding) with holding costs given modest over-time demand stability.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained actual lead_time = 4 periods (evidence: orders from Period1\u21925, Period2\u21926, Period3\u21927, Period4\u21928, Period5\u21929, Period6\u219210, Period7\u219211, Period8\u219212, Period9\u219213).

Pipeline + on-hand is ample vs recent weekly demand (history shows moderate volatility). Use lead-time estimate from observed data, and let backend compute base-stock using (1+L) scaling for mean/volatility so OR engine balances service level (profit $2 vs holding $1 implies moderate fill-rate target) against holding cost.

Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead_time = 4 periods (multiple orders: Period1\u21925, Period2\u21926, Period3\u21927, Period4\u21928, Period5\u21929, Period6\u219210, Period7\u219211, Period8\u219212, Period9\u219213, Period10\u219214, Period11\u219215, Period12\u219216, Period13\u219217), so use inferred lead time = 4.

Earlier long in-transit build-up has resolved and arrivals now reliably match a 4-period lead time. To reflect observed actual lead time while letting backend recompute demand aggregation and uncertainty from full sample history, set L to calculate (average observed lead times). Use default demand/volatility aggregation so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, which balances service level (captures sustained 4-period lead time) against holding costs given profit/hc ratio.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-08 (Period 22). Demand history shows samples [161,145,179,196,186] and full period concludes demonstrate a sustained actual lead time of 4 periods (multiple orders: Period1\u21925 ... Period17\u219221). On-hand=410, in-transit=399. Given consistent observed lead_time=4, set L to 'calculate' to let backend use observed average (captures realized lead time vs promised). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to base base-stock on full sample history; this balances service level vs holding cost using all data while the backend's cap limits extreme orders. This approach accounts for the confirmed 4-period lead time and preserves stability while monitoring remaining in-transit for any lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained actual lead_time = 4 periods through recent concludes (evidence includes mappings up to orders placed in Period17 arriving in Period21); treat lead time regime as 4-period sustained unless future concludes indicate loss or shift.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019/7/15). On-hand=394, in-transit=400. Historical concludes consistently map orders \u2192 arrivals with lead_time=4 periods across many periods (Periods1\u21925,2\u21926,...,18\u219222), so actual lead time is stable at 4. Pipeline + on-hand currently provides cover; continued 4-period regime implies using observed lead time rather than promised uncertainty. I select L via observed average (calculate). For demand parameters I use defaults so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, which balances service level vs holding cost given steady demand history and confirmed lead time.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained actual lead_time = 4 periods (evidence: concluded mappings from orders in Period1\u21925 through Period18\u219222); treat lead time regime as 4-period sustained unless future concludes indicate loss or shift.

Use promised/default lead time to align with confirmed regime. Use default demand/volatility computations so OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from history; this balances service level (profit $2 vs holding $1) while avoiding unnecessary extra inventory given ample on-hand stock.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Demand context: recent concluded history shows stable demand samples and a consistently confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple order\u2192arrival mappings through Period 25). Current inventory: on-hand=412, in-transit=374. Several early delayed arrivals resolved and subsequent concludes consistently show 4-period lead time; no new lost-shipment signal. I therefore use the default lead time (promised = 4) and default demand aggregation so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This keeps the controller conservative and lets the backend balance service level vs holding cost using the historical demand stats while accommodating the confirmed 4-period delivery regime.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). Historical concludes consistently show actual lead_time = 4 periods (multiple mappings Period1\u21925 through Period22\u219226), so no evidence of ongoing delays or lost shipments. Recent demands (historical samples [161,145,179,196,186] and full history) show moderate, stable weekly demand; current on-hand=371 and in-transit=352 provide healthy coverage. Use default lead time (promised L=4) and default demand/volatility aggregation so the OR backend computes base_stock = (1+L)*mean(all samples)+z*\xb7\u03c3 and the capped order cap; this leverages observed stable lead time and demand without overfitting short-term noise and avoids aggressive extra stock that increases holding cost.

Given stable 4-period lead time and limited raw sample set, use default demand/volatility aggregation so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This keeps parameters aligned with observed lead time, letting the OR engine set a base-stock that balances $2 profit vs $1 holding cost while acknowledging confirmed L=4 and current pipeline.

Period 29 (2019-08-26). Demand has shown variability but recent concludes consistently confirm an actual lead time of 4 periods. Current inventory: on-hand=40, in-transit=532 (multiple concluded mappings show 4-period arrivals). Given confirmed L=4 and no new regime shift, use default lead time and default demand estimates derived from full sample history to let the OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This balances service level (maintain coverage over review+lead) while avoiding explicit over-provisioning despite large pipeline.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019/9/2). Recent demand history shows elevated and variable weekly demand with several large weeks (e.g. 301, 251, 231). On-hand=0, in-transit=747; concluded history consistently confirms actual lead_time = 4 periods. To align with proven lead-time regime and let the OR backend compute pipeline-covering targets, use default (promised) lead time and default demand/statistics so backend uses all samples to compute (1+L)-period demand mean and volatility. This respects the sustained L=4 evidence while letting the capped ordering rule limit order sizes given current pipeline.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-09 (Period 31). Historical conclude messages consistently map orders\u2192arrivals with lead_time=4 periods across many periods; recent concludes through Period 30 continue to confirm a sustained 4-period actual lead time. On-hand=0, in-transit=831 \u2014 substantial pipeline consistent with multi-period coverage. Historical sample mean of the seed demands = 173.4 units (samples: 161,145,179,196,186) \u2192 5-period demand sum = 867. Given confirmed LT=4 and stable demand samples, set L method to use observed lead times and let backend compute mu_hat/sigma_hat using the default (all-sample) formulas so the OR engine produces a base-stock that balances profit vs holding cost while accounting for the 5-period review+lead demand.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained actual lead_time = 4 periods (evidence: repeated concluded mappings orders in Period1\u21925 through Period26\u219230; recent concludes through Period30 continue to match 4-period lead time).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). Product is a seasonal womens blazer with recent high and variable weekly demand; historical concludes show a sustained actual lead time of 4 periods. Current inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=713 (large pipeline). Given the strong, persistent evidence that actual lead time = promised 4 periods and the small sample seed used by the OR engine, use the promised/default lead time so the OR backend uses L=4. Use default demand/statistics (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std from samples) because available historical demand samples should be scaled by (1+L) and the large in-transit position means we should avoid overreacting with short-term recent-N adjustments. This balances service (covering L+1 periods of demand) while avoiding excess holding given holding cost=$1 and profit=$2.

Given a stable 4-period regime and no recent loss signals, use promised/default lead time and default demand stats so backend computes base-stock from full-sample mean/variance. This balances service (avoid stockouts when large in-transit exists) and holding cost by relying on established statistics.

Set L, mu_hat, sigma_hat to default so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from historical samples; this uses the sustained 4-period regime while allowing the backend cap to limit excessive orders given current pipeline and holding cost tradeoff.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). On-hand=0, in-transit=978 \u2014 large pipeline. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead_time = 4 periods; no evidence of recent loss. Use promised/default lead time to match observed regime. Demand seed (historical samples provided) is limited; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This keeps base_stock tied to long-run mean while the large in-transit position reduces new ordering, balancing service level vs holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained actual lead_time = 4 periods through recent concludes (evidence: repeated order\u2192arrival mappings up to Period35 conclude).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21): on-hand=0, in-transit=939. Historical concludes show a sustained actual lead_time = 4 periods (consistent through Period 36). Demand volatility and recent demand spikes exist but no new changepoint. To align with confirmed lead-time regime and let the OR engine compute the demand-review+lead forecasts, use default lead time and default demand stats so backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across samples. This keeps parameters consistent with observed 4-period lead time and leverages the engine's capped ordering logic to balance service vs holding cost given large in-transit.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). Demand history shows volatile weekly demand [161,145,179,196,186,...,313] with recent large spikes but the concluded messages consistently map orders\u2192arrivals with a 4-period lag. Multiple periods confirm actual lead_time = 4 (evidence through Period 37 conclude: orders in Period33 arrived in Period37). On-hand=0, in-transit=830 (matches pipeline). Given confirmed 4-period lead time and no persistent loss signal, use the promised/default lead time so the OR engine aligns with observed regime. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history\u2014this captures long-run demand mean/volatility while the base-stock formula will balance profit vs holding cost. This approach is robust to recent demand spikes while keeping pipeline coverage for the 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Sustained actual lead_time = 4 periods confirmed through Period 37 conclude (e.g., Period33\u219237); treat lead time regime as 4 periods unless future concludes indicate loss or shift.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/4 (Period 39). On-hand=0, in-transit=783. Historical conclude messages consistently confirm actual lead_time = 4 periods across many orders (sustained 4-period regime). Given strong, repeated evidence and the promised lead time = 4, use default lead time to align with observed regime. Demand seed (historical samples) mean supports using the default (1+L)\xd7mean aggregation; sigma use default scaling. These defaults produce mu_hat and sigma_hat that cover the (1+L) review+lead horizon and let the OR backend compute safety stock balancing profit vs. holding cost while the large in-transit pipeline is resolved.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/11 (Period 40). Product is seasonal blazer; observed on-hand=0, large in-transit=969. Concluded history repeatedly confirms actual lead time = 4 periods (many order\u2192arrival mappings matching 4-period lag through recent concludes). Given stable 4-period regime and limited sample guidance, use promised/default lead time and default demand estimates so OR backend uses all historical samples to compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This avoids overreacting to pipeline surge while letting capped ordering limit extreme orders.

LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18): on-hand=0, in-transit=1025. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead_time = 4 periods. Pipeline is large but invisible this period (arrivals will appear in future concludes). To align with sustained observed lead time and let the OR engine compute demand over review+lead, use default promised lead time and default demand/volatility aggregation so backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across history. This keeps policy consistent with confirmed 4-period regime and avoids overfitting to recent volatile weeks while letting the capped order cap restrain order size given high pipeline.

Demand history available; to keep the OR engine aligned with observed stable 4-period regime and avoid overreacting to transient in-transit build, use default lead time (promised 4) and default demand estimates so backend computes (1+L)\xd7sample mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service level (profit $2 vs holding $1) while letting the OR engine cap orders via its cap calculation given the long proven 4-period lead time.

Recent demand context: elevated and volatile (many conclude entries with high weekly demand spikes).

Concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead_time = 4 periods (matches promised), so use promised lead time. To balance service vs holding cost, keep backend's default demand aggregation over (1+L) periods so base_stock reflects full review+lead demand while sigma uses default scaling; this avoids overreacting to recent spikes while the large pipeline limits urgent ordering.

Large pipeline (1030) but on-hand zero implies arrivals will occur per the 4-period regime; no recent evidence of lost shipments. To keep the OR engine aligned with observed steady 4-period lead time and avoid overfitting to short-term spikes, use default (promised) lead time and default demand estimates so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history. This balances service level (cover L+1 periods) against holding cost given high in-transit inventory.

Given strong evidence for a stable 4-period lead-time regime, set L inference to use observed lead times. Demand history [161,145,179,196,186,...] shows no recent structural break requiring a short-window or EWMA; use default demand estimators so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample. These choices let the backend produce a base-stock that balances the $2 profit vs $1 holding cost while accounting for the confirmed 4-period lead time and the large pipeline already en-route.
