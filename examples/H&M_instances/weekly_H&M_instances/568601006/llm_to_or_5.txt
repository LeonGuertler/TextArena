Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/02/11. Recent demand samples = [161,145,179,196,186] show stable high demand for a womens blazer in late winter; no concluded arrivals or lead-time observations exist (on-hand=0, in-transit=0). Use promised lead time and population stats to let OR backend compute base-stock while keeping policy simple given no evidence of lost shipments or lead-time drift. This balances service (moderate profit-driven fill target) versus holding cost by relying on default (1+L) aggregation and population volatility.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/2/18. On-hand=0, in-transit=207, recent conclude shows order placed in Period 1 arrived=0 -> shipment overdue or delayed; no concluded lead-time observed yet so stick to promised lead time. Demand history mean ~173.4 (samples [161,145,179,196,186]). Use default calculations: L=promised (default), mu_hat=(1+L)*mean (default) to avoid overfitting to a single missed arrival, sigma_hat default to reflect historical variability scaled by sqrt(1+L). This keeps OR backend targeting service level implied by profit/holding tradeoff while monitoring for further conclude messages to detect lost shipment or lead-time regime change.

Carry-over insight: Overdue shipment: order=207 placed Period 1 has not arrived by Period 2 conclude (arrived=0); possible lead-time > promised or lost shipment. Evidence: Period 1 conclude ordered=207, arrived=0.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/2/25. On-hand=0, in-transit=437 (orders 207+230) and no concluded arrivals for Periods 1\u20132 => shipments overdue vs. promised LT=2; risk of lost/extended lead time. Choose L explicit=3 to reflect longer-than-promised delivery (practical buffer of +1 period). Use mu_hat default so backend computes (1+L)*mean(all samples) scaling demand over review+lead; this captures recent average demand (mean\u2248173.4) across the horizon. Use sigma_hat default so backend computes sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples) to reflect increased uncertainty with longer L. These settings raise target base-stock to protect service level given overdue pipeline while letting OR engine apply capped ordering to limit exposure to holding cost.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (2019-03-04). Historical demands: [161,145,179,196,186] (mean=173.4). Three consecutive conclude messages show orders placed in Periods 1\u20133 did not arrive (arrived=0), indicating actual lead time > promised or lost shipments. To be conservative against missing pipeline, set L explicitly longer than promised so the OR engine orders for a longer replenishment horizon. Use mu_hat and sigma_hat defaults so demand across (1+L) periods is scaled from full-sample statistics (captures baseline demand variability without overfitting short-term noise). This balances service level (guarding against further lost/late arrivals) versus holding cost by not inflating demand forecast beyond historical mean.

Carry-over insight: Overdue shipments: orders placed Periods 1\u20133 (207,230,274) have not arrived by their conclude messages; evidence: Period 1\u20133 concludes show arrived=0. Infer actual lead-time regime longer than promised (treat as sustained until arrivals confirm otherwise).

Daily Reward (R_t): $368.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). Recent demand high (samples [161,145,179,196,186]); on-hand=60, in-transit=705 with earlier overdue behavior but Period 4 conclude shows order from Period 3 arrived with lead_time=1. This suggests actual lead time \u22481 period. I set L to calculate so backend uses observed lead times; keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default to let backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, which balances service vs holding given profit/holding ratio and current pipeline. This approach addresses prior missing arrivals by updating lead-time estimate from concluded data while retaining demand estimates from full history.

Carry-over insight: Observed actual lead time appears to be 1 period based on Period 4 conclude: arrived=274 units (ordered on Period 3, lead_time was 1 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $317.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period=2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent conclude messages show arrivals for orders placed in Periods 3 and 4 with lead_time=1 (Period 4 conclude: ordered on P3 lead_time=1; Period 5 conclude: ordered on P4 lead_time=1). This indicates the actual lead-time regime is 1 period now. On-hand=113, in-transit=437 (pipeline large). I set L using recent_N (N=2) to reflect the two most recent observed lead times. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from the historical demand samples; with L=1 this targets demand over review+lead and balances the profit/holding tradeoff given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period start 2019/3/25. Recent demand has risen to ~200+ units (periods 1\u20136 demands: 227,284,198,214,215,215). Concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 1 (Period 4 conclude: order from P3 arrived with lead_time=1; Period 5 conclude: order from P4 arrived lead_time=1). In-transit=437, on-hand=0. To match observed faster regime and elevated demand I set L using recent lead-time observations, and set demand forecast and volatility using the most recent demand regime (last 5 samples) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current higher mean/variance. This balances service (covering L+1 periods of higher demand) vs holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead_time has shifted to 1 period based on Period 4 and 5 concludes (Period4: arrived=274 ordered P3 lead_time=1; Period5: arrived=268 ordered P4 lead_time=1).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Recent concludes (Period 4 and 5) show arrivals with lead_time=1 (ordered P3\u2192arrived P4; P4\u2192P5), so actual lead time regime appears to be 1 period. On-hand=0, in-transit=471 (undelivered pipeline). Demand has been elevated recently (Periods 4\u20137 demands = 214,215,215,186); using a recent-window demand estimate keeps the forecast responsive to this higher level while sigma uses the same window to capture recent variability. I choose L='calculate' to let backend compute average of observed lead times (captures the recent shift to 1). mu_hat='recent_N' N=4 uses the last 4 demand observations to scale (1+L)\xd7mean recent demand. sigma_hat='recent_N' N=4 uses recent variability. These choices prioritize service for the currently higher demand and the shorter observed lead time while limiting inventory risk from older low-demand samples.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08): on-hand=0, in-transit=471. Recent conclude messages show actual lead_time\u22481 (arrivals from P3\u2192P4 and P4\u2192P5 had lead_time=1), so use calculated average lead time. Demand has shifted higher recently (conclude demands: 214,215,215,186,249); use recent demand to capture current regime. Choose L=calculate to reflect observed leads; mu_hat=recent_N with N=5 to target (1+L)-period demand using the last 5 demand samples; sigma_hat=default to let backend scale volatility with chosen L. This balances service (higher \u03bc\u0302 from recent demand) against holding cost given in-transit stock and clarified shorter lead time.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). Recent demand has been elevated and variable (recent demands include 214,215,215,186,249,178) and on-hand=0 with in-transit=471. Lead-time conclues (Period 4 and 5) show arrivals for orders placed in Periods 3 and 4 with lead_time=1; earlier missing arrivals followed by these confirms a shift to an actual 1-period regime. Pipeline (471) will cover some upcoming demand but on-hand is zero so we must plan for (L+1) periods. Therefore set L by averaging observed lead times (calculate \u2192 1), and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent demand regime to capture elevated mean and volatility: use recent_N with N=5 (last 5 demand samples) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets service appropriate to the recent higher demand and variability while limiting excess holding.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22 (Period 11). On-hand=0, in-transit=437. Concluded lead times observed from history: orders concluded show lead_times = 1 (P3->P4), 1 (P4->P5), 3 (P7->P10). This indicates actual lead time has been variable and overall longer than the promised 2 at times. Use L='calculate' to let backend average observed lead times and capture the 1,1,3 signal. Demand history (seed samples) is limited and no clear recent demand regime shift is evident; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std of all samples, letting L capture the longer/variable lead time. This addresses missing/overdue shipments by increasing pipeline coverage via a larger effective lead time estimate.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time is variable and on average longer than promised; observed concluded lead_times = [1,1,3] (orders: P3->P4=1, P4->P5=1, P7->P10=3); treat as sustained until future concludes confirm otherwise.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29): on-hand=0, in-transit=437. Concluded lead-times show variability and longer-than-promised behavior (observed concluded lead_times = [1,1,3] from recent concludes; several earlier orders were overdue before arrivals). To capture this regime I set L to 'calculate' so the backend uses the average of observed lead times rather than the promised 2. For demand I use default estimates (mu_hat and sigma_hat as 'default') so the OR engine computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all historical samples; this balances service level vs holding cost given uncertain/variable lead time and leverages full demand history rather than a short recent window.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13 (Period 14). On-hand=0, in-transit=437. Concluded arrivals show observed lead_times = [1 (P3->P4), 1 (P4->P5), 3 (P7->P10)] indicating actual lead time is variable and on average longer than promised. Use L='calculate' to let backend average observed lead times. Demand history available; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from samples, balancing service vs holding given profit=2 and holding=1.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time is variable and on average longer than promised; observed concluded lead_times = [1,1,3] (orders: P3->P4=1, P4->P5=1, P7->P10=3). Treat longer/variable lead-time regime as sustained until future concludes confirm otherwise.

Historical concluded lead_times = [1,1,3] (orders P3->P4=1, P4->P5=1, P7->P10=3) indicating a variable but on-average longer lead time than the promised 2-periods; several earlier orders showed long/no arrivals before these concludes. To capture the observed variable lead-time regime, set L to be inferred from observed concludes (average of observed lead times). Demand history samples = [161,145,179,196,186]; use default demand aggregation so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std to produce mu_hat and sigma_hat consistent with the inferred L. This balances higher effective lead time with historical demand and lets the OR engine compute safety stock given profit/holding tradeoff. No explicit adjustments to demand mean/variance made here to avoid overfitting to limited recent noise.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03 (Period 17). Demand history samples = [161,145,179,196,186]; recent concluded lead-times = [1,1,3] (orders P3->P4=1, P4->P5=1, P7->P10=3) implying a variable/longer-than-promised lead-time regime. In-transit=437, on-hand=0; several past orders were overdue then later concluded with variable delays. I choose L by averaging observed lead-times to reflect the current variable regime (method=calculate). For forecasting demand over the review+lead period I use default aggregation so the backend computes (1+L)*mean of all samples, keeping the forecast anchored to full historical mean while accounting for the longer lead time. Sigma is default to let backend scale historical variability by sqrt(1+L). These choices balance service (by inflating lead-time) against holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead-time regime shifted to variable/longer-than-promised; concluded lead_times=[1,1,3], average\u22481.67 \u2014 treat as sustained until future concludes confirm otherwise.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10 (Period 18). Demand history small-sample mean ~173.4 (samples [161,145,179,196,186]). Concluded lead-times observed = [1,1,3] (avg \u22481.67) \u2014 variable and on average slightly longer than promised. On-hand=0, in-transit=437 (multiple overdue arrivals historically). I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the average of observed concluded lead times (captures variable/longer regime). For demand I use recent_N with N=5 to anchor mu_hat to the full available demand sample (captures current demand level without over-reacting). For sigma_hat I use recent_N N=5 to reflect observed sample volatility. These choices balance service (account for longer/variable lead time) and holding cost (use recent demand stats rather than inflating safety stock unnecessarily).

Historical concluded lead_times = [1,1,3] (orders: P3->P4=1, P4->P5=1, P7->P10=3) indicating a variable but on-average longer-than-promised lead time (~1.67). Several earlier orders were overdue or lost before some arrivals, so I let the backend infer L from observed concludes (method=calculate) to capture variability. Demand sample set is limited; use default demand/volatility aggregation so backend applies (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std across all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given higher effective lead time. This also avoids overfitting to recent sparse/noisy sold periods while acknowledging in-transit stock.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead-time regime is variable and longer-than-promised; observed concluded lead_times = [1,1,3], average \u22481.67 (orders P3->P4=1, P4->P5=1, P7->P10=3). Treat as sustained until future concludes confirm otherwise.

To be responsive to the observed variable/longer regime I set L to recent_N using the last 3 observed lead times so the backend uses the empirical recent average. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the backend computes (1+L)*mean_of_all_samples and sqrt(1+L)*std_of_all_samples respectively, leveraging all demand history while the increased L captures longer pipeline needs.

Use calculated average lead time to let backend blend observed variability; keep mu_hat and sigma_hat defaults so backend uses all demand samples ((1+L)\xd7mean, sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) given limited recent demand signal and to avoid overfitting to sparse late arrivals. This balances service level (accounting for longer/variable lead time) against holding cost while current in-transit stock (437) will be considered by the OR engine when computing order quantity.

LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=0, in-transit=437. Historical concluded lead_times = [1,1,3] (orders: P3->P4=1, P4->P5=1, P7->P10=3) => average \u22481.67, indicating a sustained variable/longer-than-promised lead-time regime. Use explicit L to reflect observed regime so OR backend sizes orders to cover longer pipeline. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full demand history (conservative given variable arrivals). This balances service (avoid stockouts given long/variable lead time and 437 units in-transit) vs holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time regime is variable and longer-than-promised; observed concluded lead_times=[1,1,3], average\u22481.67 (evidence: P4 arrived=274 ordered P3 lead_time=1; P5 arrived=268 ordered P4 lead_time=1; P10 arrived=34 ordered P7 lead_time=3).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/26 (Period 29). On-hand=0, in-transit=472. Historical concluded lead_times = [1,1,3], average \u22481.67, indicating a sustained variable/longer-than-promised lead-time regime and overdue/lost shipments earlier. To hedge service level against this longer/variable lead time I set L explicitly to the observed average (1.67). For demand I use recent_N with N=5 to capture current demand scale from the provided sample set while letting the backend scale by (1+L). Volatility left to default so backend computes sqrt(1+L)*std of all samples. This balances fill-rate (higher L raises mu_hat) vs holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead-time regime shifted to variable/longer-than-promised; observed concluded lead_times=[1,1,3], average\u22481.67 (evidence: P3->P4=1, P4->P5=1, P7->P10=3). Treat as sustained until future concludes confirm otherwise.

Historical concluded lead_times = [1,1,3] (avg \u22481.67) and multiple overdue/no-arrival events earlier \u2014 evidence of a variable/longer-than-promised lead-time regime. To let the backend infer the numeric lead time from observed concludes while keeping demand estimates simple and robust, choose L="calculate" so backend averages observed lead times. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples; this balances service level (by increasing coverage when L grows) against holding cost without overfitting short-term demand noise. This approach also treats missing shipments explicitly via inferred L rather than manually assuming losses.

Many prior promised arrivals were delayed or lost; in-transit stock is currently large (497) so pipeline likely covers multiple periods. I select L="calculate" so backend uses average observed lead times (captures variable longer lead time ~1.67). Demand estimates use defaults so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples; this balances service level against holding cost given uncertain/longer lead times and substantial in-transit inventory.

Date 2019-09-16 Period 32. On-hand=0, in-transit=472. Historical concluded lead_times observed = [1,1,3,2] (P3->P4=1, P4->P5=1, P7->P10=3, P29->P31=2) indicating a shorter-than-promised sometimes but overall variable/longer-than-promised regime (avg ~1.75). Use calculated L to reflect observed variability; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend applies (1+L) scaling to full-sample mean/std given limited stable regime evidence. This balances service level (capture longer lead-time risk) while relying on large in-transit stock to avoid excessive new orders.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). On-hand=0, in-transit=472. Historical concluded lead_times show variability and a recent average > promised (observed concluded lead_times recent=[1,1,3,2], mean\u22481.75). Many past orders were overdue or delayed; treat lead time as currently longer/variable. Demand has risen recently (late Summer/early Fall weeks with high demands: 301,251,231,357,328,341) so use a recent-window demand estimate that captures the current higher regime. Chosen methods: L recent_N (N=4) to reflect the most recent concluded lead-time samples; mu_hat recent_N (N=6) to size the (1+L)-period demand using the latest high-demand regime; sigma_hat recent_N (N=6) to capture recent volatility. These settings increase target base_stock to protect against longer/variable lead times and elevated recent demand while letting the backend cap limit mitigate extreme overordering.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead-time regime is variable and longer-than-promised; recent concluded lead_times = [1,1,3,2], mean\u22481.75 (evidence: P3->P4=1, P4->P5=1, P7->P10=3, P29->P31=2). Treat as sustained until future concludes confirm otherwise.

To reflect uncertain/longer lead-times I choose L by averaging observed lead times so the OR engine accounts for realized delays. Demand has stepped up recently (large demands in recent weeks, including 328, 341, 612), so I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to emphasize the current higher-demand regime and recent volatility. This increases target base-stock to cover the (1+L) review+lead window while capping orders via the backend cap to limit exposure given potential lost shipments.

Historical concluded lead-times have been variable and on average longer than the promised 2\u2192observed concluded lead_times include recent values [1,1,3,2,1] (mean \u22481.6\u20131.75) so use the backend's calculated average lead time to capture variability. Recent demand shows a clear uptick (recent concluded demands: P31\u2013P35 = [328,341,612,313,283]) \u2014 use a recent_N forecast (N=5) to make mu_hat responsive to this new high-demand regime. Use recent_N for sigma_hat (N=5) so the backend captures recent volatility. These choices help the OR engine raise the base stock to cover the elevated short-term demand while reflecting current lead-time variability inferred from concluded arrivals; keeping sigma based on recent observations limits underestimation of safety stock given high recent demand variance.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead-time regime is variable and on average longer-than-promised; recent concluded lead_times = [1,1,3,2,1], mean \u22481.6 (evidence: P3->P4=1, P4->P5=1, P7->P10=3, P29->P31=2, P33->P34=1). Treat variable/longer lead time as sustained until future concludes confirm otherwise.

Period 37 (2019-10-21). Recent concludes show variable/longer-than-promised lead times (observed concluded LT samples \u2248 [1,1,3,2,1], avg\u22481.6). On-hand=0, in-transit=833 (covers multiple future periods). Use estimated lead-time from observed concludes (let backend compute average). Demand forecast/uncertainty: no clear recent demand regime change beyond historical samples provided, so use defaults ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to let OR engine compute base-stock and cap. This balances higher service need from longer/variable lead time while avoiding manual overreaction to noisy demand history.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/4 (Period 39). On-hand=0, in-transit=760. Historical concluded lead_times are variable and on average longer than promised (recent sample mean \u22481.6), with multiple concluded leads: 1,1,3,2,1. To be robust to this sustained, variable longer lead-time regime I set L explicitly to 1.6 so the OR engine plans for extended pipeline. Demand estimate and volatility will use defaults (backend: (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to avoid overfitting short-term spikes; this balances service level (higher L raises base stock to avoid stockouts given long/inconsistent arrivals) versus holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime: variable and on average longer-than-promised; recent concluded lead_times = [1,1,3,2,1], mean \u22481.6. Treat as sustained until future concludes confirm otherwise.

Date 2019/11/11 (Period 40). Recent concludes show variable/longer-than-promised lead times with observed concluded lead_times = [1,1,3,2,1] (mean \u22481.6). On-hand=0, in-transit=760 (large pipeline). Demand has risen recently (periods ~35-38 high). To reflect the empirically variable lead-time regime use recent lead-time average (N=5). For demand forecast and volatility use recent demand behavior (last 5 periods) so mu_hat and sigma_hat capture the recent elevated demand rather than the long-ago low-demand samples. These parameters bias orders to cover (1+L) periods of near-term demand while leveraging the large in-transit pipeline to avoid over-ordering.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=0, in-transit=760. Historical concluded lead_times show variable, multi-period delays (recent observed lead_times ~ [1,1,3,2,1]); recent demand has been elevated and volatile (last 5 demands: 282,313,385,231,278). To reflect the variable/longer-than-promised lead time regime use recent_N for L (N=5). To capture current high recent demand and volatility use recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std over the recent regime. This balances service level (cover near-term high demand) against holding cost given large in-transit balance.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=43, in-transit=472. Historical concluded lead times show variability and are on average longer than the promised 2?periods; observed concluded lead_times = [1,1,3,2,1,3,1,3], mean\u22481.875. Pipeline is large (472) but arrivals have been variable; to let OR backend internal formulas account for realized variability, set L to be calculated from observed concluded lead times so backend uses average realized lead time. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend applies (1+L)*mean(demands) and sqrt(1+L)*std(demands) consistent with chosen L. This balances service (by increasing expected lead coverage) against holding cost given already substantial in-transit inventory.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime remains variable and on average longer-than-promised; observed concluded lead_times = [1,1,3,2,1,3,1,3], mean\u22481.875. Treat variable/longer lead time as sustained until future concludes confirm otherwise.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019/12/02). Recent demand has spiked (notably Period 42 demand=733) and history shows variable/longer-than-promised lead times with multiple concluded lead_times (e.g. 1,1,3,2,1,3,1,3). On-hand=0, in-transit=472 (some prior shipments outstanding). I choose L via "calculate" to let the backend use observed concluded lead times average (captures variable/longer regime). For demand I pick recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to weight the last 5 demand samples and reflect the recent high-demand regime and elevated variability, so the OR engine raises base-stock while controlling holding cost given high uncertainty and pipeline inventory.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:

Several late/overdue shipments occurred earlier and demand recently spiked (e.g., 733 on 2019/11/25). To hedge variable/longer lead time, set L to the average of observed concluded lead times (use calculate). Use an EWMA forecast for mu_hat (gamma=0.3) to weight recent high demand more while retaining historical signal. Keep sigma_hat as default to let backend scale volatility over (1+L). These choices increase pipeline cover for longer/variable lead times and raise target base-stock to protect service during recent demand surge while relying on backend caps to limit over-ordering.

On-hand=0, in-transit=877 (large pipeline). To reflect the empirical variable/longer lead-time regime, set L to be computed from observed concluded lead times. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples; given large pipeline this avoids over-ordering while letting backend target the optimal service quantile.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/23 (Period 46). On-hand=0, in-transit=877. History shows variable/longer-than-promised lead times (multiple concluded lead_times; average >1). To capture realized lead-time variability use lead-time inference from concluded history. Set L by 'calculate' to let backend average observed lead times. Demand has recent volatility and large sporadic spikes late in year; use a short recent window for demand forecast (recent_N, N=5) to reflect latest regime. Keep sigma estimation conservative using default (all-sample std scaled by sqrt(1+L)). These choices increase pipeline cover for longer actual lead times while keeping variability reflected for service-level sizing.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date=2019/12/30 (Period 47). On-hand=277, in-transit=472. Historical concluded lead_times show recent variability with multiple 3-period arrivals (recent concluded lead_times ~ [3,3,3,1,2,1,1,3]) \u2014 recent behavior skews longer than the promised 2. Demand has been volatile with a very large spike (Period 42=733) followed by mixed weekly demand. To protect service given uncertain/longer actual lead-times, I set L using recent lead-time observations (captures current longer/variable regime). For demand forecast I use the most recent 5 weeks to reflect the recent spike and subsequent recovery; sigma uses the same window to capture recent volatility. These choices increase pipeline cover for longer lead times while letting the OR backend compute safety stock with the updated demand mean/variance.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime remains variable and on average longer-than-promised; recent concluded lead_times include multiple 3-period arrivals and the recent average \u22482.1 \u2014 treat variable/longer lead time as sustained until future concludes confirm otherwise.
