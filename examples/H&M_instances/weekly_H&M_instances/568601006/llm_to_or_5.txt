Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11 (early-February). Product is a women's blazer \u2014 no obvious calendar spike now. No on-hand or in-transit inventory and no concluded arrivals to infer lead time or lost shipments. Historical demand samples = [161,145,179,196,186] show stable demand (mean ~173.4, std ~18.23). Use promised lead time (default L=0). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat to defaults (covering review+lead period = 1 period) so the OR backend's base-stock reflects historical mean and variability while avoiding unnecessary inventory given holding cost = $1 vs profit = $2.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Product is a womens blazer\u2014no obvious calendar spike this week. Historical sample mean = 173.4 but Period 1 conclude showed demand=227 (higher-than-historical), suggesting a recent uptick. Observed lead time from Period 1 conclude = 0 periods (ordered and arrived same period); no evidence of delays or lost shipments. I therefore set L using the calculated (observed) lead time=0. For demand I place more weight on the recent higher requests: I use recent_N with N=3 (the most recent three demand observations including the Period 1 conclude) to capture the uptick while avoiding overreacting to a single outlier. mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(recent 3) -> 203.0 units. sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(recent 3) -> 17.46 units. These parameters raise the base-stock to cover the near-term elevated demand while L=0 keeps arrivals same-period, limiting excess pipeline and holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Recent demand uptick: Period 1 demand=227 vs historical mean 173.4; adopt short-term regime (recent_N=3) until further evidence.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Product: Mariette Blazer. Observed concluded lead times: Period1 lead_time=0, Period2 lead_time=0 \u2192 stable same-period arrivals. Recent demand shows an uptick (latest demands = 186, 227, 284) so adopt a short-term regime. Choose L by averaging observed lead times to reflect actual same-period arrivals. For demand, use recent_N=3 to capture the higher recent mean; mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last3) = 232.333 units. Volatility estimated from the same recent window: sample std \u2248 49.22, sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std = 49.22. These parameters raise the base stock to cover the recent demand spike while keeping holding exposure limited because lead time is 0.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent concluded history shows all prior orders arrived with lead_time=0 (Periods 1\u20133), so use promised lead time. Demand has shifted up recently (Periods 1\u20133 = 227, 284, 198) vs older samples; adopt a short-term regime using the most recent 3 periods to capture the uptick. L=0 keeps orders arriving same period. mu_hat uses recent_N=3 to raise the base-stock to match the new mean demand (mean=236.333). sigma_hat uses recent_N=3 to reflect elevated short-term volatility (std\u224843.75). These parameters raise the target inventory to improve service during the upswing while keeping holding cost moderate by limiting horizon to recent data.

Daily Reward (R_t): $386.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. Observed concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 in all past periods (orders on Periods 1\u20134 arrived same period). On-hand=42, in-transit=0 so available stock is low vs recent demand. Historical baseline earlier showed lower mean, but recent uptick persists (carry-over recommended recent_N=3). I set L to promised/default 0 because concluded messages consistently show 0. I set mu_hat using recent_N=3 (most recent demands Periods 2\u20134 = [284,198,214], mean=232) to capture the elevated short-term demand; this gives mu_hat=(1+L)*mean=232. I set sigma_hat using recent_N=3 (sample std \u224845.74, scaled by sqrt(1+L)=1) to reflect recent volatility. These parameters raise the base-stock to cover the higher short-run demand while keeping holding exposure limited given observed zero lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $393.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent data (Periods 1-5 demands = 227, 284, 198, 214, 215) show a sustained upward regime vs the older baseline (mean 173.4). All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0. I therefore set L based on observed lead times (average=0). For demand I use a recent_N=5 regime to capture the new higher mean; mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last5)=227.6. Volatility is set from the same recent window: sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(last5)=29.33. These parameters raise the base-stock to match the higher on-going demand while keeping lead-time at the observed same-period level, balancing service and holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

Carry-over insight: Recent sustained demand uptick starting Period 1; last 5-period mean=227.6 (use recent_N=5 regime).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (early spring). Recent sales show a sustained uptick vs earlier baseline; concluded history shows lead_time=0 each period so keep promised L=0. On-hand=27, in-transit=0 \u2014 low vs recent demand (~225\u2013228/week), so we should size targets to the recent short-term regime. I use recent_N=5 demand estimate (carry-over insight) to capture the sustained higher demand; volatility estimated from the same recent 5 samples. These parameters make the OR engine set a base-stock to meet ~1 period of elevated demand while keeping holding cost in mind.

Carry-over insight: Recent sustained demand uptick starting Period 1; last 5-period mean=227.6 (use recent_N=5 regime).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 (orders placed previously arrived same period). Recent sustained demand regime persists (last 5-period mean elevated). Use L=average observed lead times=0. For demand, use recent_N=5 regime (captures sustained uplift since Period 1); mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last 5 demands) = 205.6. Volatility set to recent_N=5: sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(last 5 demands) = 11.747 (std of [198,214,215,215,186] \u224811.747). These settings raise the base-stock to reflect the higher recent mean while keeping lead time at observed 0 to avoid unnecessary pipeline inflation and holding cost.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/8. Product is a seasonal womens blazer; recent demand has trended higher since Period 1. All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 historically (no overdue shipments). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, so we must cover current-period demand plus replenish immediately. I use observed lead time average (calculate \u2192 0). Demand regime: recent 5-period mean best represents the sustained uptick (periods 4\u20138 demands = [214,215,215,186,249], mean=215.8). Set mu_hat = (1+L)*recent5_mean to target that demand; set sigma_hat from recent-5 sample std (population) scaled by sqrt(1+L) to reflect observed volatility (~19.97). These parameters raise base-stock to meet higher recent demand while keeping holding cost considered (profit/holding = 2).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15. Recent demand regime persists (higher recent mean vs older base). All concluded lead-times = 0 \u2192 no evidence of transit delays. On-hand=48, in-transit=0; with promised L=0 and no overdue shipments, use L=0. Use recent_N=5 demand estimate to capture the sustained uplift seen in the last 5 periods (Periods 5\u20139 demands = [215,215,186,249,178], mean=208.6, std\u224825.14). This sets mu_hat = (1+L)*recent_mean to cover the review+lead horizon and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*recent_std to reflect current volatility. These parameters bias ordering toward meeting elevated short-term demand while avoiding excessive holding cost given holding=$1 and profit=$2 (service quantile moderate).

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Latest concluded history shows consistent 0-period arrivals (observed LT=0). Recent demand has cooled versus earlier uptick; last 5 concluded-period demands (Periods 6\u201310) average 191.6. On-hand=91, in-transit=0 so we target coverage for current period + lead time (L=0). Set lead time to promised (0), use a recent_N=5 demand estimate to capture the most recent regime, and use overall sample volatility for sigma to let the OR engine size safety stock appropriately given profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29. On-hand=82, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead_time=0 each period (orders from Periods 1\u201311 all arrived with lead_time=0). Demand last 11 periods mean=202.09 but a recent regime change: last 5-period demands [186,249,178,130,127] have mean=174 and lower dispersion. I set L=default (promised 0) because concluded history consistently shows 0. I set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the recent lower-demand regime (1+L)*mean_last5 = 174 units for the review+lead period. I set sigma_hat using recent_N=5 (population std) = 44.57 to reflect recent volatility. These choices reduce ordering to match the recent downturn and avoid excess holding cost while preserving service given on-hand=82 and no pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Recent demand downturn: last 5-period mean=174 (Periods 7\u201311: 186,249,178,130,127) vs prior 11-period mean=202.09; adopt recent_N=5 regime for demand until contradicted.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/6. History shows concluded lead times = 0 for all past orders (no delays); on-hand=5, in-transit=0. Recent demand has softened vs earlier uptick \u2014 last 5 demands (Periods 8\u201312): [249,178,130,127,191], mean=175 and sample volatility ~44.88. I set L to the average observed lead time (0). I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent downturn regime (protect against over-ordering after earlier high-demand periods) so the OR engine's base-stock will reflect the lower recent mean while preserving adequate safety stock via sigma_hat.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-05-13. All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 historically (orders in Periods 1\u201313 all arrived same period). Recent demand shows a downturn versus earlier uptick: last 5 demands (Periods 9\u201313 = 178,130,127,191,160) mean=157.2, std(sample)=28.45. On-hand=37, in-transit=0. I set L using recent observed lead times (average=0) to reflect reliable same-period fulfillment. For demand I use recent_N=5 to capture the recent lower-demand regime (reduces target base-stock and holding costs). mu_hat = (1+L)*recent_mean = 157.2. sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*recent_std = 28.45. These choices lower order targets to avoid excess holding cost while preserving service given current lower demand and zero lead time.

Carry-over insight: Recent demand downturn: last 5-period mean=157.2 (Periods 9\u201313: 178,130,127,191,160); adopt recent_N=5 regime for demand until contradicted.

Promised lead time has consistently concluded as 0 in history, so keep L=default (0). mu_hat set as (1+L)*mean of last 5 = 160.8 to reflect the recent lower demand; sigma_hat set as sqrt(1+L)*std of last 5 = 29.13 to capture recent volatility. These parameters lower target base-stock vs earlier high-demand regime, reducing holding cost while preserving service for the observed recent demand level.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27. Historical concludes show consistent actual lead_time=0 (all concluded arrivals report lead_time 0). Recent demand regime: downturn identified in prior carry-over (Periods 11\u201315) \u2014 last 5-period demand = [127,191,160,196,143], mean=163.4. On-hand=32, in-transit=0 so current available << expected one-period demand (~163). I set L=default (promised 0) because concluded history consistently shows 0. I use recent_N=5 for demand (mu_hat) and sigma_hat to capture the recent downturn regime rather than longer-term higher means; mu_hat = (1+L)*recent_mean = 163.4 to target service while limiting overstock. sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std_recent = 26.75 (std of last 5). This balances service (covers current lower-demand regime) against holding cost, and signals the OR engine to order toward the reduced base-stock implied by the downturn.

Carry-over insight: Recent demand downturn persists: last 5-period mean=163.4 (Periods 11\u201315: 127,191,160,196,143); adopt recent_N=5 downturn regime for demand.

Carry-over insight indicates a recent downturn regime; continue recent_N=5 demand estimate using the last 5 demands (Periods 12\u201316: 191,160,196,143,168). Mean demand (last 5) = 171.6 -> set mu_hat = (1+L)*mean = 171.6. Sample std (last 5) = 22.01 -> sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std = 22.01. These parameters keep L=0 (no pipeline delay), reduce target base-stock to match the recent lower demand regime and lower safety stock reflecting observed volatility, balancing service level vs holding cost.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/17 (Period 19). Historical concludes show consistent same-day arrivals (observed lead_time=0 each concluded order), so use observed-average lead time=0. Recent demand regime shows a downturn adopted earlier; I use recent_N=5 (most recent demands Periods 14\u201318 = [196,143,168,118,139]) to capture the current lower mean and volatility. This yields mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_recent = 152.8 units (covers review+lead period) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std_recent \u2248 30.0. These parameters keep target base-stock responsive to the downturn (reducing overstock risk) while retaining enough safety stock for variability. No in-transit units visible; on-hand=31 will be considered by OR when computing order quantity.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=0 (all concluded orders had W=0). Recent demand (Periods 15\u201319: 143,168,118,139,122) is lower than the longer-run mean, so I prefer conservative defaults that reflect stable 0 lead time and use all available demand history for variability. Set L to promised/default 0 (supported by all concluded messages). Use default mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all 19 observed demands) = 182.105263. Use default sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all 19 observed demands) = 44.82 (std computed from the 19 concluded demand samples). These parameters give the OR engine an up-to-date mean and measured volatility while relying on observed reliable same-period lead time, balancing service level (via mean+safety stock) against holding cost given modest holding penalty.

Carry-over insight: New recent downturn: Periods 15\u201319 demand mean=138.0 (143,168,118,139,122) \u2014 lower than prior regime; consider continued low-demand regime unless contradicted.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:

Carry-over analysis (Periods 15\u201319) shows a lower-demand regime (mean=138.0); I adopt that recent_N=5 regime to avoid overstock. Set L=promised (0) because concluded history shows consistent 0 lead time. mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N=5 (Periods 15\u201319 demands: 143,168,118,139,122) so mu_hat=(1+L)*mean=138.0 and sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std\u224819.888.

Carry-over insight: New low-demand regime: Periods 17\u201321 mean=113.6 (118,139,122,73,116); adopt recent_N=5 low-demand regime.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-15. All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 historically (no missed shipments). Recent demand regime remains the low-demand regime identified in carry-over: Periods 17\u201321 demands = [118,139,122,73,116], mean=113.6. On-hand=5, in-transit=0 \u2014 low buffer vs. low expected demand. I set L by averaging observed lead times (calculate) => 0. For demand I use recent_N=5 to capture the persistent low-demand regime: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last5)=113.6. For volatility I use recent_N=5 sample std to reflect actual recent variability (sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(last5) \u2248 24.45). These parameters reduce ordering exposure while maintaining service given the sustained lower demand and zero observed lead time.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/22. Product is seasonal womens blazer; recent history shows a sustained low-demand regime. On-hand=5, in-transit=0 so no incoming arrivals expected. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 every period (orders arrive same period). Carry-over insights indicate a low-demand regime (Periods 19\u201323 demand mean ~110.2). I set L to promised/default (0) because concluded arrivals confirm 0 lead time. For demand I use recent_N=5 to capture the current low-demand regime (last 5 demands = [122,73,116,120,120], mean=110.2). Volatility uses recent_N=5 sample std \u224820.92. These parameters lower the base-stock to reduce overstock/holding costs while preserving service given the observed lower demand.

Carry-over insight: New sustained low-demand regime: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 19\u201323) mean=110.2, std\u224820.92; adopt recent_N=5 low-demand regime.

On-hand=57, in-transit=0 \u2014 no incoming stock visible. To minimize holding cost while matching the low-demand environment, set lead time=promised (0) and use recent_N=5 demand estimates so OR backend targets inventory appropriate for the sustained low-demand regime.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/5. Product is a seasonal women's blazer; recent history shows a sustained low-demand regime. All concluded lead-times are 0 (every past order arrived same period). Recent 5-period demands (Periods 21\u201325 = 116,120,120,63,94) have mean=102.6 and std\u224822.03, so I use a recent_N=5 demand estimate. On-hand=17, in-transit=0 \u2192 inventory is well below one-period expected demand, so parameters aim to satisfy next-period demand while reflecting lower volatility to avoid excess holding cost.

On-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so we must cover one period of demand (L+1=1). Observed concluded lead times are consistently 0, so keep L=0 (promised).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26 (Period 29). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded demands (Periods 24\u201328) = [63,94,146,301,251] show two very large recent spikes (301,251) that reverse prior low-demand regimes; last-5 mean=171.0 and std\u224884.28. All prior arrivals show actual lead_time=0 historically. I therefore set lead time to promised (0) and switch to a recent_N=5 demand regime to capture the latest volatility and elevated tail risk. This increases mu_hat to cover the review+lead period demand typical over the most recent regime while sigma_hat reflects the higher variance from the recent spikes, improving service for potential high-demand weeks while acknowledging holding cost via the OR cap.

Carry-over insight: New short-term uptick: recent demands include two large spikes (Periods 27\u201328: 301,251); adopt recent_N=5 regime (Periods24\u201328 mean=171.0, std\u224884.28).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02. All concluded history shows lead_time=0 consistently; recent data shows a short-term demand uptick (Periods 25\u201329: 94,146,301,251,231). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish to cover next-period demand. I set L=default (promised 0) because concluded lead times are 0. For demand I adopt a recent_N=5 regime to capture the latest uptick: mean(Periods25-29)=204.6 units (this is (1+L)\xd7sample mean since L=0). Volatility estimated from the same 5-sample window: sample std \u224883.41 (sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). These parameters raise the base-stock to respond to the recent spike while reflecting high variance to avoid frequent stockouts.

Carry-over insight: New short-term uptick: Periods 25\u201329 mean=204.6, std\u224883.41; adopt recent_N=5 uptick regime.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-09 (Period 31). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent demand has strongly increased: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 26\u201330 = 146,301,251,231,357) show mean=257.2 and std\u224879.0. Historical lead-time observations consistently show lead_time=0. I adopt a recent_N=5 demand regime to capture the current uptick so the OR engine raises the base-stock; keep L at promised (default=0) because all concluded messages show 0-period lead time. This balances higher service level to capture the spike while accepting higher holding cost risk given zero pipeline.

Carry-over insight: New sustained high-demand regime starting Period 26: last 5-period mean=257.2, std\u224879.0; adopt recent_N=5 uptick regime.

On-hand=0, in-transit=0, and historical concluded lead-times are 0 each period so use promised lead time. To support service during this high-demand regime while avoiding excess holding, I use a recent_N=5 demand estimate (captures current spike) and keep L=0 (observed consistently). These parameters give the OR backend a higher base-stock reflecting the elevated mean while using the recent volatility for safety.

All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 historically. Set L=0 (promised/observed). Use recent_N=5 for demand forecasting to capture the current high regime: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last5)=301.6. Sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*sample_std(last5)=56.72. These parameters raise the base-stock to meet the spike in demand while reflecting observed variability, balancing service level vs holding cost.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019/9/30. All concluded arrivals show actual lead_time=0 repeatedly; no overdue/lost shipments. Recent demand has entered a strong high regime: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 29\u201333) = [231,357,328,341,612], mean=369.8, sd\u2248142. I set L to promised (default 0). I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the new high-demand regime (mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_last5 = 369.8). sigma_hat uses recent_N=5 (sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std_last5 \u2248 142.0) so the OR backend raises base-stock and safety stock to satisfy elevated demand while balancing holding cost.

Carry-over insight: New sustained high-demand regime confirmed: Periods 29\u201333 mean=369.8, sd\u2248142 (use recent_N=5 uptick regime).

All historical conclude messages show lead_time=0 consistently, so use promised lead time. On-hand=122, in-transit=0 \u2014 little pipeline, so set forecast using recent_N=5 to capture the sustained uptick and higher variance so OR backend raises base-stock to avoid stockouts during this high-demand phase.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/10/14 (Period 36). Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 31\u201335 = 328, 341, 612, 313, 283) average 375.4 with high volatility. All concluded lead_times = 0, so use promised lead time. On-hand=162, in-transit=0 \u2014 well below one-period (L+1) demand under the new regime (\u2248375.4), so we must raise the base-stock forecast to avoid stockouts. Set L = default (promised 0). Use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the detected regime (captures the recent spike including the 612 outlier). This increases service level while accepting higher holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Carry-over insight: New sustained high-demand regime starting Period 31: Periods 31\u201335 mean=375.4, std\u2248131.2; adopt recent_N=5 uptick regime.

LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-10-21. Recent data show a sustained high-demand regime since Period 31: last 5 demands (Periods 32\u201336) = [341,612,313,283,282], mean=366.2, sd\u2248124.8. On-hand=152, in-transit=0. All concluded orders historically had lead_time=0, so keep L=promised (0). To balance service level vs holding cost, set demand forecast and volatility using recent_N=5 so the OR engine raises the base-stock to cover the elevated short-term demand while avoiding excess over long horizon.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent history (Periods 34\u201338 demands = [313,283,282,313,385]) shows a sustained high-demand regime; last-5 mean=315.2, sd\u224841.9. All concluded lead-time observations remain 0 periods (no delay evidence). I set L to promised default (0). For demand I use recent_N=5 to capture the current regime: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_last5 = 315.2. sigma_hat uses recent_N=5 sample std scaled by sqrt(1+L) = 41.89. These parameters raise the base-stock to meet the current high demand while keeping volatility grounded to avoid excessive inventory holding given holding cost=$1/unit.

Carry-over insight: Recent sustained high-demand regime persists: Periods 34\u201338 mean=315.2, std\u224841.9 (use recent_N=5 uptick regime).

On-hand=103, in-transit=0 so pipeline is empty while one-period demand likely ~299, so we should target the recent_N=5 demand regime. Lead time: promised=0 and all concluded arrivals confirm 0 historically, so use default promised L=0. mu_hat: use recent_N=5 to capture the current high-demand regime; (1+L)*mean(last 5)=1*298.8. sigma_hat: use recent_N=5 sample std to capture current volatility \u224856.5. These settings raise the base-stock to meet elevated demand while sigma accounts for observed variability; with profit=2 and holding=1, the backend will compute an appropriate z and cap, balancing service level vs holding costs. Given on-hand=103 and no in-transit, this forecast signals a substantial order to avoid stockouts under the current high-demand regime.

All concluded orders show lead_time=0 historically.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 and all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 historically. Recent demand shows a strong uptick including Period 42 spike (d=733). I use a recent_N=5 demand regime (Periods 38\u201342: 385,231,278,245,733) to capture the current high-demand level. L set to promised (0) because all concluded lead times = 0. mu_hat set to the 5-period mean (1+L)*mean = 374.4 to target service during this high regime. sigma_hat set to the 5-period std \u2248 186.21 to reflect elevated volatility from the Period 42 spike. These parameters increase base-stock to reduce lost sales given zero pipeline and recent severe stockouts while accepting higher holding risk.

Carry-over insight: Recent uptick intensified by Period 42 spike: Periods 38\u201342 mean=374.4, std\u2248186.2; adopt recent_N=5 high-demand regime.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/9 (Period 44). Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime (multiple recent spikes including Period 42=733). On-hand=296, in-transit=0 so we already hold substantial stock but no pipeline. All concluded lead-times have been 0 historically. To capture the recent uptick and avoid stockouts during this high regime I set lead time = promised (0) and forecast demand using the most recent 5 concluded demands (Periods 39\u201343 = [231,278,245,733,169]) giving a 5-period mean of 331.2. Volatility is estimated from the same 5 samples (population std \u2248 204.0). These parameters raise the base-stock to reflect the elevated recent demand while keeping L=0 consistent with concluded lead-times; this balances higher service-level need (avoid lost sales) against holding cost given current on-hand inventory of 296.

Carry-over insight: New sustained high-demand regime confirmed: Periods 39\u201343 mean=331.2, std\u2248204.0; adopt recent_N=5 high-demand regime.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/16 (Period 45). On-hand=126, in-transit=0. All concluded arrivals show actual lead_time=0 historically, so keep L=promised (0). Recent demand has entered a high-demand regime: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 40\u201344 = 278,245,733,169,304) mean=345.8, sd\u2248198.8. I set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the current elevated demand (mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_recent = 345.8). sigma_hat uses recent_N=5 (sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*sd_recent = 198.84) to reflect high volatility. These parameters bias the OR engine toward higher base stock to avoid stockouts during the current spike while accounting for large demand variance.

Carry-over insight: New sustained high-demand regime confirmed: Periods 40\u201344 mean=345.8, sd\u2248198.8; use recent_N=5 uptick regime.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/23 (Period 46). Recent sustained high-demand regime persists (last 5 concluded demands Periods 41\u201345 = [245,733,169,304,258], mean=341.8, sd\u2248224.06). No evidence of lost shipments (in-transit=0, arrivals historically immediate). Use promised lead time (0) and a recent_N=5 demand estimate to capture the current high-demand regime while keeping safety stock reflecting high volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-55.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30. All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 consistently (Periods 1\u201346), so use promised/default L=0. On-hand=311, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Recent demand regime: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 42\u201346 = 733,169,304,258,128) have mean=318.4 and high volatility (std\u2248216.6) \u2014 this captures the large spike at Period 42 plus varied weekly demand. I set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to reflect the current post-spike demand level and set sigma_hat from the same 5-sample window to capture increased uncertainty. These choices raise the base-stock to protect service during elevated/volatile demand while acknowledging holding cost via the OR engine's q tradeoff.
