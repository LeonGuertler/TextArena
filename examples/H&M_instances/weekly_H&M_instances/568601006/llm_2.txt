  "rationale": "a) World knowledge & product: Date is 2019-02-11 (just before Valentine's Day). The SKU is a women's fitted blazer (dressed/tailoring). Blazers are non-perishable fashion items that sell steadily and can get a small pre-Spring uplift in late winter; Valentine's Day may slightly boost women's dressy apparel demand but impact is modest. b) Demand regime: Historical unified samples for this SKU: [161,145,179,196,186] \u2192 mean \u2248 173 units/period, moderate variability but no sign of recent regime shift. Use 173 as baseline per-period demand. c) Lead-time & missing orders: Supplier promised lead time = 4 periods. No concluded arrivals seen yet (Period 0 none), so actual lead time is unknown; cannot assume arrivals sooner or that orders are lost. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand = 0, In-transit = 0. Given lead time uncertainty and the instruction to cover (L+1) periods of demand (current period plus L future periods), plan to cover 5 periods of expected demand. e) Final order logic: Order quantity = forecast_per_period (173) \xd7 (L+1 = 5) = 865 units. This aims to meet expected demand during the full pipeline window while keeping safety implicit in using historical mean. Monitor future conclude messages to infer actual lead time and adjust subsequent orders.",
