In-transit = 1370 equals orders: P42=382 (arrive P46), P43=508 (P47), P44=400 (P48), P45=80 (P49). These arrivals will satisfy periods P46\u2013P49 (note arrivals occur before demand within those periods). Decision requirement: must cover (L+1)=5 periods (P46\u2013P50) of demand. Forecast: assume elevated holiday demand ~350 units/period (conservative vs recent mean 285 and observed spikes). Required coverage \u2248 350\xd75 = 1750 units. Pipeline covers 1370 \u2192 shortfall \u2248 380 units. Order placed now (arrives in P50) will cover period P50. Considering profit vs holding cost and holiday service-level priority, round shortfall up to 400 units to provide buffer.",

{
  "rationale": "World & calendar: Period 47 is 2019-12-30 (week between Christmas and New Year). No clear holiday-driven uplift for womens blazers beyond the single large promo spike (P42 demand=733) which is isolated. Demand regime: recent 8-period demand (P39\u2013P46) = [231,278,245,733,169,304,137,128], mean \u2248278 but heavily skewed by one large outlier (P42). Median/typical recent demand excluding the outlier \u2248245. Historical carry-over regimes (declines in P18\u2013P25 and spike P27\u2013P33) already recorded. Lead time & arrivals: concluded history shows consistent actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple confirmed arrivals). Inventory & pipeline: on-hand = 254, in-transit = 1388, total pipeline = 1642 units. Coverage need: with L+1 = 5 periods coverage, even using a conservative forecast ~245\u2013278 units/period \u2192 5-period demand \u22481,225\u20131,390 units. Current pipeline (1,642) comfortably covers this. Risk: holding cost = $1/unit/period; avoid excess inventory given no sustained demand increase. Action: place no new order this period.",
