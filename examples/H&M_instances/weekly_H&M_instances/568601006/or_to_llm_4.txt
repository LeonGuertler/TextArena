Demand outlook: recent 3-period demands = [169,304,258], short-term mean \u2248244 units; longer-run mean ~202 but recent regime elevated. OR recommends 206 (uses long-run stats and promised L).

{
  "rationale": "Observed facts: sustained actual lead_time=0 (every concluded period through P46 shows arrived same period). On-hand=118, in-transit=0. OR cap-based recommendation=158 (uses promised L and historical sample). Recent demand is volatile: last 4 demands = [169,304,258,128] (mean\u2248215) and longer recent spike months showed much higher peaks (~300+). With lead_time=0 our order arrives this period and contributes to meeting Period 47 demand. Strategy: modestly increase OR's 158 to provide a small buffer against upside demand while avoiding excessive holding cost given profit= $2 and holding=$1. Ordering 170 yields available inventory \u2248288 this period (118 on-hand + 170 ordered), balancing risk of stockout if demand is above OR's implicit target and limiting holding cost if demand is low. Final action: order 170 units.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Ordered 170 (vs OR 158) because lead_time=0 so orders cover this period; small increase provides a buffer for recent demand volatility (last 4 mean\u2248215) while limiting holding cost.",
