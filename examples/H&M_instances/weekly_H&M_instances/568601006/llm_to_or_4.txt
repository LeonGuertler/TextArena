Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Product is a seasonal womens blazer; no on-hand or in-transit stock and no concluded arrivals to infer lead time. Historical demand samples = [161,145,179,196,186] (mean=173.4, std\u224820.38). No evidence of changepoint or lost shipments. Use promised lead time (0) and default demand estimators to let the OR engine compute base stock from the established demand statistics while avoiding speculative adjustments.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Product is seasonal apparel (blazer) around late winter\u2014no calendar spikes immediate. Period 1 conclude shows the order placed in Period 1 arrived with lead_time=0 and emptied stock; on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical demands = [161,145,179,196,186] -> mean=173.4, std\u224818.238. No evidence of regime change in demand or delayed shipments. Therefore use observed lead time average (L=0) and default demand aggregation: mu_hat=(1+L)*mean historical, sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std historical to let OR backend compute base-stock while keeping holding costs moderate given modest profit margin ($2 vs $1).

Carry-over insight: Observed sustained lead_time=0 (Period 1 conclude: arrived 183, lead_time 0); historical demand mean \u2248173.4, std \u224818.24.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-02-25. History shows two consecutive same-period arrivals (lead_time observed = 0) and strong uptick in realized demand (Period1 demand=227, Period2 demand=284) compared with historical mean \u2248173.4. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish for elevated recent demand. I set L based on the average of observed lead times (both 0 \u2192 L=0). I detect a recent upward demand regime; I use recent_N=3 (last 3 demand samples: 186, 227, 284) to forecast the review+lead demand, giving mu_hat=(1+L)*mean_recent \u2248232.33. Volatility is set as recent_N std scaled by sqrt(1+L): sigma_hat \u224849.22. These parameters raise the base-stock to cover the new high-demand regime while keeping holding cost in mind given holding/profit ratio.

Carry-over insight: Recent demand regime shift upward: last-period demands 227 and 284 vs prior historical mean ~173.4; treat as sustained until contradicted.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent concluded periods show same-period arrivals (lead_time=0) and a sustained upward demand regime: recent demands [227, 284, 198] exceed prior historical mean. On-hand=56, in-transit=0. I set L=0 (observed average lead time=0). For demand I use recent_N (N=3) to capture the new higher demand regime: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last 3) = 236.333...; sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(last 3) = 43.75. These parameters raise the base-stock to satisfy the new demand level while keeping holding exposure proportional to observed variability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $386.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 (Periods 1-4 conclude), so use observed lead time=0. Recent demand has shifted up vs historical base: last 4 realized demands = [227,284,198,214], mean=230.75, std\u224837.43; evidence: sold-out early in Periods 1-2 and elevated sales in Periods 2-4. On-hand=42, in-transit=0; with L=0 we must cover current-period demand only. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the recent 4-period regime to capture the upward shift and elevated volatility so the OR backend raises the base-stock to improve service while capping orders via its cap parameter to limit excess inventory.

Carry-over insight: Recent sustained demand regime upward: last 4 demands mean=230.75, std\u224837.43 (Periods 1-4 concluded); sustained until contradicted.

Daily Reward (R_t): $398.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-03-18. Historical concludes show actual lead_time=0 consistently (arrivals in Periods 1-5 all had lead_time 0). Recent demand regime is higher: last 4 concluded demands (Periods 2-5) have mean=230.75 and std\u224837.43. On-hand=32, in-transit=0 so without ordering we'll stockout given expected next-period demand ~231. I set L to the observed average lead time (0). I use recent_N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained upward demand regime (N=4 is the length of the recent regime). mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_recent = 230.75 to cover the review+lead period demand; sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std_recent = 37.43 to reflect elevated volatility. These parameters signal the OR engine to replenish toward the higher recent demand while L=0 keeps arrivals same-period as historically observed.

Carry-over insight: Sustained upward demand regime: last 4 concluded demands (Periods 2-5) mean=230.75, std=37.43; treat as sustained until contradicted.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25. All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 (Periods 1-6), on-hand=30, in-transit=0. Recent demand has moderated versus the early spike: last 4 concluded demands (Periods 3-6) = [198,214,215,215], mean=210.5, sample std\u22488.35. I set L by averaging observed lead times (calculate) \u2192 0. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the most recent regime (N=4 captures the last similar-period demands). mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_recent = 210.5 to reflect current demand level and avoid overstocking from earlier extreme spikes. sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*sample_std_recent \u2248 8.35 to reflect currently low volatility. These parameters bias the OR base-stock toward meeting the current elevated-but-stable demand while limiting holding cost given holding=$1 vs profit=$2 (service quantile moderate).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. On-hand=29, in-transit=0; no overdue arrivals. Prior carry-over indicated an elevated regime (mean=230.75) but the most recent 4 concluded demands (Periods 4-7 = 214,215,215,186) show a downward shift: mean=207.5, std\u224814.344. I treat this as a new regime and use recent_N=4 to capture current demand; observed lead times all concluded = 0 so keep L=0. These parameters reduce stock relative to the prior higher-plan while covering expected next-period demand.

Carry-over insight: Updated sustained demand regime: last 4 concluded demands (Periods 4-7) mean=207.5, std=14.344; treat as sustained until contradicted.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/8. All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 consistently; on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent demand shows a regime shift: Period 8 demand=249 higher than the prior 4-period regime, so I use the most recent 4 concluded demands (Periods 5-8) to capture the current level and volatility. Set L to the average observed lead time (0). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4) so OR base-stock reflects the elevated recent mean while keeping volatility estimate based on the same window.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-04-15. All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 consistently; on-hand=50, in-transit=0. Recent demand regime shifted vs early history: last 4 concluded demands (Periods 6-9) = [215,186,249,178] => mean 207.0, std ~27.884. I set L using the average of observed lead times (0). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the current regime quickly; mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_recent = 207.0 to size the base stock to recent demand, and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std_recent = 27.884 to reflect observed volatility. This balances service (higher mu_hat because recent demands are above original long-run mean) with holding cost by using only the recent 4-sample regime rather than the full history.

Carry-over insight: Updated sustained demand regime: last 4 concluded demands (Periods 6-9) mean=207.0, std=27.884 (evidence: demands 215,186,249,178).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22. Historical concludes show consistent same-period arrivals (observed lead_time=0 in all concluded orders), so use L=0. Recent demand regime (Periods 6-9) shows a sustained elevated mean; last 4 concluded demands mean=207.0, std\u224827.884 (evidence: demands 215,186,249,178). To match the current regime and keep service while limiting holding, set mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) and sigma_hat from the same window. This yields base-stock reflecting current demand and low lead time, balancing profit vs holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

Daily Reward (R_t): $174.00

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Observed concluded lead_times are consistently 0 (all conclude messages show arrived units with lead_time 0). Recent demand has dropped: last 4 concluded demands (Periods 8-11 = 249,178,130,127) average 171.0 with elevated volatility. On-hand=80, in-transit=0 so orders will arrive same period (L=0). I set L to the average observed lead time (0). I forecast demand across the review+lead period using recent_N (N=4) to capture the apparent downward regime; mu_hat = 171.0. Volatility uses the same recent window: sigma_hat = 49.37. These choices keep the base-stock responsive to the recent lower demand while reflecting increased variance to avoid stockouts given current on-hand is modest.

Carry-over insight: Updated sustained demand regime: last 4 concluded demands (Periods 8-11) mean=171.0, std\u224849.37; treat as sustained until contradicted.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/6 (Period 13). Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (all concluded orders show lead_time=0). Recent demand regime (Periods 8-11) has mean=171.0 and std\u224849.37; Period 12 demand (191) left ending on-hand=5 and no in-transit units, so immediate replenishment needed to cover upcoming period demand. I therefore set L based on observed lead times (average=0). For demand I use the recent_N=4 regime (Periods 8-11) which best captures the current lower-demand regime; mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_recent = 171.0. Sigma_hat uses the recent 4-sample std scaled by sqrt(1+L) \u2192 49.37. These parameters keep target base-stock aligned with the recent regime to balance service (avoid lost sales) against holding cost given slim on-hand inventory.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019/5/13. Historical concludes show every order has arrived with lead_time=0 (consistent recent history). Recent demand has softened: last 4 concluded demands (Periods 10\u201313 = 130,127,191,160) have mean 152 and std ~29.97. I set L using the observed average lead time (0). I set mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the newest regime (1+L times mean of last 4 = 152) so the base-stock target reflects the softened demand. I set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4) to reflect reduced volatility (std \u224829.97) so safety stock is calibrated to current variability. This keeps service while limiting holding given on-hand=11 and no in-transit units.

Carry-over insight: New sustained demand regime: last 4 concluded demands (Periods 10\u201313) mean=152, std\u224829.97 (evidence: demands 130,127,191,160).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/20. All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 consistently. On-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so we must replenish to cover latest observed demand regime. Recent changepoint: Periods 10\u201313 show a lower sustained regime (mean=152, std\u224829.97) per carry-over; Period 14 had demand=196 but is treated as an outlier vs the 10\u201313 regime. I set L using the observed average lead time=0. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 (periods 10\u201313) to capture the sustained lower-demand regime while avoiding overreacting to the single high demand in Period 14. This yields moderate target base-stock to balance service (profit $2) vs holding cost $1 by keeping safety stock proportional to observed volatility (\u03c3\u224829.97).

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand regime (Periods 10\u201313): mean=152, std\u224829.97 (evidence: demands 130,127,191,160); treat as current until contradicted.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Observed lead times in concluded history are consistently 0. Recent demand has shifted vs earlier regime; using the last 4 concluded demands (Periods 12\u201315 = [191,160,196,143]) captures the current run. On-hand=40, in-transit=0 so we must replenish to cover (1+L) periods using the recent regime to avoid stockouts while limiting holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Updated sustained demand regime: last 4 concluded demands (Periods 12\u201315) mean=172.5, std\u224821.93; prior insight (mean=152) contradicted by recent data.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/3 (Period 17). All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 consistently (no missing shipments). On-hand=16, in-transit=0 so we must replenish for current-period demand plus safety. Recent demand regime: use the most recent 4 concluded demands (Periods 13\u201316: 160,196,143,168) which show mean=166.75 and sample std\u224822.11; this captures the latest shift versus older windows. Set L by averaging observed lead times (consistent 0). Use recent_N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets the current regime and avoids overstock from older high-demand spikes.

Carry-over insight: Updated sustained demand regime (Periods 13\u201316): mean=166.75, std\u224822.11 (evidence: demands 160,196,143,168).

On-hand=74, in-transit=0 so we have no incoming cover. I set L using the observed lead times (average=0). I treat demand as a new lower regime and use recent_N=4 to compute mu_hat and sigma_hat: mean(118,139,122,73)=113 units for the (1+L) review+lead period, std\u224828.18.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
On-hand=10, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show actual lead_time=0 consistently. Recent downward regime: last 4 concluded demands (Periods 18\u201321 = 139,122,73,116) average 112.5 with std \u224824.32. I set L to promised (0) and use recent_N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current low-demand regime and avoid overstock given holding cost>0 and thin pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Sustained lower-demand regime: last 4 concluded demands (Periods 18\u201321) mean=112.5, std\u224824.32; treat as current until contradicted.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/22. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. All concluded arrivals show actual lead_time=0 historically (every conclude shows arrived same-period). Recent demand has settled to a lower regime. I use L=default(promised)=0 because concluded history consistently shows 0. For demand I use recent_N with N=4 (most recent 4 concluded demands: Periods 20-23 = [73,116,120,120]) giving mean=107.25 and sample std\u224822.90; set mu_hat=(1+L)*mean and sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std to capture current regime and limit holding cost while maintaining service.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29. All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 consistently; recent demand has fallen markedly. Last 4 concluded demands (Periods 21-24) = [116,120,120,63], mean=104.75, std\u224824.16 \u2014 I treat this as the current sustained low-demand regime. On-hand=55, in-transit=0 so pipeline covers 0 future arrivals; with promised L=0 we must size (1+L)-period coverage. I set L based on observed lead times (0). I set mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to reflect the new lower mean demand and avoid overstocking; sigma_hat uses recent_N to reflect observed volatility. These parameters lower target base-stock to reduce holding cost while preserving service for the reduced demand level.

Carry-over insight: New sustained lower-demand regime: last 4 concluded demands (Periods 21-24) mean=104.75, std\u224824.16; treat as current until contradicted.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-08-05. All concluded arrivals show sustained lead_time=0. Recent demand has trended lower: the last 4 concluded demands (Periods 22\u201325 = 120,120,63,94) average 99.25 with std \u224823.48, indicating a new lower-demand regime vs prior carry-over. I set L to promised (0) consistent with sustained observed lead_time=0. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the latest regime ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This reduces overstock risk while preserving service given current lower demand and moderate volatility.

Carry-over insight: New sustained lower-demand regime: last 4 concluded demands (Periods 22\u201325) mean=99.25, std\u224823.48; treat as current until contradicted.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead_times are consistently 0 (all concluded arrivals list lead_time=0), so L set to the average observed (0). Recent demand shows a lower regime in the last 4 concluded periods (Periods 23\u201326: demands 120,63,94,146) with mean=105.75 and std\u224835.54; I use recent_N (N=4) to capture this most recent regime for the (review+lead) demand forecast and volatility. This keeps base_stock responsive to the current lower but variable demand while avoiding overstock given zero pipeline and positive holding cost.

Carry-over insight: New sustained demand regime (Periods 23-26): mean=105.75, std\u224835.54; treat as current until contradicted.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-08-19. All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 historically. Recent demand spike in Period 27 (301) changed the last-4 demand sample (Periods 24\u201327 = 63,94,146,301) to mean=151 and high volatility (std\u2248105.73). I treat lead time as 0 (average of observed lead times=0). For demand I use recent_N (N=4) to capture the new regime driven by the large recent spike; mu_hat=(1+L)*mean_last4=151. sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=4) to reflect elevated uncertainty (std_last4\u2248105.73). These parameters increase target base-stock to cover the elevated short-run mean while the large sigma raises safety stock to avoid stockouts given the spike-driven variance.

Carry-over insight: New recent demand regime (Periods 24\u201327): mean=151.0, std\u2248105.73 (evidence: demands 63,94,146,301); treat as current until contradicted.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-08-26. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. All concluded arrivals show actual lead_time=0 historically, so keep L=promised (0). Recent demand has jumped (Periods 25\u201328 demands = 94,146,301,251) \u2014 evidence of a new higher and more volatile regime. Use recent_N=4 to capture this shift for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine raises the base-stock to meet higher short-term demand while accounting for increased variance.

Carry-over insight: New sustained demand regime: last 4 concluded demands (Periods 25\u201328) mean=198.0, std\u224882.05 (demands 94,146,301,251); treat as current until contradicted.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/2 (Period 30). On-hand=8, in-transit=0. All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 consistently \u2014 no evidence of delays or lost shipments. Recent demand has trended up sharply: last 4 concluded demands (Periods 26\u201329) = [146,301,251,231], mean=232.25, elevated vs longer-run history. To prioritize service (profit $2 vs holding $1) I set lead time to observed avg=0 and forecast demand using the most recent 4-sample regime (captures the recent spike). This raises mu_hat to cover the review+lead window and uses the recent volatility for sigma_hat so the OR backend's base-stock will protect availability while limiting excess holding given moderate holding cost.

Carry-over insight: New sustained high-demand regime: last 4 concluded demands (Periods 26\u201329) mean=232.25, std\u224864.64; treat as current until contradicted.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:

Recent demand spiked: last 4 concluded demands (Periods 27\u201330) = [301,251,231,357], mean=285, std\u224848.77. I set L=0 (promised). Use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new high-demand regime so order targets cover the immediate next-period demand (review+lead =1 period). This raises base-stock to meet service while accepting holding cost tradeoffs given high profit ($2) vs holding ($1).

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/16 (Period 32). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 historically (orders consistently arrived same period). Recent data (Periods 28\u201331 demands = 251,231,357,328) indicate a sustained high-demand regime; use the most recent 4-sample regime to capture current demand level and volatility. Set L to promised/default (0). Set mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) \u2192 (1+L)*mean_recent = 291.75 to target service during this high-demand regime. Set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4) \u2192 sample std \u2248 60.33 to reflect elevated demand variability and avoid stockouts while balancing holding cost.

Carry-over insight: New sustained high-demand regime: last 4 concluded demands (Periods 28\u201331) mean=291.75, std\u224860.33; treat as current until contradicted.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 (consistent). Recent demand regime shifted sharply upward: last 4 concluded demands (Periods 29\u201332) = [231,357,328,341], mean=314.25, sd\u224856.77. On-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so we must replenish for the current high-demand regime. Set L using concluded history (default promised=0). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=4 to capture the new sustained high-demand level and volatility so the OR engine raises the base-stock to meet ~314 units of one-period demand while accounting for demand variation.

Carry-over insight: New sustained high-demand regime: last 4 concluded demands (Periods 29\u201332) mean=314.25, std\u224856.77; treat as current until contradicted.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/30 (Period 34). Recent history shows a very large spike in Period 33 demand (612) after already-high demands in Periods 30\u201332 (357, 328, 341). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must cover this elevated recent demand. Lead times historically concluded as 0 consistently. I therefore set L to promised/default 0 and use a recent_N=4 forecast for mu_hat and sigma_hat (captures the surge including the 612 spike). This raises the base-stock target to serve the immediate elevated demand while acknowledging higher volatility.

Carry-over insight: New recent high-demand spike: last 4 concluded demands (Periods 30\u201333) mean=409.5, sample std\u2248135.53; treat as recent elevated-demand regime (include Period 33 spike) until contradicted.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-07 (Period 35). All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 historically (all orders in history arrived same period). Recent demand shows a pronounced high-demand regime: last 4 concluded demands (Periods 31\u201334) = [328,341,612,313], mean=398.5 and sample std\u2248142.82. On-hand=155, in-transit=0; given high recent demand and zero observed lead time, set lead time to observed average (0) and forecast using the most recent 4-week regime to capture the elevated demand spike while avoiding smoothing that would under-forecast. This raises the base_stock input (mu_hat) and preserves high sigma to force OR to order more safety stock and avoid stockouts.

Carry-over insight: New sustained high-demand regime: last 4 concluded demands (Periods 31\u201334) mean=398.5, std\u2248142.82; treat as current until contradicted.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/10/14. Historical concludes show consistent actual lead_time=0; recent 4-period demand spike (Periods 32\u201335 demands = 341,612,313,283) indicates a new high-demand regime. On-hand=178, in-transit=0, so current coverage is well below expected next-period demand (~387). Set L=default (promised 0). Forecast demand across review+lead using recent_N=4 to capture the elevated regime: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last4)=387.25. Volatility from last4 sample std -> sigma_hat \u2248151.595. These parameters raise the base-stock to meet the high recent demand while acknowledging increased uncertainty (higher sigma) to avoid stockouts despite holding cost.

Carry-over insight: New sustained high-demand regime: last 4 concluded demands (Periods 32\u201335) mean=387.25, sample std\u2248151.60; treat as current until contradicted.

Daily Reward (R_t): $393.00

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent data (Periods 33-36 concluded) show a pronounced high-demand regime: demands = [612,313,283,282], mean=372.5, elevated volatility. Promised lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in history; no evidence of lost shipments. I therefore set L to the promised/default (0) and forecast demand using a recent_N=4 regime to capture the current spike. mu_hat is (1+L)*mean_recent = 372.5 to position the base-stock near the elevated demand; sigma_hat uses the sample std of the same 4-period window (sample std \u2248160.311) scaled by sqrt(1+L)=1. These parameters prioritize service during the current high-demand spell while keeping holding exposure aligned with observed volatility.

Carry-over insight: New sustained high-demand regime: last 4 concluded demands (Periods 33-36) mean=372.5, sample std\u2248160.31; treat as current until contradicted.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28. All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 consistently; on-hand=129, in-transit=0. Recent demand spike has settled: last 4 concluded demands (Periods 34\u201337) = [313,283,282,313], mean=297.75, sample std\u224817.61. I set L=default (promised 0) because concluded history shows 0 lead time. I use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to capture the current elevated regime: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_last4 = 297.75. sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=4) sample volatility: sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std_last4 \u224817.61. These parameters keep base-stock aligned with observed elevated demand while not inflating safety stock unnecessarily given low lead time, balancing profit vs holding cost. Current on-hand (129) plus zero pipeline implies we should order to refill toward the elevated regime.

Carry-over insight: Updated sustained demand regime: last 4 concluded demands (Periods 34\u201337) mean=297.75, std\u224817.61 (evidence: demands 313,283,282,313); treat as current until contradicted.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/4 (Period 39). History shows consistent same-period arrivals (observed lead_time=0 throughout concluded history), and recent sustained high-demand regime with last 4 concluded-demand mean=297.75, std=17.61 (Periods 34\u201337). On-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so we need to replenish for the current high-demand regime. Set lead time to the observed average (0). Use recent_N=4 demand estimates to capture the current regime (mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_recent, sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std_recent). These parameters raise the base-stock to serve the elevated demand while sigma is moderate, balancing service level against holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 historically; no in-transit stock and on-hand=106. Recent data (Periods 36\u201339 demands = 282,313,385,231) indicate a sustained high-demand regime vs older history. I set L to promised (0) because every concluded message shows lead_time=0. I use recent_N=4 for demand forecasting to capture the current high-demand regime: mean demand over next (1+L) periods = 302.75 units, with sample std \u224864.42. This raises the base-stock target to cover elevated demand while keeping sigma consistent with recent volatility; ordering will replenish toward that higher target while avoiding excessive holding cost given holding/profit tradeoff.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime (Periods 36\u201339) mean=302.75, std\u224864.42; treat as current until contradicted.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18. All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 historically (no late/lost shipments). Recent demand regime remains high: last 4 concluded demands (Periods 36\u201339/40 window) mean \u2248302.75, sd \u224864.42. On-hand=53, in-transit=0 so pipeline is low vs. recent demand. I choose L=default (promised 0) because concluded history consistently shows 0. For demand I use recent_N (N=4) to capture the sustained high-demand regime; mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_recent = 302.75 to target service during the current high-demand window. sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=4) = 64.42 so safety stock reflects observed volatility. These parameters raise base-stock to service elevated demand while OR's cap will limit extreme orders to control holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime persists: last 4 concluded demands mean=302.75, sd=64.42 (Periods ~36\u201339/40).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/25. On-hand=85, in-transit=0. Recent concluded demands (Periods 38\u201341) = [385,231,278,245], mean=284.75, sample std\u224869.70. All historical conclude messages show lead_time=0 \u2014 no evidence of shipment loss or lead-time change. Given high recent demand, I use a short recent_N forecast (N=4) to capture the current elevated regime and set L to promised (0) so OR orders to cover the review+lead period demand. This balances service (reduce stockouts during elevated demand) against holding cost by using a moderate safety buffer via the OR engine's z term rather than inflating mu_hat.

Carry-over insight: Updated sustained high-demand regime: last 4 concluded demands (Periods 38\u201341) mean=284.75, std\u224869.70; treat as current until contradicted.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times = 0 each period. Most recent concluded demands (Periods 39-42) = [231, 278, 245, 733] \u2014 large spike in Period 42 (733) materially raises short-term demand. I set L=default (promised 0) because all concluded lead_times = 0. To capture the recent elevation and ensure service during this possible spike, I set mu_hat using recent_N (last 4 concluded demands) so the OR engine targets a higher base-stock; sigma_hat also from recent_N to reflect high volatility. This increases order quantities to avoid stockouts from the observed spike while the high sigma moderates over-ordering via the cap.

Carry-over insight: Recent elevated-demand spike: Period 42 demand=733; last 4 concluded demands (Periods 39-42) mean=371.75, sd\u2248241.58 \u2014 treat as recent elevated-demand regime until contradicted.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/09 (Period 44). All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 historically. Recent demand regime shows an elevated/volatile spike around Period 42; last 4 concluded demands (Periods 40-43 = 278, 245, 733, 169) have mean=356.25 and high dispersion (sample std\u2248252.0). On-hand=307, in-transit=0 \u2014 inventory is currently near the recent 4-period mean but demand is volatile, so we target the recent 4-period demand estimate to capture the elevated spike risk while avoiding excessive holding. Chosen methods: infer L from most recent observed lead times (recent_N=4 \u2192 0); set mu_hat using recent_N=4 demand regime to capture the spike (mu_hat=(1+L)*mean_recent); set sigma_hat using recent_N=4 sample std scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances higher service level for the recent spike vs holding cost given current on-hand position.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16 (Period 45). All historical concludes show lead_time=0 consistently; recent demands show a pronounced spike (Period 42=733) and elevated recent average/volatility. I set L to the promised/default (0) since concluded lead times are 0. For demand I use a recent_N=4 estimate (Periods 41\u201344 demands = 245, 733, 169, 304) to capture the current elevated but volatile regime: mu_hat = mean*(1+L) = 362.75, sigma_hat = std*sqrt(1+L) \u2248 253.00. These parameters raise the base-stock to protect against stockouts from the recent spike while acknowledging high uncertainty (higher sigma increases safety stock but the OR engine will cap orders).

Carry-over insight: New recent elevated-demand regime: last 4 concluded demands (Periods 41\u201344) mean=362.75, sample std\u2248253.00; treat as recent elevated and highly volatile until contradicted.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (pre-Christmas week). Historical concluded lead times all 0 \u2192 use promised/default L=0. Recent demand spike persists: last 4 concluded demands (Periods 42\u201345) = [733,169,304,258], mean=366 units, sample std\u2248251. On-hand=214, in-transit=0 \u2192 current inventory covers ~0.58 of one-period demand at this elevated level, so raise target stock to avoid stockouts over the shopping week. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the recent 4-sample regime to capture elevated mean and high volatility; this increases base-stock and cap to prioritize service over holding cost given proximity to high-demand holiday period.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30 (Period 47). Historical concluded lead_times are consistently 0 \u2014 keep promised/default L=0. Recent demand shows a shift: last 4 concluded demands (Periods 43\u201346 = 169,304,258,128) have mean=214.75 and high volatility (sample std\u224880.53). I set mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the current regime (short review horizon, avoids diluting with older data). sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=4) to reflect elevated variability so the OR engine increases safety stock appropriately. This balances service (capture current elevated mean) against holding cost by using only the most recent 4 observations rather than the long historical series.

Carry-over insight: New recent demand regime: last 4 concluded demands (Periods 43\u201346) mean=214.75, sample std\u224880.53; treat as current until contradicted.
