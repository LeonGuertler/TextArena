Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019-02-11). SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer). Historical demands = [161,145,179,196,186] (mean=173.4). No concluded arrivals observed and on-hand=0, in-transit=0 so treat promised lead time as binding. Use default lead time (promised L=2) and default demand/statistics so backend computes (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility from full history. This ensures the base-stock covers the current plus L future periods while avoiding overfitting to short-term noise.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/2/18. On-hand=0, in-transit=207 (ordered Period 1) but arrived=0 in Period 1 conclude \u2014 no concluded arrivals yet, so no reliable evidence actual lead time differs from promised. Use promised lead time (default) and full-sample demand estimates to let the OR engine compute base_stock and cap using all historical samples; this balances service level vs holding cost while we wait for arrival confirmation.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/2/25. Recent concluded demands (Period1=227, Period2=284) are substantially above older historical samples, indicating an upward demand shift. On-hand=0, in-transit=437 (orders from Period1/2) are expected to arrive during this period but not yet visible \u2014 treat pipeline as present but continue to plan for higher demand. Set L to promised lead time to avoid falsely extending lead time without concluded arrivals. Use EWMA (gamma=0.5) for mu_hat to bias the (1+L) forecast toward recent high demands while retaining older data. Use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture current volatility from the most recent demand samples. These choices raise the base-stock to improve service during the detected uptick while keeping variance estimation focused on recent behavior.

Carry-over insight: Demand uptick: concluded demands 227 and 284 (Periods 1-2) are higher than prior samples [161,145,179,196,186]; treat as a sustained upward shift unless future concludes revert.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (2019/3/4). On-hand=0, in-transit=754 but no concluded arrivals for orders placed in Periods 1-3 \u2192 evidence of shipments missing/longer-than-promised lead time. To avoid understock if shipments are lost or delayed, set explicit longer lead time. Demand shows a recent upward shift (concluded demands 227, 284, and 198 after baseline samples); use a recent-N forecast to capture the new regime. Therefore: L explicit to guard against missing arrivals; mu_hat recent_N (N=5) to reflect the recent higher mean; sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 3: Demand uptick: concluded demands 227 and 284 (Periods 1-2) are higher than prior samples [161,145,179,196,186]; treat as a sustained upward shift unless future concludes revert.

Daily Reward (R_t): $325.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/11. Demand shows a sustained uptick (recent concluded demands 227,284,198,214 vs earlier [161,145,179,196,186]); conserve responsiveness to higher mean. Lead-time evidence: one concluded arrival shows lead_time=1 (Period3\u21924), while earlier Period1/2 orders remain unarrived (possible lost/shorter actual L). On-hand=103 and in-transit=721 provide large pipeline; still set lead-time based on observed arrivals (recent behavior) to avoid over-ordering for presumed L=2. Therefore: set L via recent_N (N=1) to reflect observed 1-period lead; set mu_hat and sigma_hat via recent_N (N=5) to capture the recent higher-demand regime (uses last 5 samples). This balances service level to new higher demand while avoiding excessive inventory given substantial in-transit stock.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/18. Recent concluded lead times (Periods 3->4 and 4->5) = 1 period, so actual lead time appears 1 (shorter than promised 2). Demand shows a sustained uptick: recent concluded demands [227,284,198,214,215] exceed earlier baseline. On-hand 172 + in-transit 437 = 609 units in pipeline. To reflect shorter lead time and higher recent demand, set L based on recent lead-time observations and use recent demand stats (last 5 periods) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend raises target inventory to meet elevated demand while avoiding excessive holding by using recent volatility.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/25. On-hand=0, in-transit=437. Historical concludes show two arrivals indicating actual lead_time=1 (orders from Periods 3 and 4 arrived in Periods 4 and 5). Demand regime: earlier low samples then an uptick; most recent 3 concluded demands (Periods 4-6) are 214,215,215 \u2014 a new, higher short-term regime. To keep pipeline aligned with observed lead-time and recent demand, set L based on calculated observed lead times, and set mu_hat/sigma_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the new mean/volatility while avoiding stale older samples. This addresses missing/late shipments by using observed lead time (not promised) and focuses target stock on recent demand to balance service vs. holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Observed lead_time has shifted to 1 period (arrivals: Period 4 concluded arrival=317 for order on Period 3; Period 5 concluded arrival=284 for order on Period 4).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. On-hand=0, in-transit=437. Concluded arrivals show consistent observed lead_time=1 (two observed arrivals with W=1). Recent demand is higher than original samples (recent concluded demands: 198,214,215,215,186 plus earlier 227,284), so I bias mu and sigma to recent data to capture the upward shift. Set L via 'calculate' to let backend use observed lead times; use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus on the most recent regime and limit inventory risk while covering (1+L) periods of demand. This balances higher service level for increased demand against holding cost given existing large in-transit inventory.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/8 Period 9. On-hand=0, in-transit=437. Recent concludes show actual lead_time=1 (arrivals for orders on P3\u2192P4 and P4\u2192P5). Demand has shifted upward vs original five-sample history; recent demands (P4\u2013P8 = 214,215,215,186,249) average ~216. To reflect observed faster lead time, set L via 'calculate' (avg observed lead times =1). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the sustained higher demand regime ((1+L)*mean of last 5 concluded demands). Use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to estimate volatility from the same recent window. This keeps pipeline cover tight given shorter actual lead time and raises target base-stock to meet the sustained higher demand while avoiding excessive holding given $1/period holding cost.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-04-15. On-hand=0, in-transit=446. Concluded arrivals show observed lead_time = 1 period (orders on P3->arrived P4; P4->arrived P5). Demand shows sustained upward shift vs initial samples (notably P1=227, P2=284 and continued higher demands). To account for the observed 1-period lead time I select lead-time inference (calculate). For demand I bias the forecast to recent regime using recent_N over the last 7 concluded demands to capture the uptick; same window for volatility to match the regime. These parameters raise the base-stock to cover the higher recent mean while reflecting recent variability; this helps the OR engine balance service (avoid stockouts given in-transit units) vs holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Observed lead_time shifted to 1 period: arrivals in Period 4 (317 units ordered P3) and Period 5 (284 units ordered P4) => lead_time=1; Demand sustained upward shift: concluded demands 227 and 284 (P1-P2) and continued elevated demands in subsequent periods compared with earlier baseline [161,145,179,196,186].

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). Recent concluded demands are elevated vs the earlier baseline (recent series: 227,284,198,214,215,215,186,249,178,130 vs baseline [161,145,179,196,186]) \u2014 treat as sustained higher-demand regime. On-hand=0, in-transit=446; given concluded arrivals in Periods 4 and 5 show lead_time=1, shipments appear to be arriving with 1-period actual lead time (orders placed earlier that concluded arrived after 1 period). Use observed lead time (calculate) to reflect actual arrivals rather than the promised 2. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the last 10 concluded demand samples to capture the elevated mean and volatility; this yields (1+L)-scaled demand over the review+lead horizon and increases target base-stock to reduce stockouts while sigma_hat recent_N captures current variability. These choices reconcile missing shipments by shortening the lead-time assumption and by sizing safety stock to current elevated demand, balancing profit vs holding cost.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/29 (Period 12). Recent concluded arrivals show variable lead times (arrivals: P4 for order P3 \u2192 LT=1; P5 for order P4 \u2192 LT=1; P11 for order P9 \u2192 LT=2), indicating actual lead time \u2260 promised and averaging >1. Demand history shows a sustained elevation vs the original five-sample baseline (notably demands 227,284 then continued elevated periods around ~200), so I bias the demand estimate toward recent data while smoothing noise. I set L to 'calculate' so the backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures observed 1,1,2). I set mu_hat to an EWMA with gamma=0.3 to emphasize recent elevated demand while retaining older data (reduces overreaction to single low recent weeks). I keep sigma_hat 'default' to let the backend use full-sample volatility scaled by (1+L). This combination acknowledges variable/shorter-than-promised lead times and elevated demand, improving service while controlling holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Observed lead time now variable but shorter than promised: observed LT samples = {1,1,2} \u2192 average ~1.33; Demand upward shift: recent concluded demands (227,284 and subsequent ~200s) exceed earlier baseline [161,145,179,196,186].

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/6. Recent concluded history shows a sustained demand uplift vs original baseline (early samples ~161-196, later concludes include 227,284 and multiple ~200s). Observed arrived orders give lead_time samples {1,1,2} -> average ~1.33, i.e. shorter than promised L=2 and variable. On-hand=0, in-transit=437 so pipeline is sizable but arrivals have been inconsistent. I set L to 'calculate' so backend averages observed lead times (captures the ~1.33 observed). For demand I use recent_N with N=5 to responsively capture the sustained higher-demand regime without overreacting to single spikes. I set sigma_hat to recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise the base-stock to cover the shorter/variable lead time and higher recent demand while letting the OR backend compute safety stock consistent with profit/holding tradeoff.

Carry-over insight: Observed lead_time regime now shorter and variable: samples {1,1,2} => avg ~1.33 (evidence: arrivals P4 from order P3, P5 from P4, P11 from P9). Demand sustained upward shift: concluded demands include 227, 284 and multiple ~200s versus earlier baseline [161,145,179,196,186].

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/27 (Period 16). Recent concluded arrivals show actual lead times {1,1,2} (avg ~1.33) \u2014 shorter than promised 2 and variable. Demand has shifted up vs original baseline: recent concluded demands (227,284,198,214,215,215,186,249,178,130,127,191,160,196,143) are elevated/volatile; treat recent window as new regime. Set L by calculating average of observed lead times. Use recent_N for demand mean and volatility to capture the new regime using all available recent samples (N=15). This balances service (capture higher recent mean) against holding cost by letting OR backend compute base_stock and cap using these inputs.

Carry-over insight: Observed lead_time regime shortened/variable: samples {1,1,2} => avg ~1.33 (evidence: arrivals P4 from order P3, P5 from P4, P11 from P9). Demand sustained upward/volatile shift: recent concluded demands (P1-P15 series) exceed earlier baseline [161,145,179,196,186].

For demand I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the latest regime (Periods 12-16 demands) so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7recent mean; sigma left as default to let backend scale overall volatility by sqrt(1+L).

Recent concluded history shows variable but shortened lead times (observed samples 1,1,2 => avg ~1.33) and a sustained higher-demand regime vs the very old five-sample baseline. On-hand=0, in-transit=437 so pipeline exists but promised LT=2 understates recent faster arrivals; I set L explicit=1.33 to reflect the observed shorter/variable LT. For demand I use recent_N (N=15) to capture the sustained elevated/volatile demand across the most recent periods rather than the old five-sample baseline. I set sigma_hat recent_N (N=15) to reflect recent demand volatility. These choices bias orders upward to avoid stockouts given faster arrivals and higher mean demand while letting the OR backend cap orders to control holding cost.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/17 (Period 19). History shows arrivals for orders: P3->P4 (LT=1), P4->P5 (LT=1), P9->P11 (LT=2) => recent LT samples {1,1,2} (avg~1.33) indicating lead time shorter/variable than promised 2. Demand history shows an upward shift vs. the earliest baseline (many concluded demands in the ~200s earlier) but the most recent 5-period demands are lower; to balance responsiveness to the shorter/variable lead time and recent demand variability, I set L using recent lead-time samples and mu_hat using the recent 5 demand samples to capture latest regime while keeping sigma conservative (backend default). These choices reduce risk of under-ordering given shorter LT observations while letting the OR engine compute safety stock from observed volatility.

Carry-over insight: Observed lead-time regime shortened/variable: samples {1,1,2} => avg ~1.33 (evidence: arrivals P4 from order P3, P5 from P4, P11 from P9). Demand exhibited an earlier sustained uptick into ~200s compared with baseline [161,145,179,196,186], but recent 5-period demands are lower; treat LT regime change as sustained until contradicted.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24 (Period 20). Recent concluded arrivals show observed lead times {1,1,2,1} (orders P3->arr P4, P4->P5, P9->P11, P18->P19) so actual LT is shorter than promised and averaging ~1.25; use backend 'calculate' to capture observed avg. Demand: early sustained uptick (P1- P8) was followed by a decline \u2014 the most recent 5 concluded demands (P15-P19 = 143,168,118,139,122) indicate a lower recent regime; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to adapt to this downshift and reduce overstock risk. This balances service level against $1 holding cost given profit $2 by tuning base-stock to recent demand and using observed lead-time average to size review+lead demand.

Carry-over insight: Observed lead-time regime shortened/variable: observed lead times = {1,1,2,1} => avg ~1.25 (evidence: arrivals P4 from P3, P5 from P4, P11 from P9, P19 from P18). Demand regime: recent 5-period demand (P15-P19) is lower (~138 mean) vs earlier elevated ~200s; treat recent downshift as current regime.

On-hand=0, in-transit=437 (some in-transit arrivals not yet concluded). To avoid overstock given lower recent demand while accounting for shortened/variable LT, set L to be calculated from observed lead-times so backend uses empirical avg. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor forecasts to the recent lower-demand regime and recent volatility so orders are sized to cover current demand levels and reduce holding cost exposure. This balances service level (capture in-transit) vs holding cost given the apparent downward demand shift.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-08 Period 22. On-hand=0, in-transit=437. Historical concluded lead times = {1,1,2,1} (avg ~1.25) indicating a shorter/variable lead-time vs promised 2; recent lead-time samples are the most relevant. Demand has softened in the last 5 periods (Periods 17-21 demands = [118,139,122,73,116], mean ~113.6) vs earlier elevated ~200s, so use a recent-demand estimate to avoid over-ordering against current lower demand. Choices: set L by averaging the 4 observed lead-time samples to capture current shortened/variable regime; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 demand samples to reflect the recent downshift and volatility. This keeps pipeline cover aligned to shorter actual LT while reducing base-stock to avoid excess holding costs given current low demand.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Recent demand has downshifted: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 18-22) = [139,122,73,116,120], mean ~114. I set L to recent_N (N=4) to capture the shortened lead-time regime. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N with N=5 to align forecast and volatility with the most recent lower-demand regime (covering review+lead period), reducing overstock risk while preserving service under shortened lead times. These choices help the OR backend reduce base-stock toward current lower demand and account for observed shorter lead times so orders arrive sooner, avoiding excess holding cost given profit/holding tradeoff.

Carry-over insight: Observed lead-time regime shortened/variable: recent concluded LT samples {1,1,2,1} => avg ~1.25 (evidence: arrivals P4 from P3, P5 from P4, P11 from P9, P19 from P18). Recent demand downshift: last 5 concluded demands (P18-P22) mean ~114 vs earlier elevated ~200s.

Recent demand has downshifted: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 18-22) mean ~114 vs earlier ~200s. To reflect shorter actual LT and the recent lower demand regime, set L by recent lead-time samples and set demand forecast/volatility using the most recent demand samples (N=5).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019/7/29). Recent concluded demands have fallen from prior ~200s to much lower values (last 5: 73,116,120,120,63) indicating a downshift in demand; observed lead-time samples recently = {1,1,2,1} suggesting a shortened/variable lead time (~1.25). On-hand=0, in-transit=437 (pipeline large). To reflect the shortened LT while reacting to the recent lower demand, set L using recent lead-time samples (recent_N=4) and set demand forecast and volatility using the most recent 5 demand conclues (recent_N=5). These parameters reduce target base stock to match lower recent demand while accounting for the shorter, variable lead time and the sizable pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime shortened/variable: recent concluded LT samples {1,1,2,1} => avg ~1.25 (evidence: arrivals P4 from order P3, P5 from P4, P11 from P9, P19 from P18). Recent demand downshift: last 5 concluded demands (P20-P24) mean ~98.4 vs earlier elevated ~200s.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/5 (Period 26). Recent concluded history shows lead-time samples {1,1,2,1} (arrivals: P4 from P3, P5 from P4, P11 from P9, P19 from P18) => avg ~1.25; recent demand has downshifted vs prior elevated ~200s\u2014last 5 concluded demands (Periods 20-24) mean \u224898.4. On-hand=0, in-transit=437 (pipeline large). To reflect the shorter/variable LT regime I set L using recent lead-time samples (recent_N). To capture the recent lower-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 demand samples (recent_N=5) so base stock and safety reflect current lower demand and reduced variance, preventing overstock given large pipeline. These choices help the OR backend lower target inventory while accounting for observed shorter lead times and recent demand downshift.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime shortened/variable: recent observed LT samples {1,1,2,1} => avg ~1.25 (evidence: arrivals P4 from P3, P5 from P4, P11 from P9, P19 from P18); Recent demand downshift: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 20-24) mean \u224898.4 vs earlier elevated ~200s.

Date 2019/8/12 (Period 27). Recent concluded lead times = {1,1,2,1} (arrivals: P4 from P3, P5 from P4, P11 from P9, P19 from P18) => recent average ~1.25, shorter than promised L=2. Demand has stepped down recently versus prior elevated ~200s; last 5 concluded demands (Periods 22-26 = 120,120,63,94,146) average \u2248108.6. On-hand=0, in-transit=437 currently covers multiple periods; to reflect shorter observed LT and recent lower demand I set L based on the recent lead-time samples and use recent-N estimates for demand mean/volatility (so mu_hat and sigma_hat focus on the most recent regime). This balances service (accounting for in-transit coverage and shorter LT) against holding cost by shrinking the forecasted (1+L) demand and using recent volatility to set safety stock.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19 (Period 28). Recent concluded lead-time samples = {1,1,2,1} (avg ~1.25) so actual LT is shorter than promised=2 and variable; pipeline=437, on-hand=0. Recent demand volatile with a sharp uptick in Period 27 (301) but last 5 concluded demands (Periods 23-27 = 120,63,94,146,301) have mean ~144.8. To balance service vs holding cost I set L to the recent average (shorter LT) and use recent demand statistics (last 5) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current regime and volatility; this keeps target inventory responsive to the recent spike while avoiding excessive holding given current pipeline.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Recent concluded demands show variable but elevated/volatile behavior; last 5 concluded demands = [63,94,146,301,251] (mean ~171). On-hand=0, in-transit=437 (pipeline covers some upcoming demand). Observed lead times from concluded arrivals = {1,1,2,1} (avg ~1.25) \u2192 recent shorter/variable LT. Choose L as recent_N to reflect the shorter recent lead-time regime (use last 4 observed LT samples). For demand forecast use recent_N over last 5 concluded demands to capture the current demand regime and volatility. Use recent_N for sigma_hat with same N to reflect recent variability. These settings align the base-stock target to current shorter lead time and recent demand pattern so the OR backend balances service level vs holding cost while accounting for in-transit inventory.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/2 (Period 30). On-hand=0, in-transit=437. Concluded lead-time samples = {1,1,2,1} (arrivals: P4 from P3, P5 from P4, P11 from P9, P19 from P18) => recent average ~1.25. Recent demand is volatile but the last 5 concluded demands (Periods 25-29 = 94,146,301,251,231) show a higher short-run mean (~205) vs earlier baseline. To reflect the shorter/variable lead-time regime and recent demand level while letting the OR engine compute pipeline-scaled forecasts, I set L to recent_N (use last 4 observed LT samples) and use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 (capture current demand regime and volatility). This balances service (higher recent demand) against holding cost and leverages observed shorter lead times so pipeline needs less cover. The in-transit 437 units will be reconciled by the backend when computing final order given these parameters.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-09 (Period 31). On-hand=0, in-transit=460. Observed lead times from concluded arrivals: LT samples = {1 (P4 from P3), 1 (P5 from P4), 2 (P11 from P9), 1 (P19 from P18)} \u2192 recent avg ~1.25 and clearly shorter than promised L=2. Demand has shifted up recently (Periods 27-30 demands = 301,251,231,357) so I use a short recent window to capture the new regime. Set L via recent_N (N=4) to reflect observed concluded LT samples; set mu_hat and sigma_hat via recent_N (N=5) to capture the recent high-demand regime (Periods 26-30). This increases target base-stock to cover the shorter/variable lead time while sizing safety stock for elevated demand, mitigating stockouts given in-transit inventory and potential lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime shortened/variable: recent concluded LT samples {1,1,2,1} => avg ~1.25 (evidence: arrivals P4 from P3, P5 from P4, P11 from P9, P19 from P18). Demand regime uptick: recent demands (Periods 26-30) = [146,301,251,231,357] \u2192 recent 5-period mean elevated (~257) vs earlier baseline.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/16 (Period 32). Recent demand has shifted up and become volatile: Periods 26-30 demands = [146,301,251,231,357] (5-period mean ~257). Concluded lead-time samples from history = {1,1,2,1} (orders P3->P4, P4->P5, P9->P11, P18->P19) => avg 1.25. Current inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=563 \u2014 sufficient to cover several periods but arrival timings are variable. I set L using recent_N (N=4) to capture the shorter/variable lead-time regime (avg=1.25). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to focus the forecast on the latest elevated/volatile demand regime (Periods 26-30). These choices bias orders toward higher baseline demand while reflecting tighter lead time to avoid overstocking given holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime shortened/variable: recent concluded LT samples {1,1,2,1} => avg ~1.25 (evidence: arrivals P4 from P3, P5 from P4, P11 from P9, P19 from P18); Demand regime uplift and volatility: recent 5-period demands (Periods 26-30) = [146,301,251,231,357], mean ~257 \u2014 treat as current demand baseline until contradicted.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-23 (Period 33). Recent demand has re-accelerated: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 28-32) = [251,231,357,328,341] => high/volatile recent mean. On-hand=0, in-transit=517 (these are undelivered and may cover upcoming demand but individual arrival timing is uncertain). Observed concluded lead times from history = {1,1,2,1,1} (orders: P3\u2192P4, P4\u2192P5, P9\u2192P11, P18\u2192P19, P31\u2192P32) => average ~1.2, shorter than promised L=2 and variable. To capture the shorter recent lead-time regime use L.recent_N (N=5) so backend averages last 5 observed L samples. For demand forecasting use recent data reflecting the new higher/volatile regime: mu_hat.recent_N with N=5 (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 demands). Volatility should reflect recent variability so set sigma_hat.recent_N with N=5 (backend computes sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of last 5 demands). These choices make base_stock respond to the elevated recent demand while using a lead-time estimate anchored to recent observed arrivals, balancing service level against holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

Concluded arrivals show variable but shortened lead-times (observed samples {1,1,2,1,1,3} \u2192 avg ~1.5) and recent demand has materially upticked and become volatile (recent concluded demands P29-P33 = [231,357,328,341,612]). Set L to be inferred from observed lead-time samples so the OR backend accounts for the shorter/variable regime. Use recent_N (last 5 periods) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor the forecast to the current elevated/volatile demand regime and reduce dilution from older low-demand samples. This balances service (higher base-stock for elevated demand) against holding cost given profit=2 and holding=1.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-07 (Period 35). On-hand=0, in-transit=714 (large pipeline but not yet visible). Recent concluded demands (Periods 30-34) = [357,328,341,612,313] show a sustained high/volatile demand regime vs earlier baseline. Observed concluded lead times recent sequence (Periods 32-34,19,11,33,34) shows variability; using a recent average to capture current shorter-but-variable lead time and to size safety stock. I choose L as recent_N (N=5) to reflect the most recent lead-time regime. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to anchor forecasting to the clearly elevated recent demand sample; this will raise the base_stock to avoid stockouts while sigma_hat recent_N captures increased volatility. This balances profit ($2) vs holding ($1) by targeting higher service during the current high-demand regime while relying on the capped order cap to limit over-ordering given pipeline=714.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-14 (Period 36). On-hand=0, In-transit=800. Recent demand has materially increased: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 31-35) = [328,341,612,313,283], mean \u2248375.4 per period. Lead time observations are variable; last 4 observed lead_times = [1,3,1,3] \u2192 recent average = 2. Using L recent_N=4 captures this short-but-variable regime. I set mu_hat recent_N=5 to anchor the (1+L)-period demand forecast to the most recent high-demand regime (N=5 recent samples). sigma_hat recent_N=5 to reflect recent volatility. Implication: (1+L)=3 \u2192 forecasted demand over review+lead \u22483\xd7375.4 \u22481126 units; current pipeline (800) is short vs. expected demand, so parameters will cause OR backend to order to replenish toward the elevated recent-demand baseline while accounting for recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime recently variable with short samples; last 4 observed Ls = [1,3,1,3] => recent avg \u22482 (use recent_N=4). Demand regime uplift: recent 5-period mean \u2248375.4 (Periods 31-35 = [328,341,612,313,283]); treat as current baseline until contradicted.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21 (Period 37). Recent concludes show a clear demand uplift (Periods 31-35 demands = [328,341,612,313,283], recent 5-mean \u2248375.4) and a shortened but variable lead-time regime: last 4 concluded lead times = [1,3,1,3] \u2192 recent avg \u22482. To target service during this high-demand regime while accounting for observed volatile/shorter arrivals (and potential lost shipments), set L using recent_N=4 to capture the most recent LT regime. Forecast mu_hat using recent_N=5 to reflect the strong upward demand in the last 5 periods. Use sigma_hat recent_N=5 to reflect elevated demand volatility observed in the same window. These choices bias orders toward higher coverage of the (1+L) review+lead horizon to avoid stockouts given current on-hand=0 and substantial in-transit (833) whose arrivals have been variable.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime recently shortened/variable: last 4 observed Ls = [1,3,1,3] => recent avg \u22482 (evidence: arrivals P32 from P31 L=1, P33 from P30 L=3, P34 from P33 L=1, P35 from P32 L=3). Demand regime uplift: recent 5-period mean (Periods 31-35) \u2248375.4 vs earlier baseline \u2014 treat as current baseline until contradicted.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). Recent concluded demand is elevated and volatile (Periods 32-36 demands \u2248 [341,612,313,283,282], 5-period mean \u2248366) vs earlier baseline. Pipeline shows 580 in-transit and on-hand 0; some recent orders have short/variable lead times (mix of 1 and 3). To protect service with current volatile/high demand while accounting for shorter/variable LT, infer L from the most recent lead-time samples and estimate demand and volatility from the most recent demand regime. Chosen methods: L recent_N (N=4) to capture the latest LT variability; mu_hat recent_N (N=5) to set base stock to the recent elevated mean across (1+L) periods; sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent demand volatility. These parameters bias ordering toward higher coverage given elevated demand and variable short lead times while the OR backend enforces caps.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime recently variable and shorter (recent concluded L samples show mix of 1 and 3; use recent_N=4, recent avg \u22482). Demand regime uplift and high volatility: recent 5-period mean \u2248366 (Periods 32-36 = [341,612,313,283,282]).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/4 (Period 39). Recent concluded lead-times are variable with short samples [1,3,1,3] -> use recent_N=4 to capture current LT regime (~2). Recent demand has moved to a higher, volatile regime: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 34-38 = [313,283,282,313,385]) average \u2248315; use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect current demand level and volatility. On-hand=0, in-transit=808 (pipeline provides coverage but LT variability warrants basing parameters on recent regime). These choices steer the OR backend to target a base stock sized to recent elevated demand while capturing observed lead-time variability.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime recently variable and shorter: recent concluded L samples [1,3,1,3] => use recent average \u22482 (evidence: arrivals P32 from P31 L=1, P33 from P30 L=3, P34 from P33 L=1, P35 from P32 L=3); Demand regime uplift and high volatility: recent 5-period demands (Periods 34-38) mean \u2248315.

Recent demand regime is elevated and volatile; use recent 5-period demand (Periods 34-38 mean \u2248315) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat via recent_N=5 so the OR engine plans for the high-demand, high-volatility environment. On-hand=0 with in-transit=808 provides substantial pipeline cover; chosen parameters reflect shorter/variable LT and elevated demand to avoid stockouts while letting backend cap orders based on its policy.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/18 (Period 41). On-hand=0, in-transit=808. Historical concluded lead-times are variable but recently short/mixed (recent concluded L samples \u2248 [3,1,3,1] \u2192 avg ~2), so use recent_N for L with N=4. Recent demand has uplift and volatility: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 36-40) = [282,313,385,231,278], mean \u2248298; use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture current regime. These choices make the OR backend size base-stock to cover the shorter/variable LT and the elevated recent demand while reflecting increased demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime recently variable but shorter: recent concluded L samples (last 4) \u2248 [3,1,3,1] => avg \u22482; Demand regime uplift: recent 5-period mean \u2248298 (Periods 36-40 = [282,313,385,231,278]).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019/12/2). On-hand=0, in-transit=619. Recent arrivals show a variable, shorter-than-promised lead-time; use recent lead-time estimate from latest concluded samples. Demand has recently uplifted and is volatile: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 38-42) = [385,231,278,245,733], 5-period mean \u2248374.4. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent 5 demand samples to capture current elevated mean and volatility. These parameters increase target base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of elevated demand while reflecting volatility; recent_N for L uses 4 most recent observed lead times to capture the short/variable regime.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime recently variable and shorter than promised: use recent concluded L samples (last 4) => avg \u22482 (evidence: multiple concluded arrivals with L in {1,3} across recent periods). Demand regime uplift and high volatility: recent 5-period demands (Periods 38-42) mean \u2248374 vs earlier baselines.

Historical concluded lead times are variable but recent concluded samples show short/variable LT; last 4 concluded lead times \u2248 [3,1,3,1] \u2192 recent avg \u22482. Recent demand has uplift and volatility: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 39-43) = [231,278,245,733,169], mean \u2248331.2. To capture the recent shorter/variable lead-time regime I set L using recent_N=4. To react to the recent elevated/volatile demand I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 so the OR base-stock reflects the most recent demand level and volatility. These choices help the OR backend size orders to cover (1+L) periods of the currently-observed demand while accounting for recent lead-time variability and avoiding excessive holding given holding cost=$1 and profit=$2.

=== Period 44 Summary ===

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16 (Period 45). On-hand=0, in-transit=838. Recent concluded lead-times are variable but shorter than promised (recent samples include L in {3,1,3,2} \u2192 use recent average). Demand is elevated and highly volatile over the last 5 periods (Periods 40-44 demands = [278,245,733,169,304] ) \u2014 treat recent 5-period mean as the best short-term demand anchor. To balance service vs holding cost: use a recent-N lead-time estimate to reflect actual shorter/variable arrivals, and recent-N demand (and volatility) so base-stock covers the immediate elevated demand regime without overcommitting to older lower-demand history.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/23. On-hand=0, in-transit=838 \u2014 substantial pipeline but arrivals have been variable vs promised L=2. Recent concluded lead-times show a mix (1,3,3,2) => shorter/variable regime; use recent_N to capture this. Demand recently elevated and volatile (recent 5 concluded demands P41-P45 = [245,733,169,304,258], mean \u2248342) so use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect current regime. These params give the OR backend a lead-time estimate responsive to recent delivery behavior and demand estimates that balance service (higher mu_hat) against holding cost given large in-transit stock.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime recently variable and shorter than promised: recent concluded L samples \u2248 {1,3,3,2} => avg \u22482 (evidence: arrivals in Periods 37,41,44). Demand regime uplift and high volatility: recent 5-period demands (Periods 41-45) mean \u2248342 vs earlier baselines.

Daily Reward (R_t): $126.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/30 (Period 47). Recent concluded demands are volatile but elevated vs early baseline; last 5 concluded demands = [733,169,304,258,128] (mean ~259). Multiple recent concluded arrivals show variable but shorter-than-promised lead times (recent observed L samples across last arrivals \u2248 {3,2,3,1,3} \u2192 use short recent average). On-hand=130 + in-transit=580 provides substantial pipeline but recent demand volatility warrants basing mu/sigma on most recent 5 demands and using a recent-average lead time to reflect observed faster/variable arrivals. Chosen L recent_N=4 to capture the latest short/variable regime; mu_hat recent_N=5 and sigma_hat recent_N=5 to make forecast and volatility responsive to the recent elevated/volatile demand, balancing service level (profit $2 vs holding $1) while avoiding excessive holding given existing pipeline.
