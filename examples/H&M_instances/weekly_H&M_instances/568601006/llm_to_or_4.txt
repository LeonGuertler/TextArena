Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Product: Mariette Blazer. Historical demand samples = [161,145,179,196,186] (mean=173.4). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 and no 'conclude' messages exist to infer actual lead time or lost shipments. Use promised lead time (default) and default demand estimates based on all samples to let the OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This balances service level using full-sample statistics while avoiding premature adjustments without arrival evidence.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 (2019-02-18). On-hand=0, in-transit=207 (ordered in P1) and no arrivals have been concluded yet \u2014 cannot infer actual lead time. Historical demand samples = [161,145,179,196,186] (mean ~173.4). Promised lead time (4) will be used and demand/volatility priors taken from full sample: choose default methods so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This is conservative given no concluded arrivals and avoids overreacting to a single missing conclude.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. No concluded arrivals yet (orders from P1/P2 remain in-transit), so actual lead time cannot be inferred. Historical demands = [161,145,179,196,186], mean=173.4; demand appears stable. Use promised lead time and default demand stats so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. In-transit=437 vs. forecast (1+L)\xd7mean=867, so replenishment still warranted to cover the (L+1)-period demand window.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/4. Demand history (samples) = [161,145,179,196,186], mean \u2248173.4. Three consecutive orders (periods 1\u20133) totaling 711 units remain in-transit with arrived=0; no concluded arrivals yet so actual lead time is not confirmed. I use default lead time (promised 4) because concluded messages do not prove a different stable lead-time regime. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, giving a demand forecast spanning the review+lead horizon while keeping parameterization robust to the current limited history. This approach hedges service level given the large in-transit volume but preserves responsiveness until arrivals or further losses are observed.

Carry-over insight: Three consecutive orders (Periods 1\u20133) totaling 711 units show arrived=0 despite being in-transit; flag potential delayed or lost shipments (evidence: Period 1\u20133 conclude messages).

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/11 (Period 5). Demand history stable (samples mean \u2248173.4). On-hand=0, in-transit=979 (orders from Periods 1\u20134) have not concluded \u2014 strong evidence of delayed or lost shipments. Promised lead time=4 but multiple consecutive orders failed to arrive; to protect service level I extend assumed lead time to 6 periods (explicit) so base-stock covers a longer pipeline. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR backend uses (1+L)\xd7historical mean and volatility (captures full review+lead demand under the extended L). This balances filling expected demand against holding cost given high in-transit uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Orders from Periods 1\u20134 (total 979 units) all show arrived=0 despite being in-transit \u2014 indicates a sustained delayed/lost shipment regime; treat lead time as longer until arrivals conclude.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Historical demands = [161,145,179,196,186]; on-hand=0, in-transit=1038. Concluded arrivals show Period 1 order (207) arrived in Period 5 with lead_time=4; earlier periods showed zero arrivals suggesting transient delayed shipments but we now have a confirmed observed lead time of 4. Set L using 'calculate' so backend uses average observed lead times (matches promised 4). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) \u2014 this balances service level vs holding cost given confirmed L and limited demand history.

Carry-over insight: Observed lead time confirmed = 4 periods (Period1 order: ordered on Period 1, arrived Period 5, lead_time=4). Prior multi-period non-arrivals indicate recent delivery delays but not yet a persistent change beyond confirmed L=4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $415.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25): recent concludes show two confirmed arrivals with lead_time=4 (Period1\u2192arrived in P5; Period2\u2192arrived in P6) after several periods of non-arrival, so actual lead time is best estimated from observed lead times. Current on-hand=15, in-transit=810; pipeline remains large despite past delayed arrivals. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures confirmed L=4). Demand parameters use defaults so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) \u2014 conservative aggregate estimates based on the five historical demands [161,145,179,196,186]. This keeps target base-stock driven by full-sample demand while letting OR backend cap orders; using observed lead-time avoids under-ordering if delays persist.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods based on concluded arrivals (Period1\u2192arrived in Period5, Period2\u2192arrived in Period6). Prior multi-period non-arrivals indicated delivery delays but the recent concludes validate L=4.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019/04/01): recent concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (Period1\u2192arrived in P5, Period2\u2192P6, Period3\u2192P7). On-hand=103, in-transit=756. Given confirmed L=4 and stable historical demand samples [161,145,179,196,186] (mean ~173.4), use the promised/confirmed lead time and population-wide demand stats so the OR backend computes base_stock and cap reliably. This balances service (use full (1+L) horizon) against holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08 (Period 9). Recent conclude messages (Periods 5\u20138) confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (orders from Periods 1\u20134 arrived with W=4). Current inventory: on-hand=122, in-transit=666. Historical demand (game history) shows elevated recent demands (periods 1\u20138: 227,284,198,214,215,215,186,249) but no clear sustained downward shift. Given confirmed L=4 and no strong recent demand regime change, use default lead time and default demand statistics so the OR backend computes base_stock = (1+L)*mean and sigma = sqrt(1+L)*std. This choice respects observed lead time, avoids overfitting short-term spikes, and lets the capped order cap limit order size given pipeline. It also accounts for earlier delayed arrivals (now concluded) by using confirmed L rather than inflating lead time.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods based on concluded arrivals (Period1\u2192arrived in Period5, Period2\u2192arrived in Period6, Period3\u2192arrived in Period7, Period4\u2192arrived in Period8); prior multi-period non-arrivals were delivery delays but deliveries have resumed.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:

Current inventory: on-hand=210, in-transit=665 (pipeline healthy). Historical demand samples show moderate demand (five-sample mean ~173.4). Given confirmed L=4 and resumed deliveries, use default lead time and default demand statistics so the OR backend computes base-stock from (1+L)\xd7historical mean and volatility. This balances service (avoid stockouts with large in-transit) versus holding cost.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). Recent conclude history confirms actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple concluded arrivals: Period1\u2192P5, Period2\u2192P6, Period3\u2192P7, Period4\u2192P8, Period5\u2192P9, Period6\u2192P10). On-hand=82, in-transit=835. Past demand samples = [161,145,179,196,186]; no strong recent demand regime shift. Earlier multi-period non-arrivals were delivery delays but deliveries have resumed and match promised L=4. Use promised/default lead time to keep OR engine aligned with confirmed behavior and let backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std for mu_hat/sigma_hat so base-stock and cap reflect observed demand variability and resumed pipeline. This balances service level (profit>holding) while avoiding overreaction to past delayed arrivals.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:

Earlier multi-period non-arrivals were transient delays but concludes since Period 5 confirm L=4. Use default lead time (promised=4) and default demand/statistics so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this leverages full history while recognizing confirmed L=4 and keeps orders sized to cover L+1 periods of demand given current pipeline, avoiding overreaction to earlier delays.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods based on multiple concluded arrivals (Period1\u2192arrived in Period5, Period2\u2192Period6, Period3\u2192Period7, Period4\u2192Period8, Period5\u2192Period9, Period6\u2192Period10, Period7\u2192Period11); deliveries have resumed and prior multi-period non-arrivals were temporary delays.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/3 (Period 17). Recent concluded history shows consistent arrived messages indicating actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple orders from Periods 1\u201312 onward concluded with lead_time=4). On-hand=148, in-transit=667. Demand samples and recent sale history show stable weekly demand; no fresh changepoint in demand mean/variance. Use default lead time (promised=4) and default demand aggregation/volatility so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, which fits confirmed L=4 and balances service vs holding cost given profit=$2, holding=$1.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). Recent concluded history consistently confirms actual lead time = 4 periods. Past demand samples = [161,145,179,196,186], mean=173.4 units/period (sample count=5). On-hand=363, in-transit=506 \u2192 pipeline+on-hand=869 units, which approximately equals (1+L)\xd7mean = 5\xd7173.4 = 867 units, so current inventory nearly covers the next (L+1)=5 periods of expected demand. Given confirmed L=4 and no strong demand shift or seasonality signals, use default statistical estimates so the OR backend computes base stock from full-sample mean/std. This balances service (coverage \u22485 periods) against holding cost and accounts for recent temporary delivery delays now resolved.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:

On-hand=410, in-transit=399 \u2014 pipeline looks healthy. Given confirmed L=4 and stable demand, use default demand/volatility estimates so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7sample mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std; this balances service level (maintain stock with confirmed lead time) against holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained actual lead time = 4 periods based on multiple concluded arrivals through Period 21; prior multi-period non-arrivals were temporary delays and deliveries have resumed.

LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019/7/15). SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer). On-hand=394, In-transit=400. Historical concluded arrivals show a sustained actual lead time = 4 periods (consistent concludes through Period 22). Recent demand samples = [161,145,179,196,186], mean=173.4 units/period; with (1+L)=5 this implies a 5-period demand forecast sum \u2248867. Given confirmed L=4 and no new loss signals, use the promised/confirmed lead time and default demand aggregation to let the OR engine compute base-stock and cap from full-sample statistics. This balances service (maintain coverage for L+1 periods) versus holding cost by relying on full-sample mean/variance rather than overreacting to short-term noise.

Current on-hand(403)+in-transit(381)=784 units, slightly below the (1+L) demand target, so the base-stock policy (default \u03bc\u0302/\u03c3\u0302) will trigger an order to replenish pipeline. Using default \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 keeps estimates tied to full-sample stats and lets the OR backend compute safety stock given profit/holding tradeoff.

LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Recent concluded history consistently shows actual lead time = 4 periods; deliveries have resumed. On-hand=450, in-transit=382 gives ample short-term cover but pipeline must cover (1+L)=5 periods. Use promised/default lead time to align with confirmed arrivals and avoid overreacting to prior temporary delays. Demand history shows no sustained regime shift, so use default demand estimators ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to balance service level (profit/holding tradeoff) while limiting excess holding cost.

Historical conclude messages consistently confirm actual lead time = 4 periods; earlier multi-period non-arrivals were temporary delays but deliveries have resumed. Given confirmed L=4 and stable demand history (past samples available), use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). Demand context: recent concluded history shows steady weekly demand with no regime shift; confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods from multiple concluded arrivals. Current inventory: on-hand=371, in-transit=352. Several prior multi-period non-arrivals resolved into normal 4-period deliveries, so treat lead time as promised (4). Use default estimators so the OR backend uses all samples to compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std \u2014 conservative choice that avoids overreacting to short-term noise while letting the backend balance service level vs holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained actual lead time = 4 periods based on multiple concluded arrivals through Period 26 (orders from Periods 1\u201322 consistently arrived with lead_time=4).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Recent concluded history consistently confirms actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple arrivals show ordered\u2192arrived with W=4). On-hand=180, in-transit=384 \u2192 pipeline plus on-hand covers several periods of demand. Given stable arrival pattern and no new evidence of lost shipments, use promised/confirmed L=4. Demand seed (provided samples) is limited but shows moderate mean/variance; use default aggregation so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service level (profit $2 vs holding $1 \u2192 q ~ 0.667) while avoiding overreacting to transient spikes (e.g., Period 27 demand=301). Defaults are conservative given resumed reliable deliveries.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=40, in-transit=532. Historical conclues consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple orders concluded with lead_time=4), deliveries have resumed and prior delays were temporary. Demand samples seed = [161,145,179,196,186]. Given confirmed L=4 and stable demand history, use default lead time and default demand stats so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service level (covering review+lead demand) against holding cost while acknowledging resumed reliable deliveries.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained actual lead time = 4 periods based on many concluded arrivals through Period 28 (evidence: concluded arrivals show orders from Periods n arriving in Periods n+4).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:

Historical demand samples (seed) given; no clear changepoint in demand. Use the promised/confirmed lead time (L=4) and default demand aggregation so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This keeps the base-stock tied to long-run sample mean/variance while the large in-transit pipeline provides protection versus short-term spikes and avoids overreacting to transient noise or past delays.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09): on-hand=0, in-transit=831. Concluded arrivals through Period 30 consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (orders n \u2192 arrived n+4). Use promised/default lead time to match observed regime. Historical seed demand (provided samples) mean = 173.4 \u2192 (1+L)*mean = 867; volatility from samples yields sigma scaled by sqrt(1+L). Choosing default L, mu_hat, sigma_hat lets the OR backend compute base-stock from established demand stats while respecting the confirmed 4-period lead time and current large pipeline; this balances service (avoid stockouts given in-transit) against holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $284.00

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-16 (Period 32). Recent demand has surged vs early samples (recent period demands include 301,251,231,357,328, many >200) and lead time has been repeatedly confirmed at 4 periods in concluded history. On-hand=0, in-transit=806 (covering multiple future periods) so pipeline is substantial but demand spike risks stockouts once pipeline depletes. I set L to default (use promised lead time = 4) because concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4. For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the recent high-demand regime and reduce underordering risk. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent elevated volatility. These choices bias the OR backend toward higher base-stock to protect service during the recent demand surge while respecting confirmed lead time and limiting excess holding beyond the near-term pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained actual lead time = 4 periods based on many concluded arrivals through Period 31 (orders from Period n arriving in Period n+4).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/23 (Period 33). Recent concluded history consistently shows actual lead time = 4 periods (orders from Period n arriving in Period n+4). Demand context: historical seed samples given and full demand history show elevated weekly demand spikes but no persistent downward regime; on-hand=0, in-transit=927 (large pipeline). To keep the OR engine aligned with observed deliveries and avoid overreacting to transient demand spikes, use default lead time (promised/confirmed L=4) and default demand statistics so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the full sample set. This balances service-level (avoid stockouts given large pipeline and confirmed L=4) against holding cost by relying on historical averages rather than short-window estimates.

Date 2019-10-14 (Period 36). Recent demand has spiked and become volatile in Sept\u2013Oct (Periods 31\u201335 demands: 328, 341, 612, 313, 283). On-hand=0, in-transit=978 (large pipeline). Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods. I set L to default (promised 4) because concluded history confirms L=4. For mu_hat I choose EWMA_gamma (gamma=0.3) to bias the (1+L)-period demand forecast toward recent high demand while retaining some inertia from prior history. For sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=5 (last 5 periods) to capture the recent surge in volatility; N=5 reflects the recent changepoint beginning around Period 31. These choices balance service (higher recent-weighted mean) against holding cost given a large in-transit position; EWMA limits overreaction while recent sigma captures true current variability so the OR backend's caps and safety-stock calculation behave sensibly.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained actual lead time = 4 periods through recent concluded arrivals up to Period 35 (orders from Period n arriving in Period n+4); prior multi-period non-arrivals were temporary delays and deliveries have resumed.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=98, in-transit=1130. Concluded arrivals across many periods consistently show orders arriving with lead_time=4; no persistent lost-shipment regime now. To match observed stable L=4 and let OR backend use promised lead time and historical sample stats, I select default for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the provided demand samples. This keeps policy aligned with confirmed lead time and avoids overreacting to earlier transient delays while letting the capped ordering logic limit order size versus pipeline.

Historical sample set shows no clear persistent demand regime shift vs. past data, so use promised/default lead time and default demand uncertainty. These settings keep the OR backend anchored to the validated L=4 while letting it compute base_stock and caps from full-sample statistics, balancing service level (meet demand over review+lead) against holding cost given current large pipeline.

Demand samples (seed) provided; no recent demand regime shift detected. Given confirmed L=4 and large in-transit stock covering upcoming periods, use default estimators so OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples.

Concluded history shows consistent actual lead_time = 4 periods across many concluded arrivals; prior delayed non-arrivals have resolved and deliveries have resumed. Use promised/default lead time to match observed L=4. Use default demand aggregation for mu_hat and default volatility for sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history\u2014this balances service (profit $2 vs holding $1) while letting the OR engine cap orders based on its cap rule.

No persistent demand regime shift detected vs. historical samples. To keep OR backend aligned with observed lead time and stable demand, use default lead time (promised = 4) and default demand moment estimates so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample set. This handles resumed deliveries while letting the OR engine set service-level safety stock based on profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/2 (Period 43). On-hand=0, in-transit=1084. History of concluded arrivals consistently shows orders arriving with lead_time=4 periods (multiple periods of confirmed arrivals through Period 42). Earlier multi-period non-arrivals were temporary delays but recent concluded history validates L=4. I therefore keep L as default (promised lead time=4). Demand has shown variability including recent large spikes (e.g. Period 42 demand=733) but no sustained new regime beyond normal volatility; use default demand estimators so the OR backend uses full-sample mean/variance scaled by (1+L). Using defaults balances service level (captures full historical mean over review+lead) against holding cost given current large in-transit position (1084 units).

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained actual lead time = 4 periods based on many concluded arrivals through Period 42 (orders from Period n arriving in Period n+4); prior multi-period non-arrivals were temporary delays and deliveries have resumed.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). Recent concluded history shows consistent actual lead time = 4 periods (many orders from Period n arriving in Period n+4). Current on-hand=199 and in-transit=873 \u2014 pipeline is large relative to past demand samples. Past demand samples (5 values) have mean = 173.0 and variance consistent with historical volatility; no recent demand regime change or calendar spike evident. Given confirmed L=4 and stable demand, use default lead time (promised L=4) and default demand statistics so the OR backend computes base_stock from full-sample mean/STD across the (1+L) horizon. This balances service level (using established lead time) while avoiding overreacting to in-transit inventory or transient missed-arrival noise.

Period 45 (2019/12/16). Recent concluded arrivals consistently confirm actual lead time = 4 periods. On-hand=78, in-transit=852 \u2014 pipeline is large and should cover (1+L) demand. To avoid overfitting temporary spikes (recent high demand variability around Sept\u2013Nov) I use the backend defaults so L=promised(4) and mu/sigma are computed from full sample history; this keeps ordering aligned with observed steady L=4 and the OR backend's service-level tradeoff.

Pipeline + on-hand (984) covers multiple weeks of demand, but year-end (Dec 23) can elevate demand; stick with promised lead time and statistical defaults so OR backend uses full-history mean/variance. Using default L lets backend apply confirmed lead time; default mu/sigma use all samples to balance service vs holding cost given stable lead-time regime.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). Demand context: recent history shows resumed, consistent deliveries with confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods; on-hand=225, in-transit=891 (pipeline healthy). Use promised/confirmed lead time to align OR engine with observed arrivals. No strong recent demand changepoint in the provided seed samples, so use default population estimates to let the OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility over the sample set. These settings keep service levels aligned to observed L=4 while avoiding unjustified increases in forecast or safety stock given stable long-run arrival behavior.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained actual lead time = 4 periods through recent concluded arrivals (deliveries from Period n arriving in Period n+4) \u2014 treat L=4 as current regime.
