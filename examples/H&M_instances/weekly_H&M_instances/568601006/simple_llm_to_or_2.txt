======================================================================


Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
(1) Historical pattern summary: recent demands = [161, 145, 179, 196, 186]; 5-period average = 173.4 with moderate variability. (2) Seasonal/calendar considerations: Current date 2019-02-11 (late winter/early spring) \u2014 blazers are seasonally relevant for transitional wardrobes; no major holiday in mid-February driving large spikes except possible Valentine's promotions which typically have limited impact on tailored blazers. (3) Recent trend analysis: modest upward linear trend across the 5 periods (linear slope \u2248 +10.1 units/period), last three periods show 179 \u2192 196 \u2192 186 (small pullback but overall higher baseline). (4) Final forecast logic: combine overall mean and positive linear trend, projecting one step forward from the trend. Linear-projection yields \u2248203.7, rounded to nearest whole unit for the next period.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
(1) Historical pattern: training demands = [161,145,179,196,186], mean=173.4, recent variability moderate. (2) Seasonal/calendar: current date 2019-02-18 \u2014 just after Valentine's Day (Feb 14) and late winter; blazers can see modest post-holiday uplift for events/return-to-work but no strong seasonal spike expected. (3) Recent trend: single test observation Period 1 (2019-02-11)=227, which is +30.9% vs training mean; this is a one-period spike with insufficient evidence for a regime change. (4) Forecast logic: combine historical mean with the single high recent observation conservatively (50/50 weighting) to respect the large but unconfirmed uptick, yielding forecast ~200.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
(1) Historical pattern summary: Training mean = 173 (5 periods: 161,145,179,196,186) with moderate variance; no clear seasonal signal in training. (2) Seasonal/calendar considerations: Current date 2019-02-25 \u2014 late-February can see pre-spring assortment rollouts and promotion-driven uplift for womens tailoring; no major holiday on this date. (3) Recent trend analysis: Test-phase shows a sharp two-period jump (227, 284) well above historical average, suggesting a possible upward shift but only 2 periods of evidence (insufficient to confirm a regime change). (4) Final forecast logic: weight recent demand more heavily but partially shrink toward historical mean due to limited confirmation. Recent mean = 255.5; training mean = 173.4. Weighted forecast = 0.7*255.5 + 0.3*173.4 = ~230.9 \u2192 rounded to 231.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
(1) Historical pattern: training mean demand = 173.4 (periods prior: [161,145,179,196,186]). (2) Seasonal/calendar: current date 2019-03-04 \u2014 early March, transition to spring; blazers can see increased demand during spring wardrobe refreshes and post-valentine retail activity, no major holiday this week. (3) Recent trend analysis: test observations show three consecutive higher values: 227 (2019-02-11), 284 (2019-02-18), 198 (2019-02-25); test mean = 236.3 (+36% vs training mean). No clear sustained upward slope within the three points (peak then partial pullback). (4) Forecast logic: given a clear, sustained level shift across 3 periods and limited data, weight recent mean as best predictor while being conservative against the single spike; use the 3-period average (236.3) rounded to integer.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at 2019-02-11 to 2019-02-25: average increased from 173.4 to 236.3 (+36%), observed over 3 consecutive periods.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
(1) Historical pattern summary: Training period demands were lower (mean ~173.4 across earlier training), but recent observed test-period demands are higher: [227, 284, 198, 214] (mean=230.75) indicating a higher demand regime vs training. (2) Seasonal/calendar considerations: Current date 2019-03-11 is outside major year-end holiday peaks; blazers have steadier demand during transitional seasons (late winter \u2192 spring). No immediate holiday spikes expected. (3) Recent trend analysis: Periods 1\u20133 (2019-02-11 to 2019-02-25) showed a confirmed higher regime (avg ~236.3); Period 4 (214) is slightly lower but still elevated vs training\u2014no clear downward trend, just short-term volatility. (4) Final forecast logic: Weight recent observed mean heavily while allowing modest mean-reversion toward the short-term mean; forecast next period near recent average (231), rounded to an integer and slightly conservative given volatility.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
(1) Historical pattern summary: training avg was ~173 with prior values [161,145,179,196,186]; recent test observations show materially higher demand: [227,284,198,214,215] (test avg 227.6). (2) Seasonal/calendar considerations: current date Mar 18 \u2014 no major retail holiday driving blazers; demand likely reflects a sustained post-training regime rather than a calendar spike. (3) Recent trend analysis: recent five-period mean 227.6; last three-period mean 209 shows slight pullback from an early spike (284) but demand remains well above training. No clear intra-month seasonality evident. (4) Final forecast logic: weigh recent mean heavily while accounting for modest reversion from the high 284 week; forecast near recent average rounded to integer.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
(1) Historical pattern summary: Training-period mean was ~173 with values [161,145,179,196,186]. Test-phase observed demand is materially higher: Periods 1\u20136 = [227,284,198,214,215,215], overall test mean \u2248 225. (2) Seasonal/calendar considerations: Current date 2019-03-25 \u2014 late March, spring wardrobe transition; no major holidays expected that would sharply change blazer demand. Typical seasonal uplift vs winter baseline appears already present in Feb\u2013Mar data. (3) Recent trend analysis: After a spike in Periods 1\u20132, demand settled to a stable level in Periods 4\u20136 (214,215,215). No clear upward or downward trend over the last 3 periods \u2014 essentially flat. (4) Final forecast logic: Weight recent stable observations most heavily (Periods 4\u20136 average \u2248 214.7) while acknowledging elevated regime vs training data. Forecast the next period close to the recent stable mean, rounded to an integer.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
(1) Historical pattern: Training periods showed baseline average ~173 with a regime shift reported earlier raising mean to ~236 for several periods. Test-phase observed demands are higher than original baseline: Periods 1-3 avg = 236.3, Periods 4-7 values = [214,215,215,186]. (2) Seasonal/calendar: Current date 2019-04-01 (early spring) \u2014 blazers are seasonally appropriate for spring layering; no major retail holiday this week to drive large spikes. (3) Recent trend: After an early test-period spike, demand has moderated. The most recent 4-period average (P4\u2013P7) = 207.5; the last 3-period average (P5\u2013P7) = 205.3 with a drop to 186 in the last period, suggesting some short-term softness but not a confirmed new regime. (4) Forecast logic: Weight recent average with slight conservatism toward the last-period decline -> forecast rounded to 205.

LLM Rationale:
(1) Historical pattern summary: Training mean = 173.4 (five periods: 161,145,179,196,186). Test-period observations (8 periods) show higher demand: [227,284,198,214,215,215,186,249], test mean = 223.5. (2) Seasonal/calendar considerations: Product is a women's blazer (spring season relevance); current date 2019-04-08 is early April\u2014transition to spring can increase demand for lightweight tailoring; no major holiday this week to drive a large spike. (3) Recent trend analysis: Recent periods show stability around ~214\u2013216 with a brief dip (186) and rebound (249). Last 5-period average (Periods 4\u20138) = 215.8; last 3-period average (6\u20138) = 216.7. (4) Final forecast logic: Weight recent observations more heavily and use the recent plateau around 215\u2013217 as the best predictor for next period.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
1) Historical summary: Training period (5 observations) centered ~173 (values 161,145,179,196,186). Test-phase observed higher levels (Periods 1\u20139 avg = 216). 2) Seasonal/calendar: mid-April (spring) can sustain demand for womens tailored blazers for work/spring collections; no major holiday spike this week. 3) Recent trend: test-phase shows elevated regime vs training; recent 3-period average (P7\u2013P9) = 204, last value P9 = 178 (short-term volatility). 4) Forecast logic: weight recent observations more but account for regime lift versus training and short-term variability; choose a rounded value near the 3-period recent average and slightly conservative given P9 drop.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
(1) Historical pattern summary: Training demands were [161,145,179,196,186] (mean ~173). Test-phase observed periods 1-10: [227,284,198,214,215,215,186,249,178,130] with mean ~210 and higher volatility. (2) Seasonal/calendar considerations: Current date 2019-04-22 (spring) \u2014 blazers see moderate spring demand; Easter fell around 2019-04-21 which can cause short-term spike earlier in April (consistent with period 8=249) followed by post-holiday drop. Major retail events not expected this week. (3) Recent trend analysis: After a high in early/mid-March and early April, demand has declined sharply over the last 3 periods (periods 8->10: 249 -> 178 -> 130). 3-period avg (P8-P10)=~186 vs prior 3-period avg (P5-P7)=~205; strong short-term downward momentum post-Easter. (4) Final forecast logic: Weight recent observations more heavily due to clear short-term decline; combine last value (130) with 3-period average (~186) and modest reversion toward recent mean -> predicted demand rounded to integer 145.

Carry-over insight: Downward trend since 2019-04-01 to 2019-04-15: demand fell from 249 to 130 (-47.8%) over 3 consecutive periods; 3-period avg (2019-04-01 to 2019-04-15) = 185.7.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
(1) Historical pattern summary: Training data shows mid-range weekly demand (161,145,179,196,186). Test-phase observed demands are higher and more volatile (227,284,198,214,215,215,186,249,178,130,127). (2) Seasonal/calendar considerations: Late April (no major retail spikes); blazers are seasonally stable for spring\u2014no calendar-driven uplift expected. (3) Recent trend analysis: Clear downward move since early April: period8=249 -> period9=178 -> period10=130 -> period11=127. 3-period recent avg (periods 9-11) = 145. (4) Final forecast logic: Weight recent periods heavily due to clear downward regime; use 3-period recent average as best estimate.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
(1) Historical pattern summary: Training avg ~173 with moderate variability; test period shows high variability (range 249->127). (2) Seasonal/calendar: Early May (spring) for womens tailored blazers typically steady/moderate demand; no major holiday spikes in early May. (3) Recent trend analysis: Sharp drop in early April confirmed in carry-over; last 4 periods (178,130,127,191) show partial recovery toward historical mean. (4) Final forecast logic: blend recent recovery with longer-run mean (weight recent periods but pull toward training mean). Using weighted recent avg (~160\u2013175) leads to forecast of 170.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
(1) Historical pattern summary: Training avg = 173.4 (training demands [161,145,179,196,186]). Test-phase observed values show higher volatility: recent 13 periods range 127\u2013284 with multi-week swings. (2) Seasonal/calendar considerations: Mid-May (2019-05-13) is outside major holiday peaks; blazers are seasonally stable in spring for work/events \u2014 no strong seasonal spike expected. (3) Recent trend analysis: Last 3 test observations (Periods 11\u201313 = 127, 191, 160) show no sustained trend (one up, one down); 3-period avg = 159.3, longer-run test avg (Periods 1\u201313) \u2248 187, and training avg \u2248 173.4. (4) Final forecast logic: Weight recent 3-period average more heavily due to regime variability but anchor toward training mean; choose a conservative integer near the 3-period avg. Forecast = 159.

(2) Seasonal/calendar considerations: Current date 2019-05-20 (spring) \u2014 blazers maintain steady demand for transitional weather and no major holiday drivers this week. (3) Recent trend analysis: Last 3 periods (Periods 12\u201314 = 191, 160, 196) average 182.3, showing a rebound from the April lows and no sustained new regime. (4) Final forecast logic: Weight recent periods more heavily; use 3-period average rounded to integer for next period demand.

(2) Seasonal/calendar considerations: Late May (spring\u2192early summer) typically no major retail spike for women's blazers; demand likely stable or slightly lower vs early spring. (3) Recent trend analysis: Last 3-period average (P13\u2013P15 = 160,196,143) = 166.3; last 5-period average (P11\u2013P15) = 163.4, indicating a recent lower-demand regime versus earlier highs.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
(1) Historical summary: Training period demands averaged ~177 (values: 161,145,179,196,186). Test-phase observed high variability with early-season peaks (Feb\u2013Mar) and a general decline into late May/early June. (2) Seasonal/calendar: Current date 2019-06-10 (early June) \u2014 warm-season beginning; blazers typically see reduced demand vs spring push and promotional retail peaks (Feb\u2013Apr). No major holiday in early June to boost blazer demand. (3) Recent trend analysis: Recent 3-period avg (P15\u2013P17) = 143; 5-period avg (P13\u2013P17) = 157; 7-period avg (P11\u2013P17) \u2248 158. Recent observations show a downshift from earlier highs with no new sustained upward reversal. (4) Forecast logic: Weight recent averages more heavily while accounting for seasonal dampening into summer; choose a conservative estimate near the 5\u20137 period average but slightly below to reflect seasonal decline. Final forecast set to 150.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM Demand Forecast:

LLM Rationale:
(1) Historical summary: Past test periods show high variability with peaks early (periods 1-2: 227,284) and generally lower values in late spring/early summer. Overall mean (periods 1-18) = 185.4. (2) Seasonal/calendar: Current date 2019-06-17 is early summer when demand for a lined womens blazer typically softens vs. spring; no major retail holiday to boost demand. (3) Recent trend: Last 3 periods = [168,118,139], 3-period average = 141.7, showing a recent downshift from earlier levels. No sustained new regime change (needs 3+ consistent higher/lower periods beyond normal variability). (4) Forecast logic: blend recent behavior with longer-run average to be responsive but conservative: weighted average 60% recent 3-period avg (141.7) + 40% overall mean (185.4) -> 159 (rounded).

(2) Seasonal/calendar: Current date 2019-06-24 (early summer) typically reduces demand for lined women's blazers vs spring; no major retail holidays to boost demand. (3) Recent trend: Last 3 periods: 118, 139, 122 (3-period avg = 126.3) showing short-term stabilization in the low-100s after prior volatility. (4) Forecast logic: Blend recent short-term average (weight 0.7) with 7-period average (~149) (weight 0.3) and apply slight downward seasonal adjustment for summer -> final integer forecast 130.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
(1) Historical pattern summary: Training data shows mid-range demand (avg ~173) with some volatility; test-phase periods 1-20 vary 73\u2013284 with an overall downward drift into June. (2) Seasonal/calendar considerations: Current date 2019-07-01 (summer) typically reduces demand for a tailored blazer vs spring; no major retail holiday in early July boosting blazer sales. (3) Recent trend analysis: Last 4 observed demands (Periods 17\u201320) = [118,139,122,73], 4-period avg = 113; last 3 avg = (139+122+73)/3 = 111.3. The sharp drop to 73 in Period 20 suggests a possible short-term outlier or continued summer weakness but is not yet a clear sustained regime change. (4) Final forecast logic: Weight recent observations more heavily while accounting for summer softening; use the 4-period average (113) rounded to integer as the best estimate for Period 21.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
(1) Historical pattern summary: Test-phase demands are volatile with peaks in Feb\u2013Apr (many values 180\u2013284) and lower, inconsistent values from May\u2013Jul. Overall mean of all 21 observed periods \u2248 171; median \u2248 168. (2) Seasonal/calendar considerations: Current date is early July \u2014 off-peak for womens tailored blazers (summer months often lower demand); no major retail holiday to drive a spike. (3) Recent trend analysis: Last 6 periods (P16\u2013P21) average \u2248 123 with high variance and no sustained directional regime; last 4 periods (P18\u2013P21) average \u2248 113, indicating a lower short-term level vs earlier periods. No 3+ period sustained shift newly detected. (4) Final forecast logic: Weight recent periods more heavily while accounting for volatility and seasonal summer softness; use a conservative rounded short-term average between the last 4\u20136 periods -> forecast 120.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM Demand Forecast:

LLM Rationale:
(1) Historical summary: Test-phase demands are volatile with peaks early (227\u2013284) then general decline; overall recent values are lower than initial peaks. (2) Seasonal/calendar: Current date 2019-07-15 \u2014 mid-July summer period typically reduces demand for women's blazers (lighter seasonal demand). No major retail event this week to boost blazer demand. (3) Recent trend: Periods 19\u201322 = [122, 73, 116, 120] show a dip at Period 20 followed by partial recovery; 4-period avg = 107.8, 3-period avg (20\u201322) = 103.0; no clear sustained regime change. (4) Forecast logic: weight recent observations more heavily while accounting for summer softness; use 4-period average rounded to nearest unit -> 108.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
(1) Historical summary: early test periods show higher demand (200s) then a general decline into mid-year with volatility; recent values are: P20=73, P21=116, P22=120, P23=120. (2) Seasonal/calendar: product is a blazer (spring/autumn demand); current date 2019-07-22 (midsummer) typically sees lower blazer demand, consistent with recent lower volumes. (3) Recent trend: sharp drop at P20 followed by recovery and stabilization over the last three periods (P21\u2013P23 average = 118.7), suggesting short-term stabilization rather than a new sustained regime. (4) Forecast logic: weight most recent periods heavily while accounting for summer softness; use the 3-period recent average rounded to an integer as the forecast.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
(1) Historical summary: training demands [161,145,179,196,186] show moderate variability around 173 avg. Test-phase observed large swings early (peaks ~284) then general decline into summer with recent values: P21=116, P22=120, P23=120, P24=63. (2) Seasonal/calendar: late July (summer) typically depresses demand for womens tailoring; no holiday-driven uplift expected. (3) Recent trend: clear downward shift since spring; last 4 periods average = 104.8 but P24=63 may be an outlier dip. Last three stable periods (P21\u2013P23) avg = 118.7. (4) Forecast logic: combine recent stability and the single low outlier by weighting last 4 periods (50% weight) and last 3 stable periods (50% weight) => (104.75*0.5 + 118.7*0.5) = 111.7, round to nearest integer.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
(1) Historical summary: Training demands = [161,145,179,196,186] show mild upward bias then stable mid-high 100s. Test period shows peak early (Periods 1-6 mostly 198-284) then general decline into summer with volatility. (2) Seasonal/calendar: Current date 2019-08-05 is midsummer \u2014 blazers typically see lower demand in warm months; no major retail holiday in early August to boost demand. (3) Recent trend: Last 5 test periods (Periods 21-25) = [116,120,120,63,94], 5-period avg = 102.6; last 3 = [120,63,94], 3-period avg = 92.3, recent single-period = 94. Variability present but short-term mean near ~95-103. (4) Forecast logic: weight most recent observations (3-5 periods) due to nonstationary decline and summer seasonality; produce a conservative near-term estimate slightly above the 3-period avg to account for reversion toward the 5-period mean.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
(1) Historical pattern summary: Test-period demands show high volatility with early peaks (Periods 1-9 often >170) and a mid-period decline; overall mean of Periods 1-26 \u2248 156, median \u2248 139. (2) Seasonal/calendar considerations: Current date 2019-08-12 in late summer; blazers show modest demand entering late summer/back-to-work season (potential slight uptick toward Aug/Sep). (3) Recent trend analysis: Periods 24-26 = 63, 94, 146 indicate a sharp 3-period rebound. Recent 3-period average = 101; recent 4-period average = 106. (4) Final forecast logic: combine short-term momentum (recent rebound) with longer-run average and seasonal modest uplift, weighting recent 3-4 periods more heavily -> forecast rounded to nearest unit.

Carry-over insight: Upward trend from 2019-07-22 (Period 24) to 2019-08-05 (Period 26): demand rose from 63 to 146 (+132%), 3-period avg = 101.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
(1) Historical summary: demand has been volatile with multiple regime shifts; recent periods: 63, 94, 146, 301 showing a sharp uptick. (2) Seasonal/calendar: product is a women's blazer \u2014 potential higher demand in transitional seasons and promotional weeks; current date 2019-08-19 (late summer) may see pre-fall interest but no major holiday. (3) Recent trend analysis: strong short-term upward movement from Period 24->27, but the Period 27 spike (301) is a single large observation; not yet a sustained regime change. (4) Forecast logic: weight recent observations more but remain conservative given single-period spike \u2014 use 3-period average of Periods 25-27 (94,146,301 = 180.3) rounded to nearest integer.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
(1) Historical summary: past test-period demand is volatile with multiple regime shifts; overall values range 63\u2013301 with recent high volatility. (2) Seasonal/calendar: late August (period 29 = 2019-08-26) aligns with end of summer/back-to-school and pre-fall tailoring demand, which can increase blazer demand. (3) Recent trend: periods 26\u201328 = [146, 301, 251] show a sustained upward regime vs earlier summer trough (periods 23\u201325 avg \u2248 92); recent 3-period avg = 232.7, indicating a significant rebound. (4) Forecast logic: weight recent 3-period average heavily while allowing modest mean reversion from the 301 spike; therefore predict near the recent average adjusted slightly downward.

Carry-over insight: Upward regime confirmed at Periods 26\u201328: avg increased from 92.3 (Periods 23\u201325) to 232.7 (Periods 26\u201328), change +152%; sustained over 3 consecutive periods.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM Demand Forecast:

LLM Rationale:
(1) Historical summary: recent training/test shows volatility with a sustained low-mid winter spring then sharp uptick in late July\u2013Aug. Last 5 observed demands: [146, 301, 251, 231] (Periods 26\u201329) following prior lows (Periods 20\u201325). (2) Seasonal/calendar: Current date 2019-09-02 (start of September) typically sees back-to-work / early autumn assortment demand for womens blazers, supporting sustained higher demand vs midsummer lows. No immediate holidays to depress demand this week. (3) Recent trend: Strong upward regime established from Period 26 onward; 4-period avg (Periods 26\u201329) = 232.25, recent values show high but some variability (146 -> 301 -> 251 -> 231). No evidence of reversal. (4) Forecast logic: weight recent regime heavily while smoothing variability \u2014 use the recent 4-period average rounded to integer as the next-period forecast.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
(1) Historical pattern: demand volatile with multiple regime shifts; recent stretch (P26\u2013P30 = 146,301,251,231,357) shows elevated, high-variance demand compared with mid-year lows (P20\u2013P25 avg ~95). (2) Seasonal/calendar: Early September (2019-09-09) corresponds to back-to-work/school and fall tailoring season, which supports higher blazer demand. (3) Recent trend: strong uptick since P26 with 3-period avg of latest three (P28\u2013P30) = 279.7 and 5-period avg = 257.2; last period spike to 357 suggests momentum but high variance advises partial regression. (4) Forecast logic: blend recent momentum and short-run average, weighted toward latest three periods while conservatively regressing from the P30 spike.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
(1) Historical pattern summary: Past training demands = [161,145,179,196,186] show modest variability around ~173. Test-phase observed demands vary widely with low mid-year troughs (Periods 20\u201325) and large spikes from Period 26 onward. (2) Seasonal/calendar considerations: Current date 2019-09-16 is early autumn when demand for womens blazers typically rises (back-to-work/seasonal layering, pre-autumn wardrobe). No major holiday in mid-September but retail seasonality supports higher blazer demand. (3) Recent trend analysis: Strong upward regime established from Period 26 (2019-08-05) continuing through Period 31 (2019-09-09). Recent six-period avg (Periods 26\u201331) = 269 units; recent 3-period avg (Periods 29\u201331) = 305 units, indicating elevated sustained demand. (4) Final forecast logic: Weight recent 3-period average more heavily due to persistent elevation and seasonality; produce a near-term forecast aligned with recent momentum.

Carry-over insight: Upward regime sustained from Period 26 (2019-08-05) through Period 31 (2019-09-09): 6-period avg (Periods 26\u201331) = 269 units vs prior 3-period baseline (Periods 23\u201325) = 92.3, change +191% (sustained over 6 consecutive periods).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
(1) Historical summary: training demands [161,145,179,196,186] show moderate levels; test-phase series exhibits volatility with a pronounced low in late July (Periods 24\u201325) and a sharp, sustained increase beginning Period 26. (2) Seasonal/calendar: current date 2019-09-23 is early autumn\u2014womens tailored blazers see higher demand heading into fall and back-to-work season, supporting elevated demand. (3) Recent trend: strong upward regime since Period 26 (2019-08-05) with last 3 periods (30\u201332) = 357, 328, 341 (3-period avg = 342); overall Periods 26\u201332 avg = 279 vs prior baseline (Periods 23\u201325) = 92.3, indicating a sustained uplift. (4) Forecast logic: weight recent 3-period average heavily while acknowledging regime stability and seasonal support => forecast near recent mean.

Carry-over insight: Upward regime extended: Period 26 (2019-08-05) through Period 32 (2019-09-16): 7-period avg = 279 vs prior 3-period baseline (Periods 23\u201325) = 92.3, change +202% (sustained over 7 consecutive periods).

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
(1) Historical pattern summary: Past training demands: [161,145,179,196,186] show moderate variability around ~173. Test-phase observed wide swings with low midsummer values (Periods 20\u201325 avg ~91) and a strong upward regime emerging from Period 26 onward (Periods 26\u201332 avg ~279; Period 33 spike to 612). (2) Seasonal/calendar considerations: Current date 2019-09-30 \u2014 start of autumn/return-to-work and tailoring season favors increased demand for blazers; no major holiday this week but retail season ramps in Sept/Oct. (3) Recent trend analysis: Last 4 periods show strong recent demand: 357, 328, 341, 612 \u2014 mean 409.5, median ~349; the last period (612) is an extreme spike but overall recent baseline is markedly above prior months, indicating elevated regime. (4) Final forecast logic: Weight recent periods heavily but partially temper the Period 33 outlier by using the 4-period mean rounded to nearest integer as the next-period forecast.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
(1) Historical pattern summary: Periods 26\u201333 show a sustained upward regime vs prior baseline (already captured in carry-over). Recent observed demands: P30=357, P31=328, P32=341, P33=612, P34=313. (2) Seasonal/calendar considerations: Current date 2019-10-07\u2014start of autumn/fall wardrobe buying; blazers are seasonally relevant, supporting elevated demand vs summer. No major holiday this week to cause a one-off spike. Back-to-work/fall assortment replenishment commonly raises demand in early Sep\u2013Oct. (3) Recent trend analysis: Strong elevated regime since Aug persists; P33 was a large spike (612) likely an outlier/promotion; surrounding values (P30\u2013P34) average ~390 with median ~341. Short-term momentum receding from the spike to ~300s. (4) Final forecast logic: Combine sustained higher-regime baseline (~340) with recent mean uplift while damping the P33 spike; produce a conservative near-term forecast reflecting seasonality and recent pullback.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
(1) Historical summary: Training demands = [161,145,179,196,186] show moderate variability around ~173. Test-phase observed demands exhibit a clear low mid-year trough (Periods 20\u201325) and a pronounced upward regime beginning Period 26. (2) Seasonal/calendar: Current date 2019-10-14 is early autumn \u2014 blazers are seasonally relevant as temperatures cool and retail seasonal assortment shifts to Fall; retail promotions (Autumn collections, pre-holiday markdowns later) can sustain demand. No major global holiday this exact week to cause a spike. (3) Recent trend: From Period 26 (2019-08-05) onward demand has been elevated and relatively sustained: Periods 26\u201335 average = 316.3 with last 3 periods (Periods 33\u201335) = [612,313,283] averaging 403.0 but 612 is an outlier; last 3-week median ~313 and 10-week avg ~316. (4) Forecast logic: weight recent sustained elevated regime and seasonal relevance, dampen impact of the 612 outlier by using recent 3\u201310 period central tendency. Predict a slightly conservative value near the 10-period average adjusted downward from the outlier-driven short-term mean.

Carry-over insight: Upward regime extended: Period 26 (2019-08-05) through Period 35 (2019-10-07): 10-period avg = 316.3 vs prior 3-period baseline (Periods 23\u201325) = 92.3, change +242% (sustained over 10 consecutive periods).

LLM Rationale:
(1) Historical summary: demand jumped from low summer levels (Periods 20\u201325 avg ~93) to a sustained high regime from Period 26 onward (many periods >200). (2) Seasonal/calendar: Current date 2019-10-21 is early autumn \u2014 blazers are in-season but no major holiday spike expected this week. (3) Recent trend: Periods 26\u201336 display a sustained elevated regime; last 6 periods (31\u201336) = [328,341,612,313,283,282], 6-period avg \u2248 360, median \u2248 321. Period 26\u201335 10-period avg previously noted \u2248316.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
(1) Historical summary: demand moved from low mid-year values (~100s) into a sustained high regime starting Period 26; 12-period avg (P26\u2013P37) = 313.2 with recent 3-period avg (P35\u2013P37) = 292.7. (2) Seasonal/calendar: late October (current date 2019-10-28) has no major immediate spike drivers; main retail peaks (Black Friday/Cyber) occur in late November. Blazer demand is higher in autumn, consistent with the recent elevated regime. (3) Recent trend: after a large spike at P33 (612), values stabilized around ~280\u2013360; last 3 weeks show modest uptick to ~293. No evidence of a new regime change. (4) Forecast logic: blend the 12-period elevated regime mean (313) with the 3-period recent mean (293), weighted toward recent stability, yielding a rounded next-period demand near 305.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
(1) Historical summary: Early periods show low-to-moderate demand (Periods 1\u201325 mean ~148 with volatility); from Period 26 onward there is a clear sustained high-demand regime. (2) Seasonal/calendar: Current date 2019-11-04 is in autumn/early holiday retail ramp; blazers are relevant for cooler weather and promotional activity leading into Nov/Dec, which supports sustained elevated demand. (3) Recent trend: Periods 26\u201338 show consistently high demand with short-term stability; recent 4-period average (Periods 35\u201338) = (283+282+313+385)/4 = 315.8, no sharp decline. (4) Forecast logic: weight recent observations and the sustained elevated regime; use recent 4-period average rounded to integer.

Carry-over insight: Upward regime sustained from Period 26 (2019-08-05) through Period 38 (2019-10-28): 13-period avg = 318.7 vs prior 3-period baseline (Periods 23\u201325) = 92.3, change +245% (sustained over 13 consecutive periods).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
(1) Historical summary: Seen a clear upward regime beginning Period 26 sustained through Period 38 with elevated averages (~318 over 13 periods) versus prior baseline (~92). Recent observation: Period 39 dropped to 231 from 385 (Period 38). (2) Seasonal/calendar: Blazer is autumn/winter relevant; elevated demand through Sep\u2013Oct is consistent with fall season and early promotional activity around back-to-school and early fall. Nov 11 falls into fall season but post-peak early-Nov could see normalization. (3) Recent trend: Last 3 periods (Periods 37\u201339) average = 309.7; last 6 periods (Periods 34\u201339) average = 301.2. Period 39 shows a one-period pullback from very high Period 38. No clear new sustained regime change. (4) Forecast logic: Use recent 3\u20136 period average, downweight the single high spike and the latest pullback; produce a conservative round forecast near the recent mean ~301 -> 300.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
(1) Historical pattern summary: after low summer dip (Periods 20\u201325) demand rose sharply from Period 26 onward with a prolonged high-demand regime through Period 38; recent periods remain elevated vs summer baseline. (2) Seasonal/calendar considerations: current date 2019-11-18 is mid-November approaching Black Friday/holiday season which tends to support sustained or slightly higher demand for women's blazers. (3) Recent trend analysis: last 5 periods = [282,313,385,231,278], 3-period avg (Periods 38\u201340) = 298, 5-period avg = 298; no clear new regime shift, just normal fluctuation around ~298. (4) Final forecast logic: weight recent observations (3\u20135 period average) and apply slight positive seasonal bias; forecast set to nearest integer of recent average.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
(1) Historical pattern summary: Demand ranged widely with a clear low-summer trough (~63\u2013120 in Jul) and a strong upward regime emerging from Period 26 (Aug) with multi-period elevated averages (~318 recent long-run avg). Recent 3-periods (Periods 39\u201341) average = 251. (2) Seasonal/calendar considerations: Current date 2019-11-25 sits in late-November (pre-Black Friday / holiday season) when apparel demand often rises modestly for womens tailoring; a small uplift vs immediate history is plausible. (3) Recent trend analysis: Last three observations 231, 278, 245 show no clear directional shift\u2014stable around 250 with moderate volatility. No new sustained regime change detected. (4) Final forecast logic: Base on recent 3-period average (\u2248251) adjusted upward modestly for holiday/Black Friday tailwind (~+10%) while remaining conservative given volatility => predicted demand rounded to 275.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
(1) Historical summary: recent long-run elevated regime from Period 26 onward with typical weekly demand mostly between ~230\u2013385, but occasional large spikes (Period 33=612, Period 42=733). (2) Seasonal/calendar: Period 42 (2019-11-25) aligns with Black Friday week causing an anomalous promotional spike; early December (Period 43, 2019-12-02) typically remains strong for holiday shopping but usually below the Black Friday peak. (3) Recent trend: prior three non-spike weeks (Periods 39\u201341) averaged 251 units; the single-period spike to 733 is not a sustained regime change. (4) Forecast logic: treat Period 42 as a promotional outlier and revert toward recent post-regime baseline, with modest uplift for holiday season. Weighted expectation around 250\u2013320, forecast conservatively at 300 units.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
(1) Historical summary: recent observed demands show an elevated regime from Period 26\u201338 (strong Sep\u2013Oct performance, many weeks 280\u2013385) followed by volatile Nov\u2013Dec with a large spike at Period 42 (733). (2) Seasonal/calendar: Period 42 (2019-11-25) aligns with Black Friday/Cyber Week causing a one-off surge; early December (Period 44) typically returns toward baseline with some uplift for holiday shopping but not as extreme as Black Friday. (3) Recent trend: last non-spike weeks (Periods 39\u201341) average ~251; the most recent week (Period 43) dropped to 169 after the spike, indicating reversion toward baseline but with short-term weakness. (4) Forecast logic: treat the 733 at Period 42 as a single promotional spike and weight recent weeks more heavily (Periods 40,41,43 avg \u2248 230.7). Blend this with the nearby baseline (~250) but conservatively favor the recent lower outcome => predict 231 units for Period 44.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
(1) Historical pattern summary: long-run series shows low-mid hundreds with multiple regime shifts; recent months (Periods 26\u201338 onward) sustained higher demand vs mid-year lows. (2) Seasonal/calendar considerations: current date 2019-12-16 is in pre-Christmas shopping window\u2014demand for womens blazers can be modestly elevated; recent Black Friday spike (2019-11-25 Period 42 = 733) is a one-off promotional outlier. (3) Recent trend analysis: last three non-outlier observations (Periods 41\u201344 = 245, 169, 304) average ~239; including the Black Friday outlier inflates mean but is not indicative of sustained regime. No multi-period upward regime established post-spike. (4) Final forecast logic: downweight the Nov 25 promotional spike, emphasize most recent 3-week average and slight pre-Christmas uplift, rounding to an integer.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
(1) Historical pattern summary: past test-period demands show considerable volatility with a sustained high regime from Period 26\u201339 (avg ~319) and mixed values since then; recent 5 periods = [733,169,304,258] (Periods 42\u201345), 3-period recent avg (P43\u2013P45) = 243.7. (2) Seasonal/calendar considerations: 2019-12-23 is the week before Christmas \u2014 modest uplift for womens tailored blazers is plausible for holiday events, but recent series shows one large promotional spike (Period 42) rather than consistent holiday increases. (3) Recent trend analysis: last three observations (169 -> 304 -> 258) show stabilization around mid-200s with no sustained new regime. (4) Final forecast logic: weight recent 3-period average (243.7) and apply slight holiday uplift (+~10%) while remaining conservative due to volatility => round to nearest integer.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
(1) Historical pattern summary: Training/test history shows baseline demand between ~120\u2013320 with multiple regime shifts: a large sustained upward regime Aug\u2013Nov 2019 and isolated promotional spikes (e.g., Period 42 = 733). Recent 6-months show higher volatility with intermittent spikes. (2) Seasonal/calendar considerations: Current date 2019-12-30 sits between Christmas and New Year; apparel demand typically softens post-Christmas except for returns/exchanges; Black Friday (Period 42) produced a one-off spike in late Nov. (3) Recent trend analysis: Last 3 observed periods (2019-12-09 to 2019-12-23) show a consecutive decline 304 -> 258 -> 128, indicating a short-term downward move after mid-Dec activity. (4) Final forecast logic: Weight recent periods more heavily and adjust downward for post-Christmas softening and absence of promotional events. Combining the sharp recent decline and seasonal lull leads to a conservative next-period forecast around 120 units.

Carry-over insight: Downward trend since Period 44 (2019-12-09) to Period 46 (2019-12-23): demand declined 304 -> 258 -> 128 (-57.9%) over 3 consecutive periods; 3-period avg = 230.
