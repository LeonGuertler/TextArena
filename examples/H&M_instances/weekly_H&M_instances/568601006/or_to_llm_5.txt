Realities & decision: on-hand=0, in-transit=0, and promised lead time is 4 (so any order placed now will only arrive in Period 5), so we cannot affect Period 1 demand. The OR cap already reflects a trade-off between service and holding cost; holding cost is high ($1/unit/period) relative to profit ($2), so aggressive pre-building to the uncapped base_stock (\u2248887) risks large multi-period holding costs if demand doesn't materialize.

OR recommended 425 (uses promised L and historical samples), but its capped policy and base-stock math imply a much smaller incremental order: base_stock \u2248 887, so order_raw \u2248 887 \u2212 698 \u2248 189; OR's cap (single-period mean + 1.645\xd7sd) \u2248 207 further limits aggressive ordering. Given confirmed LT=4, high holding cost ($1/period) vs profit ($2), and desire to restore 5-period coverage without excess inventory, I place an order to top pipeline to ~867.
