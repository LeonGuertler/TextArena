OR recommends 278 based on historical series, but recent weeks show a sustained high-demand regime (Periods 27\u201341 frequently 200\u2013360 sold) and an extreme spike on 2019/11/25 (Period 42 demand=733, sales capped by stock =266). With profit $2 and holding $1, the critical fractile favors stocking more to capture incremental profit; the cost of under-stocking (lost $2 margin per unit) exceeds holding cost $1 if demand materializes. Given very high volatility and the recent 733 spike during the holiday window (late Nov), I increase OR's recommendation to provide substantial buffer while still moderate vs. the spike.
