Inventory & demand analysis: on-hand = 211, in-transit = 0, so available before next demand = 211. Recent sustained demand regime (carry-over insight confirmed at Period 34) shows a high-demand regime with mean \u2248 373.8 units over Periods 29\u201333; multiple subsequent periods have large demand spikes (e.g., Periods 30\u201336 and 39\u201343). With lead time = 0 we should target enough inventory to cover one-period demand plus safety stock. OR recommended 116 (uses older assumptions) which is well below the recent high-demand regime. Profit/Holding: profit = $4, holding = $1 \u2192 critical fractile q=0.8 (z\u22480.84) increases safety stock but with same-period arrivals we prioritize meeting demand to avoid lost sales. Calculation: target one-period demand \u2248 374 (use recent confirmed regime average). Required order = target \u2212 on-hand = 374 \u2212 211 = 163 (min 0). Final strategy: increase OR's 116 to 163 to bring on-hand up to the recent high-demand target and avoid stockouts, while accepting modest holding cost because lead time = 0 and avoiding lost profit from stockouts is more valuable.",
