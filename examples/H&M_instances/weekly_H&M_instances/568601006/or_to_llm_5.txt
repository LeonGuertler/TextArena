{
  "rationale": "Observed facts: on-hand=0, in-transit=1646. Carry-over evidence (Period 5) confirms actual lead time = 1 period. Recent demand regime is elevated (Periods 30\u201346 show sustained high single-period demand ~300\u2013733) so two-period demand (current + next, since L=1) could be on the order of ~700\u2013900 units. With in-transit=1646 >> estimated 2-period demand, placing no new order avoids unnecessary holding cost while still covering expected demand and allowing for some variability. OR recommended 0; I agree and do not override because pipeline already provides ample coverage given the inferred lead time and high recent demand.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "No order: in-transit=1646 and confirmed actual lead time=1 give ample coverage for ~2 future periods of elevated demand (~700\u2013900), so ordering would unnecessarily raise holding costs.",
