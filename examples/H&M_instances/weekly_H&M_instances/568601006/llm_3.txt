  "rationale": "a) World/calendar: Date 2019-02-11 \u2014 late winter in northern hemisphere; blazers are seasonally relevant as transitional layering ahead of spring; no major spike event on 2019-02-11 (Valentine's Day on 2/14 may slightly boost apparel gifting but impact on a tailored women's blazer is limited). b) Demand regime: Historical unified samples for SKU 568601006 = [161,145,179,196,186]; mean \u2248173 units/period with moderate variability (stdev \u224818). No recent within-game data to suggest a regime shift. c) Lead time/missing orders: Supplier promised lead_time=0 but actual lead_time is unknown; no concluded arrivals exist to confirm. Because promised is 0, orders may arrive same period, but risk of longer actual lead time or lost shipments exists. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, in-transit=0. With no pipeline, current period sales can only occur if orders arrive during this period (i.e., actual lead_time=0). e) Final order logic: To capture expected demand while limiting overstock given high holding cost (Holding=$1 = 50% of Profit=$2 per unit per period), place an order equal to the period demand forecast (mean \u2248173). This balances upside if same-period arrival occurs versus holding cost exposure. If arrivals are delayed, we will infer lead_time from conclude messages and adjust future orders.",
