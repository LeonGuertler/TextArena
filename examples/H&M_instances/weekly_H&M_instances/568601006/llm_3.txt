Demand regime & history: lead time confirmed 0 (consistent arrivals each period). Recent demand: P44=304, P45=258, P46=128 \u2014 volatile but last observed period shows a drop (likely post-holiday lull). On-hand=172, in-transit=0. Forecast: near-term demand likely <= on-hand (conservative estimate ~120\u2013180 units). Risk tradeoff: profit $4/unit vs holding $1/unit; excess stock yields immediate holding penalty. With zero lead time we can top-up within the same period if needed, but given arrivals occur after decision, rely on current on-hand to cover expected demand. Action logic: avoid overstock before likely post-holiday lull; hold current inventory to meet demand and minimize holding cost. Order zero this period.",
