No in-period history to suggest a regime shift. c) Lead time / missing orders: Supplier promised LT=0. No concluded arrivals exist to contradict this; assume promised LT until evidence to the contrary. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, in-transit=0. With LT=0 the order placed now should arrive in-period and be available for Period 1 demand. e) Order logic: Target expected period demand \u2248173. Holding cost $1 vs. profit $4 \u2192 avoid large overstock; use mean demand as order quantity (no extra safety stock because no evidence of increased variability or LT delay).

Period 1 observed demand=227 with stockout (sold 173, unmet demand likely \u224854).

With lead_time=0, an order placed now will arrive in-period and can satisfy Period 2 demand. e) Order logic: Given high realized demand in P1 (227) versus historical avg \u2248173, prioritize filling demand to capture $4 profit/unit. Holding cost is $1/unit/period, so avoid large overstock.

  "rationale": "World/calendar: Period date 2019-12-30 (year-end holidays). Product is a women\u2019s blazer (seasonally steady for fall/winter). Demand regime: historical sustained elevated regime since P30 (avg \u2248390) but recent 5-periods show high volatility: [733,169,304,258,128] (5-pt avg=318; recent 3-pt avg=230). Lead time: confirmed 0 (arrivals same period historically). Inventory & pipeline: on-hand=172, in-transit=0. Forecast/decision: balance service vs holding cost ($4 profit/unit vs $1 holding/unit/period). Target a coverage level around 350 units on-hand to cover near-term uncertain demand (~300) while limiting holding cost. Order = 350 - 172 = 178 units.",
