Lead time & pipeline: most recent confirmed evidence (carry-over) shows actual lead time = 3 periods; some orders previously arrived with LT=2 but evidence is mixed \u2014 assume LT=3 until 3+ consistent periods show change. Decision logic: must cover (L+1)=4 upcoming weeks of demand. Forecast 4-week demand \u2248 366*4 = 1,464 units. Current on-hand = 0, in-transit = 1,387 \u2192 expected shortfall \u2248 77 units. Small safety buffer for holiday variability -> order 80 units. This keeps service while limiting holding cost given high holding=$1/unit/period and per-unit profit $4.",

======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "World & product: SKU is a womens tailored blazer near year-end (12/30). Holiday shopping just passed; demand historically elevated in Sep\u2013Oct but recent weeks show mixed volumes. Demand analysis: recent demands P43\u2013P46 = [169,304,258,128], 4-week avg \u2248215 units/week. Given historical baseline (~173) and prior high-season spikes, use recent avg as short-term forecast. Lead time & pipeline: recent conclude messages show multiple 3-period lead time observations (P30->P33, P32->P35, P34->P37, P43->P46), so assume actual lead time = 3 periods; some earlier 1\u20132 period occurrences and lost orders were observed but recent evidence supports L=3. Inventory assessment: on-hand=632, in-transit=707 \u2192 total supply = 1,339 units in pipeline. Required coverage (L+1=4 periods) \u22484 \xd7 215 = 860 units. With total supply >> 860, no additional order needed now. Ordering risk: placing new orders with L=3 risks overstock and holding cost ($1/unit/period) given uncertain post-holiday demand. Decision: place zero order to avoid excess holding cost while current pipeline suffices to meet forecasted demand and preserve profit margin.",
