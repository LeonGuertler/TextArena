Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Product is a women's blazer with steady past demands [161,145,179,196,186]. On-hand=0 and in-transit=0; no concluded arrivals to suggest lead-time deviations or lost shipments. No clear changepoint in demand; use promised lead time and population stats so OR backend computes base-stock balancing profit ($2) vs holding ($1). Selected methods: L=default to use promised 2-period lead time; mu_hat=default to use (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples); sigma_hat=default to use sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/2/18 (Period 2). Recent demand history shows stable demand samples [161,145,179,196,186] with mean ~173.4. On-hand=0, in-transit=207 (order placed Period 1 not yet concluded), so cannot infer actual lead time; treat promised lead time as binding. Use default lead time to let backend assume promised L=2. Use default mu_hat ( (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples = 3\xd7173.4 ) to reflect multi-period demand over review+lead and avoid overreacting to a single unconfirmed missing arrival. Use default sigma_hat (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) to represent observed variability. This balances service level (covers ~L+1 periods expected demand) against holding cost while acknowledging in-transit stock may or may not arrive.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/2/25. Historical demands: [161,145,179,196,186] (mean=173.4, std\u224820.4). No concluded arrivals yet for orders placed in Periods 1\u20132, so actual lead time is unobserved; use promised lead time. On-hand=0, in-transit=437 (orders from P1+P2) which is below (1+L)*mean \u2248 520, so pipeline likely insufficient to cover the review+lead demand (3 periods). Chosen methods: L=default to respect promise and because conclude messages do not yet show actual lead time; mu_hat=default to use full-sample mean scaled by (1+L); sigma_hat=default to use full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances service (use full-sample estimate) while remaining cautious about holding cost by not inflating variance or mean without evidence of regime change.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/4. Demand history (seed) = [161,145,179,196,186], mean ~173.4. Game concludes show orders placed in Periods 1-3 did not arrive (arrived=0), despite promised L=2 \u2014 indicating shipments are delayed or lost. Current on-hand=0, in-transit=626 (but no concluded arrivals so pipeline is unreliable). To protect service while acknowledging unreliable shipments, I explicitly increase lead time to reflect prolonged/unknown delays. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default (use full-sample mean and std scaled by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L)) so the OR backend computes demand across the longer review+lead period consistently. This raises target base-stock to cover extra periods given the inferred longer lead time and balances profit vs. holding cost by letting the OR engine compute safety stock via q=profit/(profit+holding).

Carry-over insight: Observed missing arrivals for orders placed in Periods 1-3 (concluded arrived=0) \u2014 treat shipments as delayed/lost; adopt extended lead-time regime until concluded arrivals demonstrate normal lead-time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $378.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. Historical demand mean = 173.4 (samples [161,145,179,196,186]). Concluded arrivals show one observed lead time: order on Period 3 arrived in Period 4 \u2192 observed lead_time = 1. Periods 1-3 had missing arrivals until Period 4, indicating delayed/lost shipments but recent conclude suggests actual lead time \u22481. In-transit = 705 units is large; on-hand =0. I choose L="calculate" so backend uses the average of observed lead times (1) to adapt to the recent observed short lead time while still allowing backend to detect variability. Use mu_hat default to anchor demand forecast to all samples scaled by (1+L) for stability given limited data. Use sigma_hat default to let backend compute volatility from all samples. This balances service (use observed shorter lead time) against holding cost given large in-transit and uncertain past delays.

Carry-over insight: Period 4: Observed missing arrivals for orders placed in Periods 1-3 (concluded arrived=0) \u2014 treat shipments as delayed/lost; adopt extended lead-time regime until concluded arrivals demonstrate normal lead-time.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. On-hand=53, in-transit=437. Historical demands=[161,145,179,196,186], mean=173.4. Concluded arrivals show lead_time=1 for orders (Period3->arrived in P4, Period4->arrived in P5) so use observed average lead time. Choose L via 'calculate' (average observed =1). Use mu_hat 'default' to set (1+L)*mean(all samples) = 2*173.4 (backend computes). Use sigma_hat 'default' so backend scales std by sqrt(1+L). This reconciles recent concluded short lead-times while the large in-transit pipeline protects against earlier delays/lost shipments; default demand estimates keep service level aligned with profit/holding tradeoff.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time appears to be 1 period based on concluded arrivals: Period4 concluded arrived=189 (ordered P3, lead_time=1); Period5 concluded arrived=268 (ordered P4, lead_time=1). Retire prior extended lead-time regime until further concluded evidence.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). On-hand=0, in-transit=437. Concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 1 (Period4: P3->1; Period5: P4->1); retire extended lead-time regime. Use L="calculate" to reflect observed lead-time average=1. Demand history (seed samples) mean=173.4; use default mu_hat=(1+L)\xd7mean to keep backend forecast anchored to full-sample mean and avoid overreacting to short-term noise. Use default sigma_hat to reflect historical volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). Pipeline (437) currently exceeds the (1+L)-period demand forecast, so no aggressive upward adjustment needed; parameters balance service level vs holding cost.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). Recent concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 1 (Period4 arrived=189 ordered P3, lead_time=1; Period5 arrived=268 ordered P4, lead_time=1). On-hand=0, in-transit=437 \u2014 pipeline already exceeds a 1-period coverage forecast. I set L explicit=1 to reflect observed lead-time regime (override promised 2). I use mu_hat default and sigma_hat default so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history; with L=1 this avoids new orders while the 437 in-transit is likely sufficient and keeps holding cost exposure moderate. Monitor future concluded arrivals for any return to promised lead time or lost shipments.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/8 (Period 9). Recent concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 1 period (Period4 concluded: arrived=189 ordered P3, lead_time=1; Period5 concluded: arrived=268 ordered P4, lead_time=1). On-hand=0, in-transit=437. Set L to be inferred from observed lead times (calculate) so backend uses average observed L=1. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full demand history [161,145,179,196,186]; this balances service level against holding cost given confirmed shorter lead time and available pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Retire extended lead-time regime; observed actual lead time = 1 period based on concluded arrivals: Period4 concluded arrived=189 (ordered P3, lead_time=1); Period5 concluded arrived=268 (ordered P4, lead_time=1).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 10 (2019-04-15). Recent concluded arrivals indicate actual lead time = 1 period (Period4 arrived=189 ordered P3, lead_time=1; Period5 arrived=268 ordered P4, lead_time=1). On-hand=0, in-transit=437 \u2014 this pipeline (437) comfortably covers ~2 periods of expected demand given historical mean (~173 units). No evidence of extended delays currently; use inferred short lead time to let OR backend target (1+L)-period coverage. Selected methods: infer L from observed lead times (calculate) to lock in the 1-period actual, and let the backend compute mu_hat and sigma_hat defaults so base-stock uses full historical mean/variance scaled by (1+L).

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). Demand has been volatile but recent observed concluded lead times show consistent 1-period actual lead time (arrived in P4: ordered P3, lead_time=1; arrived in P5: ordered P4, lead_time=1). On-hand=0, in-transit=437 \u2014 pipeline large but arrivals will occur with L\u22481. Set L to calculated average of observed lead times (captures concluded evidence). Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to anchor forecasts to the most recent demand regime while accounting for short-term volatility.

Carry-over insight: Retire extended lead-time regime; actual lead time = 1 period based on concluded arrivals: Period4 arrived=189 (ordered P3, lead_time=1); Period5 arrived=268 (ordered P4, lead_time=1).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/29 (Period 12). On-hand=0, in-transit=437 (these match orders from Periods 1-2 and have not concluded -> likely delayed/lost). Concluded arrivals show consistent recent lead time = 1 period (Period4 concluded: arrived=189 ordered P3, lead_time=1; Period5 concluded: arrived=268 ordered P4, lead_time=1). I therefore set L via recent_N using the two most recent observed lead times (N=2) to reflect the current 1-period regime while acknowledging older in-transit shipments may be lost. For demand I use default aggregation ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) because historical demand samples [161,145,179,196,186] show no strong recent structural shift beyond the lead-time signals. Volatility is set to default (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR backend can compute safety stock given the chosen L. This balances service (short lead-time evidence) against holding cost while noting outstanding in-transit units that may never conclude.

Carry-over insight: Retire extended lead-time regime; actual lead time = 1 period based on concluded arrivals: Period4 concluded arrived=189 (ordered P3, lead_time=1); Period5 concluded arrived=268 (ordered P4, lead_time=1). However, earlier orders (P1,P2) remain missing (in-transit=437) and may be lost/delayed.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/6 (Period 13). On-hand=0, in-transit=437 (likely from early orders P1/P2). Concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 1 period (Period4: arrived=189 ordered P3 lead_time=1; Period5: arrived=268 ordered P4 lead_time=1). Earlier orders (P1,P2) never concluded and may be lost/delayed. Set L to 'calculate' so backend uses observed lead-time history (captures the recent confirmed L=1). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std of all demand samples are applied, giving a conservative forecast based on full history while the lead-time regime has been retired to 1 period. This balances service level (accounting for confirmed shorter lead time) against holding cost given limited on-hand and large in-transit uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Earlier shipments from Periods 1-2 remain missing (in-transit=437) and may be lost; retire prior extended lead-time regime \u2014 concluded evidence shows actual lead time = 1 period (Period4 arrived=189 ordered P3, lead_time=1; Period5 arrived=268 ordered P4, lead_time=1).

Set L to 'calculate' to use the average of observed lead times (captures the inferred 1-period regime). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, balancing the detected shorter lead time against historical demand (conservative given missing earlier shipments). This choice avoids overreacting to missing older shipments while ensuring the base-stock covers current (L+1) periods of demand under the observed 1-period lead time.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/20. Recent concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 1 period (Period4 arrived=189 ordered P3, lead_time=1; Period5 arrived=268 ordered P4, lead_time=1). Earlier orders from Periods 1-2 remain missing (in-transit=437) and may be lost/delayed; continue conservative policy by using inferred average lead time. Set L by calculating average of observed lead times to reflect concluded evidence. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full demand history [161,145,179,196,186], balancing service level against holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/3 (Period 17). Concluded arrivals show consistent 1-period actual lead time (Period4 arrived=189 ordered P3, lead_time=1; Period5 arrived=268 ordered P4, lead_time=1). Several early orders (P1,P2) remain missing and appear lost/in prolonged transit (in-transit=437). Set L to be inferred from observed lead-times (calculate) so the OR engine uses the empirically observed lead time=1. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, keeping forecasts grounded in full-history demand while the lead-time regime is set to the observed 1-period behavior. This balances service level (shorter lead time) against holding cost and acknowledges possible lost early shipments by not inflating demand forecast.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time = 1 period based on concluded arrivals (Period4 arrived=189 ordered P3, lead_time=1; Period5 arrived=268 ordered P4, lead_time=1). Earlier orders from Periods 1-2 remain missing (in-transit=437) and may be lost/delayed.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10 (Period 18). Demand history shows recent demands [161,145,179,196,186] and extended run of zero arrivals after early orders; concluded arrivals in Period4 and Period5 indicate actual lead time = 1 period (Period4 concluded: arrived=189 ordered P3 lead_time=1; Period5 concluded: arrived=268 ordered P4 lead_time=1). On-hand=0, in-transit=437 (earlier P1-P2 shipments remain missing and may be lost). I set L to be calculated from observed concluded lead times to reflect the clear recent 1-period regime. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default (use full-sample mean and std scaled by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L)) so the OR backend uses all demand history while the recalculated L corrects the lead-time assumption; this balances service level (use observed shorter lead time) vs. holding cost given uncertain missing shipments.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time = 1 period based on concluded arrivals: Period4 arrived=189 (ordered P3, lead_time=1); Period5 arrived=268 (ordered P4, lead_time=1). Earlier orders from Periods 1-2 remain missing (in-transit=437) and may be lost/delayed.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). Recent concluded arrivals (Period4 arrived=189 ordered P3, lead_time=1; Period5 arrived=268 ordered P4, lead_time=1) indicate actual lead time = 1 period. On-hand=0, in-transit=437 (earlier orders P1-P2) which have not concluded and may be lost/delayed; do not rely on them for immediate fulfillment. Choose L by averaging observed lead times to reflect concluded evidence of 1-period delivery. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the demand samples, letting the backend balance profit vs holding cost with the updated L. This approach is conservative about missing shipments while leveraging concluded lead-time evidence to reduce unnecessary pipeline cover.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time = 1 period based on concluded arrivals (Period4 arrived=189 ordered P3, lead_time=1; Period5 arrived=268 ordered P4, lead_time=1). Earlier in-transit quantity 437 (orders from Periods 1-2) remains missing and may be lost/delayed.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24 (Period 20). Historical concluded arrivals show consistent actual lead time = 1 period (Period4 arrived=189 ordered P3, lead_time=1; Period5 arrived=268 ordered P4, lead_time=1). On-hand=0, in-transit=437 (orders from P1-P2) remain missing and may be lost. Select L by calculating average of observed lead times (captures the two concluded 1-period observations). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std over all demand samples, maintaining conservative safety stock given the recent confirmed shorter lead time while relying on full historical demand for stability.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time = 1 period based on concluded arrivals (Period4 arrived=189 ordered P3, lead_time=1; Period5 arrived=268 ordered P4, lead_time=1). Earlier in-transit quantity 437 (orders from Periods 1-2) remains missing and may be lost/delayed.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/1 (Period 21). Historical demand samples = [161,145,179,196,186]. Concluded arrivals show consistent actual lead time = 1 period (Period 4 concluded: arrived=189 ordered P3, lead_time=1; Period 5 concluded: arrived=268 ordered P4, lead_time=1). Earlier in-transit quantity 437 (orders from P1-P2) remains missing and may be lost/delayed; do not trust those as future arrivals. Choose L by averaging observed lead times ('calculate') to reflect concluded evidence of 1-period lead time. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from full sample, balancing service level vs holding cost given short lead time and limited data.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time regime changed to 1 period based on concluded arrivals: Period4 arrived=189 (ordered P3, lead_time=1); Period5 arrived=268 (ordered P4, lead_time=1). Earlier in-transit 437 (orders from Periods 1-2) remains missing and may be lost/delayed.

On-hand=0, in-transit=437 (earlier orders P1-P2 remain missing and may be lost/delayed). I set L via 'calculate' to let backend average observed lead times (captures the two confirmed 1-period observations). Demand history mean is ~173.4; using default mu_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean) yields ~346.8 which balances covering this + current period demand; sigma_hat default lets backend scale historical volatility by sqrt(1+L). This approach restores normal 1-period regime while leaving handling of the missing in-transit units to monitoring (do not assume they will conclude).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/15. On-hand=0, in-transit=437 (older orders from P1-2 still missing). Recent concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=1 (Period4 arrived=189 ordered P3, lead_time=1; Period5 arrived=268 ordered P4, lead_time=1). Treat current operational lead-time as 1 period. Choose L via recent_N on the last 2 observed lead-time conclusions (both =1) to capture the confirmed 1-period regime. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples \u2014 conservative pooling given limited demand changepoint evidence and significant missing in-transit quantity. This balances service (short lead-time now) against holding cost while acknowledging possibly lost earlier shipments.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/22 (Period 24). Historical concluded arrivals show consistent 1-period lead time (Period4 arrived=189 ordered P3, lead_time=1; Period5 arrived=268 ordered P4, lead_time=1). On-hand=0, in-transit=437 (earlier orders P1-P2) remain missing and may be lost/delayed; do not assume those will arrive. Set L by calculating observed lead times to reflect actual 1-period regime. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std from demand history, balancing service level against holding costs given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time regime = 1 period based on concluded arrivals (Period4 arrived=189 ordered P3, lead_time=1; Period5 arrived=268 ordered P4, lead_time=1). Earlier in-transit 437 units (orders from Periods 1-2) remain missing and may be lost/delayed.

Historical demand samples = [161,145,179,196,186]; on-hand=0, in-transit=437 (earlier orders P1-P2) likely delayed/lost. Select L using calculate to let backend infer the observed lead-time regime; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing a conservative base-stock that accounts for the 1-period lead-time while the 437 in-transit remains unresolved.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=0, in-transit=437 (likely older missing shipments). Concluded arrivals show consistent actual lead time = 1 period (Period4 arrived=189 ordered P3, lead_time=1; Period5 arrived=268 ordered P4, lead_time=1). Use observed lead-time regime (average of concluded lead times) so backend accounts for faster arrivals than promised. Demand history shows moderate, stable weekly demand; use default demand/stat volatility aggregation so backend uses full sample statistics for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances service (shorter L reduces pipeline requirement) while remaining conservative about demand uncertainty and potential lost in-transit units.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/19 (Period 28). Recent history: long stretch of zero on-hand with continuing demand; on-hand=0, in-transit=437 (orders from P1-P2) likely lost/delayed. Concluded arrivals show consistent 1-period lead time: Period 4 concluded arrived=189 (ordered P3, lead_time=1) and Period 5 concluded arrived=268 (ordered P4, lead_time=1). No strong evidence of a persistent demand regime change, so use inferred actual lead time from concluded data and let backend compute demand aggregation using all samples. Choices: L set to calculated average of observed lead times (captures actual =1); mu_hat default to let backend compute (1+L)*mean(all samples); sigma_hat default to let backend compute sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This balances service level (uses observed shorter lead time) while avoiding overreaction to missing earlier in-transit units that appear lost.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead-time regime = 1 period based on concluded arrivals (Period4 arrived=189 ordered P3, lead_time=1; Period5 arrived=268 ordered P4, lead_time=1). Earlier in-transit 437 units (orders from Periods 1-2) remain missing and may be lost/delayed.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:

Date 2019/8/26 (Period 29). Historical concluded arrivals show consistent actual lead time = 1 period (Period4 arrived=189 ordered P3, lead_time=1; Period5 arrived=268 ordered P4, lead_time=1). Earlier in-transit quantity 437 (orders from Periods 1-2) remains missing and may be lost/delayed. Given concluded evidence, set lead-time estimate to the calculated average of observed lead times (reflecting the 1-period regime). Use default demand/volatility aggregation ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to let the OR engine compute base-stock balancing profit vs holding cost under the inferred L.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time regime = 1 period based on concluded arrivals: Period4 arrived=189 (ordered P3, lead_time=1); Period5 arrived=268 (ordered P4, lead_time=1). Earlier in-transit 437 units (orders from Periods 1-2) remain missing and may be lost/delayed.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/9 (Period 31). On-hand=0, in-transit=437 from very early orders (Periods 1-2) that have not concluded and may be lost. Concluded arrival history consistently shows actual lead time = 1 period (Period4 concluded: arrived=189 ordered P3, lead_time=1; Period5 concluded: arrived=268 ordered P4, lead_time=1). Therefore I set L to be inferred from observed lead times. Demand history shows no recent upward regime shift that isn't seasonal noise; use default demand estimates (backend (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std) so the optimizer uses full sample stats adjusted for inferred L. This approach treats the stuck 437 as likely lost (will remain in-transit) while aligning ordering policy to the observed 1-period lead time to restore service quickly without overstocking.

On-hand=0, in-transit=437 (earlier orders P1-P2) remain missing and may be lost/delayed; treat them as unavailable when planning. Set L by calculating average of observed lead times to capture the demonstrated 1-period regime; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (all-sample mean/std scaled by 1+L) so the OR backend computes base stock from full demand history while reflecting the inferred lead time.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/23 (Period 33). Recent realized demand has jumped (Periods 28-32: 251,231,357,328,341) vs earlier samples; on-hand=0, in-transit=437 (orders from Periods 1-2) remain missing and may be lost/delayed. Concluded arrivals indicate actual lead time = 1 period (Period4 arrived=189 ordered P3, lead_time=1; Period5 arrived=268 ordered P4, lead_time=1). Therefore set L by calculating observed lead times to reflect the 1-period regime. To capture the recent higher demand regime, estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent 5 demand samples (N=5) so the OR engine targets a base stock that covers the current elevated demand (while acknowledging missing in-transit may be lost).

Carry-over insight: Actual lead-time regime = 1 period based on concluded arrivals (Period4 arrived=189 ordered P3, lead_time=1; Period5 arrived=268 ordered P4, lead_time=1). Earlier in-transit 437 units (orders from Periods 1-2) remain missing and may be lost/delayed.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/30 (Period 34). Recent concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 1 period (Period4 concluded: arrived=189 ordered P3, lead_time=1; Period5 concluded: arrived=268 ordered P4, lead_time=1). On-hand=0, in-transit=638 \u2014 earlier shipments remain missing and may be lost/delayed. Set L by calculating observed lead times to reflect concluded evidence of L=1. Demand has stepped up recently (large demands in recent weeks, e.g. Period33 demand=612) so use an EWMA for mu_hat to overweight recent high demand (gamma=0.5). Keep sigma_hat default (uses all samples) so OR backend captures overall volatility. These choices balance higher short-term demand risk while aligning lead-time estimate with concluded arrivals and acknowledging missing in-transit stock.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead-time regime = 1 period based on concluded arrivals (Period4 arrived=189 ordered P3, lead_time=1; Period5 arrived=268 ordered P4, lead_time=1). Earlier in-transit shipments remain missing and may be lost/delayed (current in-transit=638).

Demand has recently increased sharply (several high demands including 612, 357, 341, 328, 313), so use a recent demand window to capture the elevated regime. Set L to be calculated from observed lead times (reflecting observed lead_time=1). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the recent high-demand regime and higher volatility; this balances service with holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time = 1 period based on multiple concluded arrivals (P4 arrived=189 ordered P3, P5 arrived=268 ordered P4, P34 arrived=201 ordered P33). Earlier in-transit shipments remain missing and may be lost/delayed (current in-transit=798).

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). Concluded arrivals show consistent 1-period actual lead time (arrivals from orders on P3->P4, P33->P34, etc.). On-hand=0, in-transit=857 with many earlier orders missing\u2014treat those as likely lost/delayed. Set L by calculating average observed lead times to reflect empirical 1-period regime; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of samples) so the OR backend computes base stock from full-sample demand statistics while respecting the inferred shorter lead time. This balances service level (responding to recent 1-period arrivals) against holding cost given zero on-hand and large uncertain in-transit.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time regime = 1 period based on multiple concluded arrivals (e.g. P4 arrived=189 ordered P3, P5 arrived=268 ordered P4, P34 arrived=201 ordered P33). Earlier in-transit shipments remain missing and may be lost/delayed (current in-transit=857).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=0, in-transit=857 with many earlier shipments never concluding; recent concluded arrivals show consistent 1-period actual lead time (Period4 arrived=189 ordered P3, lead_time=1; Period5 arrived=268 ordered P4, lead_time=1; Period34 arrived=201 ordered P33, lead_time=1). Given this concluded evidence, set lead-time estimate via calculate (avg observed lead times=1). Use default demand/volatility aggregation so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples; this keeps forecasts grounded in full history while the L change addresses observed timely arrivals. Flag missing in-transit volume as potential lost/delayed shipments but do not adjust demand stats explicitly.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead-time regime = 1 period based on multiple concluded arrivals: Period4 arrived=189 (ordered P3, lead_time=1); Period5 arrived=268 (ordered P4, lead_time=1); Period34 arrived=201 (ordered P33, lead_time=1).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=48, in-transit=496. Concluded arrivals show mostly 1-period lead times (orders: P3\u2192arrived P4, P4\u2192P5, P33\u2192P34) but a recent late conclude (order P34 arrived in P37 => lead_time=3) introduces volatility. To balance service vs holding cost I set L using a recent average to capture this short-term shift while keeping demand stats based on full history. Methods: L=recent_N (N=3) to average the last 3 observed lead times (captures the 1/1/3 pattern); mu_hat=default so backend uses (1+L)*mean(all samples); sigma_hat=default so backend uses sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This approach adapts lead-time estimate to recent variability while relying on full-sample demand stats to avoid overreacting to one demand spike.

Carry-over insight: Recent lead-time volatility: mostly 1-period arrivals but a late arrival with lead_time=3 observed (order P34\u2192arrived P37). Use short-window lead-time average until further concluded evidence.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/4 (Period 39). Recent concluded arrivals show predominantly 1-period lead time with one late arrival (lead_time=3); earlier shipments remain missing/in-transit and may be lost (in-transit=496). To balance service vs holding cost, I use a short-window lead-time estimate to adapt quickly to the recent 1-period regime while allowing the OR backend to inflate mu/sigma using the chosen L. Methods: L set via recent_N (N=3) to capture recent short-window average lead-time; mu_hat and sigma_hat left as default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples.

Carry-over insight: Recent lead-time regime: mostly 1-period arrivals with occasional late (lead_time=3) \u2014 use short-window lead-time averaging until further concluded evidence; earlier in-transit shipments remain missing and may be lost (in-transit high).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=0, in-transit=496 (earlier in-transit shipments remain missing and may be lost/delayed). Recent concluded lead-times: mostly 1 period but a late 3-period arrival observed (order P34\u2192arrived P37) \u2014 short-window averaging is appropriate. Demand has stepped up since Period 33 (612) with elevated weekly demand thereafter; use a recent-window forecast to capture the higher recent demand regime. Therefore: set L via recent_N (short window N=3) to reflect recent lead-time volatility; set mu_hat via recent_N N=6 to capture the post-Period33 higher demand regime; set sigma_hat via recent_N N=6 to capture recent demand volatility. These choices bias orders toward meeting the recent higher demand while keeping lead-time estimate responsive to late arrivals and avoiding overcommitment given missing in-transit units.

Carry-over insight: Recent lead-time regime: mostly 1-period arrivals with occasional late 3-period arrival (evidence: P34\u2192arrived P37, plus many 1-period concludes); earlier in-transit shipments remain missing and may be lost (current in-transit=496).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=0, in-transit=634 (large outstanding, likely contains some lost/delayed early shipments). Concluded lead-time evidence shows mostly 1-period arrivals with occasional 3-period late arrival (evidence: P3\u2192P4=1, P4\u2192P5=1, P33\u2192P34=1, P34\u2192P37=3). Use a short-window lead-time average to capture recent 1- vs 3-period volatility while not over-weighting early missing shipments. Use default demand/volatility aggregators so backend applies (1+L) scaling to historical demand; this balances service vs holding cost given moderate profit/holding ratio and large in-transit uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Recent lead-time regime: mostly 1-period arrivals with occasional 3-period late arrivals (evidence: P3\u2192P4=1; P4\u2192P5=1; P33\u2192P34=1; P34\u2192P37=3). Earlier in-transit shipments remain missing and may be lost/delayed (in-transit high).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). Recent concluded arrivals show a short lead-time regime dominated by 1-period arrivals (evidence: P3\u2192P4=1, P4\u2192P5=1, P33\u2192P34=1) with occasional late 3-period arrival (evidence: P34\u2192P37=3). Large outstanding in-transit balance (634) likely includes lost/delayed earlier shipments. To balance service vs. holding cost I use a short-window lead-time estimate to react quickly to 1-period behavior while keeping demand forecasts based on recent demand to capture late-season demand increases. Methods chosen: L recent_N (N=3) to average recent lead-time volatility; mu_hat recent_N (N=5) to forecast (1+L)\xd7mean of most recent demand samples; sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to capture recent demand volatility. This keeps orders responsive to the prevailing mostly-1-period arrivals while not overreacting to isolated 3-period delays and flags that early in-transit units may be lost.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime: mostly 1 period with occasional 3-period late arrival (evidence: P3\u2192P4=1; P4\u2192P5=1; P33\u2192P34=1; P34\u2192P37=3). Earlier in-transit volume remains high (in-transit=634) and may represent lost/delayed shipments.

Concluded arrivals show mostly 1-period lead time with occasional 3-period late arrival (evidence: P4\u2190P3=1; P5\u2190P4=1; P34\u2190P33=1; P37\u2190P34=3). Use a short-window lead-time average to remain responsive to recent volatility while not assuming long delays. Set L via recent_N=3 (captures last 3 observed lead times: 1,1,3). Forecast demand across review+lead using recent_N=5 (use the 5 recent demand samples provided) to reflect current demand level. Keep sigma_hat default so backend scales volatility with chosen L. This balances service level (short L average to cover frequent 1-period arrivals plus occasional 3-period risk) against holding cost given high in-transit uncertainty.

LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). On-hand=0, in-transit=825 (many earlier shipments remain missing/lost). Concluded lead-time history shows mostly 1-period arrivals with occasional 3-period late arrival (evidence: P3\u2192P4=1, P4\u2192P5=1, P33\u2192P34=1, P34\u2192P37=3). Use short-window lead-time averaging to reflect recent 1-with-occasional-3 regime. Demand has been volatile with recent high peaks (late-period demand spikes e.g. periods with 313\u2013733); use a recent-demand window to capture current elevated demand. These settings bias orders upward to cover (1+L) review+lead demand and the observed volatility while acknowledging high in-transit uncertainty (will avoid trusting very old in-transit as guaranteed).

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16 (Period 45). Recent concluded arrivals show a short lead-time regime dominated by 1-period arrivals with occasional 3-period lateness (evidence: P3\u2192P4=1, P4\u2192P5=1, P33\u2192P34=1, P34\u2192P37=3). In-transit volume is very high (825) and earlier shipments have been delayed/lost historically; continue using a short-window lead-time estimate to respond to recent volatility. For demand I use an EWMA to emphasize strong recent demand spikes (late-season/holiday demand visible in Nov\u2013Dec). Sigma uses a short recent window to capture current volatility. These choices bias orders toward meeting high recent demand while keeping safety stock responsive to occasional longer delays.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime: mostly 1 period with occasional 3-period late arrivals (evidence: P3\u2192P4=1; P4\u2192P5=1; P33\u2192P34=1; P34\u2192P37=3). Large persistent in-transit volume (825) \u2014 earlier shipments may be delayed/lost.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/23 (Period 46). On-hand=0, in-transit=825 (large, likely includes lost/delayed earlier shipments). Concluded arrivals show a dominant 1-period lead time with occasional 3-period lateness (evidence: multiple concluded pairs P3->P4=1, P4->P5=1, P33->P34=1, P34->P37=3). Recent demand shows a late-year spike (e.g. Period42 demand=733 and elevated Nov\u2013Dec demands), so forecast should weight recent observations more. To balance service vs holding cost: use a short-window average for lead time to reflect recent 1-or-3 variability; use EWMA for mu_hat to emphasize recent high demand while tempering noise; use a short-window sigma estimate to capture recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime: mostly 1 period with occasional 3-period late arrivals (evidence: P3->P4=1; P4->P5=1; P33->P34=1; P34->P37=3). Large persistent in-transit volume (825) \u2014 earlier shipments may be delayed or lost. Late-year demand spike observed (Nov\u2013Dec), plan for higher demand in current period.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/30. Demand context: late-year (Nov\u2013Dec) spike observed; historical samples limited but recent concluded arrivals show mostly 1-period lead times with occasional 3-period late arrivals. On-hand=63, in-transit=634 (large persistent in-transit; some earlier shipments likely lost). Choose a short-window lead-time estimate to reflect recent 1-or-3 variability, use EWMA for mu_hat to upweight recent high Dec demand, and use recent std for sigma_hat to capture current volatility. These settings increase target base-stock to protect service during the holiday spike while keeping sigma driven by recent variability to avoid excessive safety stock for long-lost shipments.
