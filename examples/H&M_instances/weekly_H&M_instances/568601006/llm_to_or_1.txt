Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11 (pre-spring); product is a women's blazer\u2014no clear calendar spike now. No on-hand or in-transit inventory and no concluded arrivals to suggest lead-time issues. Historical demands: [161,145,179,196,186] show no recent regime shift (mean ~173.4, std ~18.23). Use promised lead time (default) and population-based estimates: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean, sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std. This balances service (z* for q=2/(2+1)=0.6667) against holding cost without overstocking given no evidence of lost shipments or demand change.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent conclude (Period 1) shows orders placed arrived within same period (lead_time=0). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 and prior period sold out (demand 227 > ordered 183) indicating stockout but no evidence of lead-time drift. No calendar events imminent. Use default/empirical estimates: keep L at promised 0, set mu_hat to the (1+L)*mean of historical demands (mean of [161,145,179,196,186]=173.4) to reflect typical demand, and sigma_hat to sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples)=18.23 to capture observed variability. This balances service (avoid frequent stockouts) against holding cost by using the OR engine's default base-stock anchoring.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Context: Period 3 (2019-02-25). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Concluded history shows two same-period arrivals (Period1 and Period2 arrivals with lead_time=0). Historical sample demands = [161,145,179,196,186] (mean=173.4, std\u224818.23). Recent concluded demands (Period1=227, Period2=284) are noticeably above the historical mean but are only two observations; shipments have arrived on-time so far (actual lead time=0). Decision: keep L at promised (default 0) because concluded data consistently shows lead_time=0. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat based on all historical samples (conservative baseline) to avoid overreacting to two high recent demands; this balances service level vs holding cost given limited evidence of a sustained regime change. On-hand + pipeline =0 so orders placed will target the computed base-stock level.

Carry-over insight: Recent demand spike: concluded demands in Period1=227 and Period2=284 exceed historical mean 173.4 \u2014 possible upward shift; monitor for confirmation.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent concluded demands show a clear short-term uptick (Periods 1-3 demands = 227, 284, 198). All concluded arrivals indicate actual lead time = 0 (orders in Periods 1-3 arrived same period). To respond to the apparent upward demand regime while avoiding overcommitment, I use a recent-window forecast (last 3 periods) for mean and volatility and set lead time to the observed average (0). This raises the base-stock demand forecast to reflect the higher recent sales while keeping sigma to capture elevated variability; it supports higher service (reduce lost sales) without extreme inventory given holding cost=$1 and profit=$2.

Carry-over insight: Recent upward demand regime confirmed: last 3 concluded demands (227, 284, 198) average 236.33 \u2013 treat as current demand level until further evidence.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. Recent concluded demands show an elevated regime vs historical mean (recent 4 avg=230.75 vs historic ~173). No in-transit stock and on-hand=42; last orders have arrived with lead_time=0 consistently. I set L by averaging observed lead times (all concluded lead_times=0). For demand I use a recent_N forecast (N=4) to capture the confirmed higher demand regime (periods 1-4 demands = 227,284,198,214; mean=230.75). Volatility uses the same recent_N (std of these 4 samples = 37.42). These parameters raise the base-stock to meet the higher short-term demand while keeping sigma realistic to avoid excessive safety stock given holding cost.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. Recent demand regime elevated vs original historical samples: concluded demands in Periods 1-5 = [227,284,198,214,215], mean=227.6. All observed lead times = 0 (orders in Periods 1-5 arrived same period), so use L=0. On-hand=32, in-transit=0 \u2192 pipeline low relative to elevated demand; set demand forecast using recent 5-period regime to capture the confirmed upward shift. Chosen methods: L=calculate (average observed lead times = 0) to reflect consistently zero actual lead time; mu_hat=recent_N with N=5 \u2192 (1+L)*mean(last5)=227.6 to target service under higher demand; sigma_hat=recent_N with N=5 \u2192 sqrt(1+L)*std(last5)=29.67 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters raise the base-stock to serve the higher demand while keeping holding cost in mind given modest on-hand inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $403.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-03-25. All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (orders on Periods 1-6 arrived same period). On-hand=27, in-transit=0; recent demands have shifted up from historical mean (~173) to ~225. Use recent demand regime to avoid stockouts while keeping holding cost in mind. Set L as the average of observed lead times (0). Use recent_N=5 (most recent 5 concluded demands: 284,198,214,215,215) to capture the new higher mean and variance. This raises mu_hat to cover the (1+L) review+lead window at the new demand level; sigma_hat uses the same recent_N to reflect current volatility so OR backend sets an appropriate base-stock and cap.

Carry-over insight: Upward demand regime confirmed: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 2-6) = [284,198,214,215,215], mean=225.2, std\u224833.66; treat this as current demand level until contradicted.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. On-hand=54, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead-times all 0 \u2192 use L=0. Recent demand regime has softened vs prior spike: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 3-7 = [198,214,215,215,186]) mean=205.6, std\u224813.12; use this as (1+L)-period demand forecast. With profit=$2 and holding=$1, service-level q = 2/(2+1)=0.6667 but OR backend will compute z; supplying mu_hat and sigma_hat based on recent 5 keeps orders aligned to the most recent demand level while avoiding overstock from earlier extreme spikes. This will prompt an order to replenish toward ~205.6 demand while holding moderate safety via reported sigma.

Carry-over insight: Recent slight softening vs prior high-demand regime: last 5 concluded demands mean=205.6 (Periods 3-7) vs earlier 5-period mean=225.2 (Periods 2-6); treat 205.6 as current demand level until contradicted.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent concluded demands show a sustained higher regime vs original historical samples. All concluded lead-times = 0 \u2192 use average observed lead time = 0. Use recent_N demand estimate (N=5, last 5 concluded demands Periods 4\u20138 = [214,215,215,186,249]) to capture the current level without over-weighting older low samples. mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_recent = 215.8. sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std_recent \u2248 19.97. This raises the base-stock to protect service given higher realized demand while keeping L=0 to reflect reliable same-period arrivals.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/15. Concluded history shows consistent same-period arrivals (all conclude messages report lead_time=0) and recent demand has settled below the earlier spike but above the long-run historical baseline. I set L to promised (0) because all concluded shipments show lead_time=0. I use a recent_N demand estimate (N=5, Periods 5-9 demands = [215,215,186,249,178], mean=208.6) to capture the current regime. Volatility is estimated from the same 5-sample window (std\u224825.14). These parameters keep target stock aligned to the recent demand level while reflecting current variability to balance service vs holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Recent demand regime: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 5-9) = [215,215,186,249,178], mean=208.6, std\u224825.14; treat ~208.6 as current demand level until contradicted.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/22. Recent history shows reliable 0-period actual lead time (every concluded arrival had lead_time=0). On-hand=91, in-transit=0 so no incoming stock visible; current cover is limited. Demand has softened versus the prior high regime: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 6\u201310) = [215,186,249,178,130], mean=191.6, std\u224839.63. I set L by averaging observed lead times (0) to reflect consistent same-period arrivals. I set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current lower demand level (mu_hat=(1+L)*mean=191.6). I set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect current volatility (sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std\u224839.63). These parameters reduce excess holding by lowering the base-stock toward the recent realized demand level while keeping safety buffer for observed variability.

Carry-over insight: Recent demand softening: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 6\u201310) mean=191.6, std\u224839.63 (evidence: [215,186,249,178,130]); treat ~191.6 as current demand level until contradicted.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29. All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 (orders placed each period arrived same period) so use observed lead time=0. Recent demand has softened vs earlier high regime: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 7\u201311 = [186,249,178,130,127]) average 174.0 with std \u224849.82; on-hand=84, in-transit=0. Set L based on observed lead times=0. Set mu_hat to (1+L)*mean of last 5 = 174.0 to target current one-period demand; set sigma_hat to sqrt(1+L)*std(last 5)=49.82 to reflect elevated volatility. These parameters aim to cover one period of expected demand while avoiding excess holding given recent softening.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/6 (Period 13). History shows all concluded orders had lead_time=0 consistently. Recent demand has softened: the last 5 concluded demands (Periods 8\u201312 = [249,178,130,127,191]) average 175 with elevated volatility. On-hand=5, in-transit=0 so we need to restock to cover upcoming (L+1)=1 period of expected demand. I set L to the observed average lead time (0). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent 5 concluded demands to reflect the current softened regime (N=5) so the OR base-stock is responsive to the lower recent mean but still accounts for higher variance.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/13. On-hand=37, in-transit=0. All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 consistently (Periods 1\u201313), so use promised/default L=0. Recent evidence shows demand has softened vs earlier spikes; last 5 concluded demands (Periods 9\u201313 = [178,130,127,191,160]) average 157.2 with std\u224828.45. To capture the recent regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) so the OR backend targets current demand levels and avoids excess holding while maintaining service.

Carry-over insight: Recent demand softened further: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 9\u201313) = [178,130,127,191,160], mean=157.2, std\u224828.45; treat ~157.2 as current demand level until contradicted.

Recent demand has softened vs earlier spikes; last 5 concluded demands (Periods 10\u201314 = [130,127,191,160,196]) average 160.8 with sample std \u224832.57. I set L to promised (0) and use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the latest regime while keeping responsiveness to further shifts. This keeps base-stock focused on the current lower-demand regime (reducing overstock risk) while sigma captures remaining variability to maintain service.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-06-03. All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 historically (orders in prior periods always arrived same-period), no lost shipments. Recent concluded demands (Periods 12\u201316 = [191,160,196,143,168]) show a softened regime vs earlier spikes; I use a recent-N estimate (N=5) to capture the current level while remaining responsive. Set L=default (promised lead time 0). Set mu_hat = (1+L)*mean of last 5 concluded demands = 171.6 to target service at the near-term observed demand. Set sigma_hat from the same 5-sample regime (sample std \u2248 22.01) to reflect current volatility. This keeps orders responsive to the recent softening while relying on consistent same-period lead time history.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/10 (Period 18). On-hand=64, in-transit=0. All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 historically (orders in Periods 1\u201317 concluded with lead_time 0) so use promised lead time. Recent demand has softened: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 13\u201317) = [160,196,143,168,118], mean=157.0, std\u224829.01 \u2014 consistent with prior insight (Period 14 softening). I set L=promised (0). I set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the current lower-demand regime: mu_hat=(1+L)*mean_last5=157.0. I set sigma_hat using recent_N=5: sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std_last5\u224829.01.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Context: Period 19. On-hand=31, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=0 in all concluded periods \u2192 no evidence of shipments lost or lead-time drift. Recent demand has softened; last 5 concluded demands (Periods 14\u201318 = [196,143,168,118,139]) average 152.8 with std \u224830. I choose L using promised lead time (method=default, value=0) because all concluded messages show lead_time=0. For demand I use recent_N with N=5 (the most recent regime length) to capture the current softened level: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_last5 = 152.8. For sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=5: sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std_last5 \u2248 29.99. This keeps target base-stock and caps responsive to the lower recent demand while preserving service given low pipeline and modest on-hand stock.

Carry-over insight: Lead time remains 0 periods (evidence: every concluded order to Period 18 arrived with lead_time=0); recent demand softened: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 14\u201318) mean=152.8, std\u224830 \u2014 treat ~153 demand level as current until contradicted.

Historical concludes (Periods 1\u201319) show consistent same-day arrivals (lead_time=0 every concluded order) and recent moderate-soft demand\u2014no new calendar shocks. I therefore keep L at the promised/observed 0. Use full-sample estimates for demand because no strong, new changepoint after Period 19: mean demand (Periods1\u201319)=182.105, sample std\u224846.05. These parameters let the OR engine compute a baseline base-stock that balances profit ($2) vs holding ($1) using entire history while keeping safety stock responsive to observed variability.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/1. Historical concludes show every order arrived with lead_time=0 -> keep L=0. Recent demand has softened sharply: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 16\u201320) = [168,118,139,122,73], mean=124.0, std\u224834.64. On-hand=126, in-transit=0 so current stock roughly covers ~1 period at this recent rate; to avoid excess holding given holding cost=$1 vs profit=$2, I use a recent-5 demand estimate (captures the latest downshift) and matching recent volatility. These parameters (L=0, mu_hat based on recent-5 mean, sigma_hat based on recent-5 std) steer the OR backend to a modest base-stock that balances service with holding cost after the clear demand softening.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed 0 periods (every concluded order showed lead_time=0); recent demand softened: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 16\u201320) mean=124.0, std\u224834.64 \u2014 treat ~124 demand level as current until contradicted.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-08. Historical concluded lead_times all 0 -> keep L=0. Recent demand has softened; last 5 concluded demands (Periods 17\u201321 = [118,139,122,73,116]) average 113.6, std \u224824.44. On-hand=23, in-transit=0 so current coverage is very low vs one-period demand. I use recent_N=5 to capture the latest softened regime (avoid overweighting earlier higher spikes). Setting mu_hat=(1+L)*recent_mean and sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*recent_std gives the OR engine a low, current demand forecast and realistic volatility so orders will replenish to meet one-period demand while avoiding excess holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Lead time remains 0 (evidence: every concluded order to Period 21 arrived with lead_time=0); recent demand softened further: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 17\u201321) mean=113.6, std\u224824.44 \u2014 treat ~114 demand level as current until contradicted.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/15. Recent concluded lead-times all show 0 (Periods 1\u201322), so keep L=0. Recent demand has softened: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 18\u201322) = [139,122,73,116,120], mean=114.0, std\u224824.55 \u2014 treat as current regime. On-hand=5, in-transit=0 so pipeline is low; set forecasts to cover (1+L) periods = 1 period of demand using recent-5 to be responsive to the soft demand and avoid excess holding cost. This reduces service risk modestly while limiting holding cost given profit=$2 vs holding=$1 (q=0.667 implies moderate service level).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/22. Product: Mariette Blazer (seasonal relevance moderate). Historical concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 for all past orders -> keep L=0. Recent demand has softened sharply: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 19\u201323 = [122,73,116,120,120]) mean=110.2, std\u224820.91; I detect a new low-demand regime and use recent_N=5 to estimate demand for the review+lead period (1+L=1). On-hand=5, in-transit=0, so target mu_hat\u2248110.2 balances service vs holding given profit=$2 and holding=$1 (q=2/(2+1)=0.666), sigma_hat set from recent sample to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Recent demand softened to new regime: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 19\u201323) mean=110.2, std\u224820.91; treat ~110 demand level as current until contradicted.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/29 (Period 25). All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 consistently. On-hand=57, in-transit=0; recent demand has softened. I use the most recent 5 concluded demands (Periods 20\u201324 = [73,116,120,120,63], mean=98.4, std\u224828.02) as the current demand regime. Set L to the observed average lead time (0) to reflect reliable same-period arrivals. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets ~1-period demand at the current lower demand level and reduces excess holding while maintaining service. This balances profit vs holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05. Recent concluded demands show a softened regime vs earlier periods; last 5 concluded demands (Periods 21\u201325) = [116,120,120,63,94], mean=102.6, std\u224824.64. All concluded orders to date have lead_time=0. On-hand=17, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. I set L to promised (0) because concluded history consistently shows 0 lead time. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the current softened demand regime (mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_recent; sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std_recent). These parameters reduce target base-stock to match lower recent demand and limit holding cost given holding=$1/unit vs profit=$2/unit.

Carry-over insight: Lead time remains 0 periods (evidence: every concluded order shows lead_time=0). Recent demand softened: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 21\u201325) mean=102.6, std\u224824.64 \u2014 treat ~103 demand level as current until contradicted.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (summer). Recent concluded history shows lead_time consistently 0 (every concluded order arrived same period). Demand has softened vs earlier months; last 5 concluded demands (Periods 22\u201326 = [120,120,63,94,146]) average 108.6 with std \u224831.03, so I treat this as the current demand regime. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we need orders to meet (1+L) periods of demand. I set L using the promised/default (0) because concluded arrivals confirm lead_time=0. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the current softened regime (more responsive than all-sample averages). These parameters give the OR backend a forecasted demand over the review+lead window and an empirical volatility to size safety stock while avoiding excess holding cost in a low-demand period.

Carry-over insight: Lead time remains 0 periods (evidence: all concluded orders arrived with lead_time=0); recent demand regime softened: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 22\u201326) mean=108.6, std\u224831.03 \u2014 treat ~109 demand level as current until contradicted.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/19 P28. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. All concluded orders show lead_time=0 \u2192 use L=0 (calculate over observed lead times). Recent large realized demand in Period27=301 (stock-limited sales) suggests a potential regime shift; to be robust vs outlier but responsive, I use recent_N=5 demand samples (Periods23\u201327) which average 144.8 and std\u224892.63. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat from these recent 5 samples keeps the OR base-stock responsive to the recent spike while the high sigma raises safety stock to cover volatility. This balances service (capture unmet demand) against holding cost given profit=$2 vs holding=$1.

Carry-over insight: New large realized demand in Period27: demand=301 (Periods23\u201327 last-5 mean=144.8, std\u224892.63). Treat as potential uptick but volatile; monitor next periods for confirmation.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/26 (Period 29). All concluded orders to date show lead_time=0 (consistent through Period 28). Recent demand is volatile (large spikes Periods 27\u201328) but overall mean of observed demands (Periods 1\u201328) = 169.4286. No evidence of lost shipments. Use promised lead time (0) and default demand estimators to let OR backend combine historical mean/variance with its service-level cap logic. This balances service (captures recent high-variance spikes via full-sample std) against holding cost.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/2. All concluded orders show lead_time=0. Recent volatility with three large demands (Periods 27\u201329 = 301, 251, 231) suggests an upward shift vs prior soft regime. I set L=promised (0) since concluded history confirms same-day arrivals. For demand I use recent_N (N=5, Periods 25\u201329 = [94,146,301,251,231]) to capture the apparent uptick while preserving responsiveness; (1+L)*mean_recent = 204.6. I set sigma_hat from the same recent window (sample std \u2248 74.6) to reflect increased volatility. These choices raise the base-stock to cover the new higher mean and wider variability while keeping lead-time conservative at 0 to avoid over-ordering for assumed delays.

Carry-over insight: New confirmed uptick: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 25\u201329) mean=204.6, std\u224874.6; treat ~205 demand level and elevated volatility as current until contradicted.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/9 (Period 31). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times = 0 every period \u2014 keep L=0. Recent demand shows a clear uptick: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 26\u201330) = [146,301,251,231,357], mean=257.2, elevated volatility (std\u224879.0). I treat this as the current demand regime for the review+lead period and use a recent_N estimate (N=5) so OR base-stock targets the higher level while capturing higher uncertainty to avoid stockouts given zero observed lead time.

Carry-over insight: Recent sustained demand uptick: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 26\u201330) mean=257.2, std\u224879.0; treat ~257 demand level and elevated volatility as current until contradicted.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
All concluded orders show lead_time=0; recent demand has jumped sharply (last 5 concluded demands = [301,251,231,357,328], mean=293.6, elevated volatility). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must stock to meet current high-demand regime. Set L based on observed lead times (average=0). Set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the new high-demand level (1+L)*mean_recent. Set sigma_hat using recent_N=5 (sqrt(1+L)*std_recent) to reflect elevated volatility and let OR backend compute base-stock with appropriate service target.

Carry-over insight: New confirmed demand uptick: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 27\u201331) mean=293.6, std\u224846.9 \u2014 treat ~294 demand level and elevated volatility as current until contradicted.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-23 (Period 33). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent data show a confirmed demand uptick: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 28\u201332) = [251,231,357,328,341], mean=301.6, std\u224850.72. Lead time history continues to show lead_time=0 for all concluded orders. I set L to the promised/default 0 (evidence: all concluded orders show 0). I set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the new high-demand regime: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last5) = 301.6. I set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect elevated volatility: sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(last5) \u2248 50.72. These choices ensure the OR engine targets a base-stock appropriate for the new high-demand level while using recent volatility to size safety stock, keeping holding costs mindful by not using older, lower-demand data.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand uptick: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 28\u201332) mean=301.6, std\u224850.7; treat ~302 demand level and elevated volatility as current until contradicted.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/30. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 every period through Period 33. Recent demand shows a strong upward shift: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 29\u201333) = [231,357,328,341,612], mean=373.8, high volatility std\u2248142.0. I set L=default (promised 0) because all concluded orders show lead_time=0. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the new high-demand regime and elevated uncertainty (so the OR backend's base-stock reflects higher mean demand while sigma captures volatility). This balances service level (avoid stockouts during the surge) against holding cost by relying on a short lead time and capping orders in the OR engine.

Carry-over insight: New confirmed demand uptick: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 29\u201333) mean=373.8, std\u2248142.0; treat ~374 demand level with elevated volatility as current until contradicted.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/10/07 (Period 35). All concluded orders show lead_time=0 (every concluded message has lead_time=0) so use L=promised (0). Recent periods show a confirmed, large demand uptick: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 30\u201334) = [357, 328, 341, 612, 313], mean=390.2 and high volatility (std\u2248125.06). I set mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture the new elevated demand regime (forecast covers review+lead = 1 period). Sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=5) to reflect elevated demand dispersion. These parameters raise the base-stock to meet much higher current demand while sigma_hat captures uncertainty to avoid excessive stockouts; keeping L=0 is consistent with observed arrivals and avoids overestimating pipeline.

Carry-over insight: New confirmed demand uptick: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 30\u201334) mean=390.2, std\u2248125.06; treat ~390 demand level with elevated volatility as current until contradicted.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/10/14 (Period 36). On-hand=162, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistent lead_time=0 and a recent strong demand uptick (Periods 31\u201335 demands = [328,341,612,313,283]). I set L=default (promised 0) because all concluded orders show lead_time=0. For demand I choose recent_N=5 to capture the current high-demand regime: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last5) = 375.4 units; sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(last5) = 134.0 units. This raises the base-stock to meet the current elevated demand while recognizing high volatility to avoid stockouts; keeping L=0 avoids inflating pipeline given no evidence of delays.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed 0 periods (all concluded orders). New sustained high-demand regime: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 31\u201335) mean=375.4, std\u2248134.0; treat ~375 demand and elevated volatility as current until contradicted.

Use a recent_N demand estimate to capture current elevated level and volatility. On-hand=152, in-transit=0 \u2014 order needed to replenish to the base-stock implied by this high-demand regime. Chosen parameters will raise target inventory to meet the confirmed uptick while accounting for higher demand variability.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). On-hand=114, in-transit=0. Lead time has been consistently 0 in all concluded messages through Period 37. Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 33\u201337) = [612,313,283,282,313], mean=360.6 and std\u2248126.47. To respond to the confirmed uptick and elevated volatility while promised L=0 remains valid, I use L=0 and set demand forecasts using the recent 5-period regime (captures the new level/volatility and avoids dilution by older low-demand periods). This raises the base-stock target to reflect current demand spikes and higher uncertainty, improving service (sales/profit) at the expense of higher holding \u2014 appropriate given profit>holding and recent lost sales when stock was exhausted.

Carry-over insight: Lead time remains 0 periods (evidence: every concluded order through Period 37 arrived with lead_time=0). New sustained high-demand regime: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 33\u201337) mean=360.6, std\u2248126.47; treat ~361 demand level and elevated volatility as current until contradicted.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/4 (Period 39). On-hand=37, in-transit=0. All concluded orders through Period 38 show lead_time=0, so use L=0. Recent periods (Periods 34\u201338) show a sustained high-demand regime; use recent_N (N=5) to capture current mean and elevated but stable volatility. mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last5)=315.2 to target ~315 units cover for the period; sigma_hat = std(last5)=41.88 to reflect observed variability. This balances service (high recent demand) against holding cost given limited on-hand inventory and zero pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed 0 periods (all concluded orders through Period 38). New sustained high-demand regime: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 34\u201338) mean=315.2, std\u224841.88.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

All concluded orders show lead_time=0. On-hand=103, in-transit=0 \u2192 limited pipeline. To balance service vs holding cost given profit=$2/hold=$1 (q\u22480.667, z*\u22480.43) I use a short recent-window forecast so the base-stock reflects the new high-demand level while keeping safety stock proportional to observed volatility. This aims to prevent stockouts in the immediate high-demand regime without creating excessive long-term holding cost.

Date 2019/11/18 (Period 41). On-hand=46, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead time = 0 for all arrivals. Recent demand shows sustained high, volatile demand: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 36\u201340) = [282,313,385,231,278], mean=297.8, std\u224856.9. I set L to promised (0) because concluded history confirms same-period arrivals. I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand regime and elevated volatility so the OR backend raises the base-stock (improving fill) while the higher sigma increases safety stock accounting for variability.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/25. Lead time evidence: every concluded order through Period 41 arrived with lead_time=0. Recent demand regime: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 37\u201341) = [313,385,231,278,245], mean=290.4, elevated volatility. On-hand=78, in-transit=0 \u2014 pipeline is effectively zero so we must replenish to cover next period's demand. I set L=0 (confirmed by concluded arrivals). I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the clear, sustained high-demand regime (changepoint around Periods 30\u201337). mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_recent = 290.4 units (one-period demand forecast). sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std_recent \u2248 55.14 to reflect elevated volatility. These parameters raise the base-stock to meet higher demand while the sigma preserves safety stock vs. stockouts; using recent data avoids diluting the uptick with older low-demand samples.

Carry-over insight: Lead time remains 0 periods (all concluded orders through Period 41). New sustained high-demand regime: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 37\u201341) mean=290.4, std\u224855.14; treat ~290 demand and elevated volatility as current until contradicted.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/2 (Period 43). Lead time evidence: every concluded order through Period 42 shows lead_time=0. Recent demand: large uptick in the most recent periods (Periods 38\u201342 demands = [385,231,278,245,733]) \u2014 last-5 mean=374.4 and high volatility (std\u2248209.4). I set L to promised (0) consistent with all concluded arrivals. I choose mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the new high-demand regime and elevated variance so the OR engine raises the base-stock and cap appropriately to avoid stockouts during this spike while accepting higher holding cost risk. This balances high unit profit ($2) against $1 holding cost by targeting a higher service level given recent realized demand.

Carry-over insight: New sustained high-demand regime: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 38\u201342) mean=374.4, std\u2248209.4 \u2014 treat ~374 demand level with elevated volatility as current until contradicted.

Daily Reward (R_t): $42.00

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09 (Period 44). Historical concludes show lead time consistently 0; I'll keep L=0. Recent concluded demands (Periods 39\u201343 = [231,278,245,733,169]) show a strong uptick with high volatility; use a recent_N=5 estimate so the OR base-stock reflects current elevated mean and risk. On-hand=296, in-transit=0 (pipeline=296) \u2014 this covers ~0.89\xd7 the recent-period mean (331.2), so ordering should top up toward the higher recent demand to avoid stockouts while accepting higher holding cost given high profit/hazard tradeoff.

Carry-over insight: Lead time remains 0 periods (all concluded orders). New recent demand regime: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 39\u201343) mean=331.2, std\u2248228.1; treat as current elevated demand level with high volatility until contradicted.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16 (Period 45). On-hand=126, in-transit=0. All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 so treat L=0. Recent demand is in a high, volatile regime: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 40\u201344) = [278,245,733,169,304], mean=345.8, elevated sample std\u2248222.3. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat from these last-5 samples so the OR engine raises target stock to meet current high demand while acknowledging high volatility. This keeps service high (captures uplift) but sigma increases safety stock to limit stockouts; keeping L=0 matches observed confirmations and avoids inflating pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Lead time remains 0 (all concluded orders). New recent high-demand regime: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 40\u201344) mean\u2248345.8, sample std\u2248222.3; treat as current elevated demand with high volatility until contradicted.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30 (Period 47). On-hand=311, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times all show 0 \u2014 keep L=0. Recent demand spike and high volatility: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 42\u201346) = [733,169,304,258,128], mean=318.4, sample std\u2248242.0. I set L by recent_N (N=5) to capture current regime. I set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) = (1+L)*mean = 318.4 to reflect the elevated short-term demand level. I set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) = sqrt(1+L)*sample_std \u2248 242.0 to reflect current high volatility. This raises the base-stock target and safety stock to avoid stockouts given recent large spikes, while noting on-hand=311 will partially cover expected demand this period.

Carry-over insight: Lead time remains 0 (all concluded orders). New recent high-demand regime: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 42\u201346) mean=318.4, sample std\u2248242.0; treat as current elevated demand level with high volatility until contradicted.
