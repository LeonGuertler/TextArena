Demand regime: recent carry-over notes show a sustained elevated regime since Periods 34\u201338 (avg ~315/day). Recent 5-period demands (P40\u2013P44) = [278,245,733,169,304], mean \u2248346 but includes a large Black-Friday spike (733); a conservative baseline ~320\u2013340 is reasonable. Lead time: confirmed as 4 periods from history (P1\u2192P5 etc.). Decision timing: when ordering in Period 45, shipments will arrive in Period 49 (4-period LT) and only be observed in Period 50; current period demand (and next 4) will be met from on-hand + existing in-transit. Inventory/pipeline: on-hand = 227, in-transit = 1200 \u2192 total coverage \u22481427 units. Required coverage for (L+1)=5 periods at baseline 320 \u22481600 units \u2192 short \u2248173 units. Holding vs profit: Profit $4/unit, holding $1/unit/period \u2014 avoid large excess given holding cost. Action: top up to cover estimated 5-period shortfall with modest safety buffer. Order 200 units to mitigate shortage while limiting holding cost.",

Lead time: confirmed as 4 periods from history. Inventory/pipeline: on-hand=219 + in-transit=1150 = 1369 units available (arrivals scheduled per concluded history); need coverage for L+1=5 periods.
