No recent periods observed to indicate a regime shift. c) Lead time / pipeline: On-hand=0, In-transit=0, no concluded arrivals to infer actual lead time; supplier promised 0 but actual lead time unknown. d) Inventory assessment: Starting from zero, must cover current-period demand (decision happens before arrivals). To avoid immediate stockouts and lost sales, order enough to cover roughly one period of expected demand plus modest safety stock given lead-time uncertainty. Holding cost is $1 vs profit $4 (holding is significant but service is prioritized when starting from zero). e) Final order logic: Order \u2248 mean demand (173) rounded up with small safety margin to 180 units to balance service level and holding cost.",

Recent demands: P42=733 (one-off Black Friday/Promotional spike), P43\u2013P46 = [169,304,258,128] with average ~214. Longer-run regime elevated vs. baseline but current week is after Christmas where demand typically falls. Holding cost = $1/unit vs. profit $4/unit \u2192 holding is costly relative to profit; only units that sell generate net reward. With lead_time=0 we could top up immediately, so no need to pre-build inventory. To maximize expected reward, avoid excess ending inventory and use current on-hand to meet expected demand.
