No evidence yet of a regime shift. c) Lead time / missing orders: supplier promised LT=2. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 and no concluded arrivals to infer an alternate LT or lost orders. Assume promised LT until contradicted. d) Inventory & pipeline: with LT=2, orders placed now will arrive during Period 3.

Round to a practical order quantity of 520 units to cover demand uncertainty while avoiding expected ending inventory.

Inventory & pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=1386 \u2014 substantial pipeline that will likely satisfy many upcoming periods if/when it arrives. Holding vs profit: profit = $2/unit, holding = $1/unit/period \u2014 holding cost is high relative to profit, so excess ending inventory severely reduces reward. Final order logic: do not place a new order now because large in-transit quantity (1386) risks high holding cost if it arrives and demand does not exhaust it quickly; plus lead-time variability means ordering now could overlap arrivals and increase ending inventory. Recommendation: order 0 units this period.",

  "rationale": "World & product: SKU is a women's blazer\u2014demand seasonally high around late Nov\u2013Dec (holiday/party season). Recent demand regime: sustained elevated demand since P27 with many weekly spikes (periods 27\u201345 largely >> historical prior mean 173; recent weeks 43\u201345 = [169,304,258], still elevated vs prior mean). Lead-time & pipeline: supplier promised LT=2 but actual LT variable (observed LT=1,2,3 for different shipments) and earlier P1/P2 shipments are likely lost; current system shows in-transit=1386 units which reflects multiple outstanding shipments. Inventory assessment: on-hand=0, in-transit=1386 >> expected short-term demand. Coverage rule (L+1=3 periods): estimated short-term weekly demand ~250 units \u2192 need ~750 units for 3-period cover; in-transit already exceeds this so additional ordering is unnecessary and would incur extra holding cost (holding $1/period vs profit $2). Final order logic: do not place new order this period and rely on in-transit pipeline to satisfy upcoming demand while avoiding unnecessary holding costs and risk from variable lead-times.",

Lead-time & pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=1386 \u2014 large pipeline; past concludes show variable lead times and some overdue/lost shipments, but current in-transit quantity is available to arrive across upcoming periods.
