Supplier promised lead time = 2 periods, so order must cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand because arrivals occur after decision. No concluded arrivals exist to contradict promised lead time and In-transit=0, so treat lead time as 2 until proven otherwise. Inventory/pipeline: On-hand 0, In-transit 0. Risk: orders can be lost or actual lead time may differ; be somewhat conservative but ensure coverage for 3 periods. Economics: Profit $4/unit >> holding $1/unit/period, so stocking to meet expected demand is profitable. Order calculation: target coverage = 3 periods \xd7 173 \u2248 519 units.
