Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Historical demands: [161,145,179,196,186] (mean ~173). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so current availability is zero and we must cover (L+1) periods of demand. No concluded arrivals visible to infer actual lead time; promised lead time used. To let the OR backend compute base-stock using full-sample demand stats, I choose default methods for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat so mu_hat=(1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This balances service level (using historic mean/variance) against holding cost given modest profit/holding ratio and no evidence of regime change.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent observed demand in Period 1 spiked to 227 vs historical mean ~173.4 (samples [161,145,179,196,186]). On-hand=0, in-transit=207 from an order placed in Period 1 that has not concluded (no observed arrivals yet). No concluded lead-time observations exist, so do not change promised lead time. Use default demand estimates so the OR engine applies (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std; this is conservative given a single spike and allows the backend to compute base stock while accounting for promised L=2.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. On-hand=0, in-transit=437; Period1 and Period2 orders (ordered 207,230) have not concluded (arrived=0) \u2192 possible longer-than-promised lead time or delayed shipments. To be conservative against stockouts, set L explicitly to 3 (one period longer than promised). Demand history samples = [161,145,179,196,186] show no clear recent regime change, so use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend will compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std). This increases target base-stock to cover extra delay while keeping demand estimate stable given limited evidence of demand shift.

Carry-over insight: Suspect extended lead time: orders placed in Period1 and Period2 have not arrived by their conclude messages (evidence of delays/loss); treat lead time as longer-than-promised until concluded arrivals indicate otherwise.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. All three orders placed in Periods 1-3 (207,230,274) have not concluded by their respective conclude messages \u2192 evidence of extended lead time or lost shipments. On-hand=0, in-transit=711 (these units have not concluded). To be conservative, treat lead time longer than promised to cover delayed arrivals and avoid stockouts. I set L explicit=4 (explicitly longer than promised 2) to force the OR engine to plan for a longer pipeline. Demand recently spiked (Period1=227, Period2=284, Period3=198); I use recent_N with N=3 for mu_hat so the (1+L) forecast emphasizes recent elevated demand. sigma_hat uses default to reflect full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). These choices prioritize service (profit per unit > holding cost) given current zero on-hand and evidence of delays.

Carry-over insight: Suspect extended lead time: orders placed in Period1\u2013Period3 have not arrived by their conclude messages; treat lead time as longer-than-promised until concluded arrivals indicate otherwise.

=== Period 4 Summary ===
568601006: ordered=307, arrived=274 units (ordered on Period 3, lead_time was 1 periods), starting on-hand inventory=274, demand=214, sold=214, ending on-hand inventory=60
Daily Profit: $428.00, Daily Holding Cost: $60.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $368.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). Recent concluded arrival: Period 4 conclude shows arrived=274 (ordered Period 3) \u21d2 observed lead_time=1 for that shipment. Earlier Period1\u20132 orders have no concluded arrivals and may have been lost or delayed, but we now have at least one observed lead-time=1. On-hand=60, in-transit=744 \u2014 pipeline is large relative to demand. Choose L by averaging observed lead times to reflect actual recent behavior (calculate). Use default demand estimates (mu_hat and sigma_hat) based on all samples to smooth noise from a few periods of zero sales and because pipeline is already ample; this balances service level (avoid stockouts if other in-transit arrive) against holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Update: observed lead_time=1 based on Period 4 conclude (ordered Period 3 arrived in Period 4); previous suspected extended delays remain unresolved for Period1\u20132 orders but at least some shipments are arriving with lead_time=1.

Daily Reward (R_t): $278.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019/3/18). On-hand=152, in-transit=437. Concluded arrivals show recent observed lead_times = 1 (Period4: order in P3 arrived in P4; Period5: order in P4 arrived in P5). Earlier orders from Period1\u20132 remain unobserved and may be lost. Choose L by averaging observed lead times to reflect the recent regime (L=1). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) since demand history (5 samples) is stable and calendar/seasonality signals are not strong; this balances service level vs holding cost given moderate profit/holding ratio and substantial pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed recent lead_time=1 based on Period4 and Period5 concludes; Period1\u2013Period2 orders remain missing and may be lost.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period start 2019-03-25 (Period 7). Recent concludes show orders from Periods 3 and 4 arrived with lead_time=1; Periods 1\u20132 remain missing and may be lost. On-hand=0, in-transit=437 (likely includes recent shipments). Demand has shifted to a stable ~214\u2013215 level in the last 3 periods. To reflect confirmed recent lead time and recent demand regime, set lead time estimate from observed concludes and use recent 3-period demand for mu and sigma so the OR engine targets service for the current higher run-rate while avoiding excess stock for possibly lost older shipments.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. Recent concluded arrivals show lead_time=1 (Period4: order P3 arrived with L=1; Period5: order P4 arrived with L=1). However orders placed in Period1\u2013Period2 (207+230=437) remain unconfirmed in concludes and are likely lost/delayed. To address this, set L by averaging the two most recent observed lead times (recent_N, N=2) to reflect the currently confirmed fast regime while not trusting very old missing shipments. Use default demand/volatility formulas so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history, providing a stable forecast given limited data. This balances service (using observed L=1) against holding cost while the missing early shipments remain unresolved.

Carry-over insight: Orders from Period1 (207) and Period2 (230) have not concluded and remain missing; likely lost or severely delayed (evidence: no arrivals for these orders in Period3\u2013Period7 concludes; in-transit shows 437 matching their sum). Recent concluded arrivals (Period4 and Period5) indicate actual lead_time=1 for newer orders.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08 (Period 9). Recent concluded arrivals show lead_time=1 for orders placed in Periods 3 and 4; older orders from Period1\u20132 remain missing. On-hand=0, in-transit=437 (matches sum of missing Period1+2 orders), recent demand has been elevated (last 5 concluded demands: 214,215,215,186,249; mean \u2248 215.8). To reflect the observed actual lead time, set L via observed average lead times. To capture the recent higher-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 demands (N=5). This balances service (covers elevated recent demand) while acknowledging missing/possibly lost early shipments by not inflating lead time beyond observed evidence.

Carry-over insight: Recent actual lead_time=1 based on Period4 and Period5 concludes (ordered P3\u2192arrived P4, ordered P4\u2192arrived P5); orders from Period1 (207) and Period2 (230) remain missing and likely lost (no arrivals in Period3\u2013Period8 concludes; in-transit=437 equals their sum).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15 (Period 10). On-hand=0, in-transit=446. Historical concludes show recent actual lead_time=1 (P3\u2192arrived P4, P4\u2192arrived P5). Orders from P1 (207) and P2 (230) never concluded and in-transit sums to 437 (likely lost); recent small order (9) added makes in-transit=446. Given consistent concluded evidence of L=1 for recent orders, set L explicitly to 1 to reflect current realized lead time. Demand has changed versus the older 5-sample prior; use recent_N for mu_hat to focus forecast on the latest demand regime (captures last 5 observed demands). Use default sigma_hat to keep volatility estimate based on all available samples scaled by sqrt(1+L). These choices (L=1, recent demand mean) align ordering with the observed quicker arrivals while avoiding relying on the missing/likely-lost early shipments.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22 (Period 11). Recent concluded arrivals (Period4: P3\u2192P4, Period5: P4\u2192P5) show actual lead_time=1 for recent orders; earlier orders from Period1\u2013Period2 remain missing in-transit and likely lost. On-hand=0, in-transit=446 (includes missing/uncertain shipments). Set L using recent lead-time data to reflect current faster arrival behavior while acknowledging lost older shipments. Use recent demand windows (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the latest demand regime (higher variability and recent spikes) rather than the older baseline samples. These choices help the OR backend size orders to cover (1+L) periods of near-term demand with volatility reflected, avoiding overstating mean from stale data and mitigating holding costs given confirmed quicker lead-time for new orders.

Carry-over insight: Recent actual lead_time=1 based on Period4 and Period5 concludes (P3\u2192P4, P4\u2192P5); orders from Period1 and Period2 remain missing and likely lost (no concludes P3\u2013P10; in-transit matches their sum).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29): on-hand=0, in-transit=437 (matches missing orders P1=207+P2=230). Concluded lead times: P4 concl (P3\u2192P4)=1, P5 concl (P4\u2192P5)=1, P11 concl (P9\u2192P11)=2. Evidence shows recent lead time variability (1 and 2). Several early orders (P1,P2) have not concluded for many periods and are likely lost. To hedge uncertainty in arrival timing while avoiding excess holding cost, set L method to 'calculate' so backend uses average of observed lead times; keep demand and volatility priors (mu_hat and sigma_hat) as defaults to base replenishment on full-sample demand given no clear demand regime shift.

Carry-over insight: Recent lead times observed = {1,1,2} (P3\u2192P4, P4\u2192P5, P9\u2192P11) \u2192 lead-time variability emerging; treat actual lead time as >1 and use averaged estimate; Orders from Period1 (207) and Period2 (230) remain missing and likely lost (in-transit=437 equals their sum).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). On-hand=0, in-transit=437 which matches missing orders from Period1 (207) and Period2 (230) and these remain un-concluded \u2192 likely lost/severely delayed. Recent concluded lead times = {1,1,2} (P3\u2192P4, P4\u2192P5, P9\u2192P11) -> emerging variability; use a short recent average to set L. Recent demand has been lower than early spikes; use the last 5 demand samples to form mu_hat and sigma_hat so forecasts reflect the most recent regime. Choices: L: recent_N N=3 to average the three most recent observed lead times (captures 1,1,2); mu_hat: recent_N N=5 to scale (1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 demands and be responsive to recent lower demand; sigma_hat: recent_N N=5 to reflect recent demand variability. These settings raise lead-time cover modestly while keeping forecast anchored to recent demand, balancing service level vs holding cost given suspected lost early shipments.

Carry-over insight: Missing orders from Period1 (207) and Period2 (230) remain un-concluded and likely lost (in-transit=437 equals their sum); recent observed lead times = {1,1,2} indicating increased variability \u2014 treat actual lead time as >1 and use averaged recent estimate.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/10 (Period 18). On-hand=0, in-transit=437 which matches sum of long-missing orders from Period1 (207) and Period2 (230) \u2014 those remain un-concluded and likely lost. Recent concluded arrivals show lead times {1,1,2} (P3\u2192P4, P4\u2192P5, P9\u2192P11) indicating increased variability and a shorter-than-promised central tendency. I set L to recent_N (N=3) to average the three most recent observed lead times, capturing variability while downweighting the lost/never-concluded early orders. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all demand samples, allowing the base-stock calculation to scale with the inferred lead time. This balances service level (by increasing target stock for the slightly longer averaged lead time) against holding cost, while recognizing some in-transit units are likely unrecoverable.

Carry-over insight: Recent lead-time variability confirmed: observed lead times {1,1,2} (P3\u2192P4, P4\u2192P5, P9\u2192P11); treat actual lead time as >1 and use averaged recent estimate; Orders from Period1 (207) and Period2 (230) remain missing and likely lost (in-transit=437 equals their sum).

Observed concluded lead times = {1 (P3\u2192P4), 1 (P4\u2192P5), 2 (P9\u2192P11)} indicating recent lead-time variability; therefore estimate lead time from the most recent 3 observed lead times. Use default demand estimates (all samples) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend uses full historical demand to set base-stock, while L is adjusted to reflect recent lead-time variability and mitigate stockouts from underestimating lead time.

Carry-over insight: Missing orders from Period1 (207) and Period2 (230) remain un-concluded and are likely lost (in-transit=437 equals their sum); recent observed lead times = {1,1,2} indicating increased variability \u2014 use averaged recent estimate.

I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all demand samples; this keeps demand estimate grounded in full sample while the adjusted L inflates the review+lead window to cover variability and compensate for likely lost P1\u2013P2 shipments. This balances service level (higher L -> larger base_stock) against holding cost given low profit/holding ratio.

Carry-over insight: Orders from Period1 (207) and Period2 (230) remain un-concluded and are likely lost (in-transit=437 equals their sum); recent observed lead times = {1,1,2} indicating increased variability \u2014 use averaged recent estimate for L.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29 (Period 25). On-hand=0, in-transit=437 which equals the sum of long-missing Period1 (207) and Period2 (230) orders \u2014 treat those as lost. Recent concluded lead times show variability {1,1,2} (P3\u2192P4, P4\u2192P5, P9\u2192P11). I set L using recent_N (N=3) to average the three most recent observed lead times to capture this variability. Demand history seed = [161,145,179,196,186]; because recent observed sales are censored by stockouts but no clear regime shift in the seed samples, I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to weight the available demand samples across the (1+L) review+lead horizon. For sigma_hat I use recent_N (N=5) to reflect sample volatility while scaling by sqrt(1+L) in the OR engine. These choices make the backend compute a base-stock that explicitly accounts for the slightly elevated/variable lead time while grounding demand forecast in the full recent sample set; that balances service level (avoid stockouts given uncertain L) versus holding cost.

Observed concluded lead times = {1,1,2} (P3\u2192P4, P4\u2192P5, P9\u2192P11) indicating recent variability; therefore use a recent-average lead time (capture shorter recent mode but include variability).

Recent concluded lead times = {1,1,2} (P3\u2192P4, P4\u2192P5, P9\u2192P11) showing variability and an average >1; treat L as the recent average. Demand has trended higher in later periods (recent demands: 146,301,251, etc.), so use recent-demand estimates to capture current regime. Chosen methods: L as recent_N over last 3 observed lead times to reflect emerging variability; mu_hat and sigma_hat as recent_N over last 5 demand samples to focus the forecast on the recent demand regime. This increases buffer vs. promised L while avoiding overstock from outdated data. Missing Period1\u20132 shipments appear lost; we do not rely on them for inventory.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/9 Period31. On-hand=0, in-transit=460 (matches earlier missing P1=207+P2=230=437 plus some later orders). Concluded lead times observed = {1,1,2} (P3\u2192P4, P4\u2192P5, P9\u2192P11) -> increased variability; use averaged recent lead time. To be robust to variability but not overreact to old missing shipments (P1,P2 likely lost), set L via recent_N over last 3 observed lead times. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes demand-per-(review+lead) from full sample history given the chosen L; this balances service level (captures longer recent L) vs holding cost without inflating demand forecast from transient spikes.

Carry-over insight: Orders from Period1 (207) and Period2 (230) remain un-concluded and are likely lost (in-transit=437 equals their sum); recent observed lead times = {1,1,2} indicating increased variability \u2014 use averaged recent estimate for L.

Orders from Period1 (207) and Period2 (230) remain un-concluded and are likely lost. Demand has shifted up recently (last 5 demands: 301,251,231,357,328) \u2014 use recent demand samples. Therefore: set L by averaging the last 3 observed lead times to capture variability; set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent demand regime (last 5 periods) so OR base-stock reflects higher recent demand and volatility while acknowledging missing/lost early shipments.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). On-hand=0, in-transit=620. Historical concludes show recent observed lead times = {1,1,2} (orders: P3\u2192P4, P4\u2192P5, P9\u2192P11) signalling increased lead-time variability vs promised L=2; older orders from P1 (207) and P2 (230) remain missing and likely lost. Demand has shifted up recently (periods 27\u201332: 301,251,231,357,328,341) so forecast should use a recent-sample mean/volatility. To balance service level vs holding cost: use an averaged recent lead-time estimate (captures variability but downweights single anomalies) and compute mu/sigma from the most recent 6 demand observations to reflect the new higher-demand regime while avoiding overreacting to single spikes.

Carry-over insight: Missing orders from Period1 (207) and Period2 (230) remain un-concluded and are likely lost (in-transit previously matched their sum); recent observed lead times = {1,1,2} indicating increased variability \u2014 use averaged recent estimate for L.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Observed concluded lead times show variability: recent observed lead times = {1,1,2,3} (P3\u2192P4, P4\u2192P5, P9\u2192P11, P30\u2192P33) \u2014 average lead time > promised. Several early orders (Period1:207, Period2:230) remain un-concluded and likely lost; in-transit=611 includes other outstanding quantities. I set L via 'calculate' to let backend average observed lead times. For demand and volatility I use default (all-sample) estimates so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the full demand history (scaled by 1+L) and avoid overreacting to recent high variability. This balances service level (by increasing lead-time coverage) against holding cost given modest profit/holding ratio.

Carry-over insight: Recent lead-time variability increased: observed lead times {1,1,2,3} \u2192 treat actual lead time as > promised and use averaged estimate; Orders from Period1 (207) and Period2 (230) remain un-concluded and are likely lost (evidence: no arrivals through Period33 concludes).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/10/07. On-hand=0, in-transit=597; historical concludes show recent observed lead times {1,1,2,3,1} (P3\u2192P4, P4\u2192P5, P9\u2192P11, P30\u2192P33, P33\u2192P34) indicating increased variability and effective lead_time > promised. Orders from Period1 (207) and Period2 (230) remain un-concluded and likely lost. I set L using recent observed lead times to capture variability (average of last 5 observed lead times). Demand has shifted upwards recently (periods 30\u201334 demands = [357,328,341,612,313]), so mu_hat and sigma_hat use the recent 5-sample window to reflect current elevated mean and volatility across the review+lead period. These choices raise target base-stock to protect service level given variable/longer lead times while sigma captures higher demand dispersion to size safety stock against stockouts and limit excess holding given holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Orders from Period1 (207) and Period2 (230) remain un-concluded and are likely lost (in-transit matched their sum previously); recent observed lead times = {1,1,2,3,1} indicating increased variability \u2014 use averaged recent estimate for L.

Demand has stepped up recently (last 5 demands = [328,341,612,313,283], mean\u2248375). Given variable lead time and elevated recent demand, set L using recent lead-time average to capture longer/more variable arrivals; set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent demand regime (last 5 periods) to reflect current elevated mean and volatility and to align the base-stock with (1+L)-period coverage.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21 (Period 37). On-hand=0, in-transit=833; history shows multiple concluded lead times with growing variability (recent observed lead times = {1,1,2,3,1,3}) and persistent missing/likely-lost early shipments (Period1 & Period2). I set L using recent_N to capture the most recent lead-time regime (average of last 6 observed lead times) rather than the promised value. mu_hat and sigma_hat use default methods so the OR backend computes demand across (1+L) periods from full sample history; this balances service level (by increasing lead-time coverage) against holding cost given the profit/holding ratio.

Carry-over insight: Orders from Period1 (207) and Period2 (230) remain un-concluded and are likely lost (in-transit previously matched their sum); recent concluded lead times show increased variability with observed lead times {1,1,2,3,1,3} \u2014 treat actual lead time as > promised and use averaged recent estimate.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28. Recent concluded lead times show variability (observed lead_times = [1,1,2,3,1,3,1]; recent window shows alternating 3 and 1) so treat L as the average of the most recent regime. I choose L: recent_N with N=4 to capture the latest variability while keeping a small recent window. Demand history is sparse/partially censored by stockouts; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting it combine long-run demand estimates with the selected recent lead-time estimate. This balances service level against holding cost under lead-time uncertainty and potential lost shipments.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). On-hand=0, in-transit=697. Historical concluded lead times (by conclude messages) show recent variability: [1,1,2,3,1,3,1]; averaging the most recent 5 observed lead times yields L\u22482 periods which captures recent spread while avoiding overreaction to single spikes. Use L=recent_N (N=5). Demand history is noisy but no clear recent demand regime shift; let backend use default aggregation for mu_hat and sigma_hat so they scale with chosen L. This approach hedges against observed increased lead-time variability and addresses the persistent missing/likely-lost early orders by inflating lead-time estimate rather than inflating demand forecast.

Use a recent-average lead time to capture increased variability and avoid under-ordering. Set L via recent_N (N=6) to average the last 6 observed lead times. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes demand over (1+L) using all samples (conservative given limited sample set). Missing/overdue early orders are likely lost; the chosen L and defaults balance service level vs holding cost under lead-time uncertainty.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). On-hand=0, in-transit=697 which includes long-missing orders from Period1 (207) and Period2 (230) that have never concluded and are likely lost; recent concluded arrivals show variable actual lead times (observed lead_times chronological = {1,1,2,3,1,3,1}). Evidence of increased variability and a rising recent average lead time (~2.0 when averaging the last 5 observations). To hedge against missed/long deliveries, set L based on recent lead-time average (captures variability > promised L=2). Demand forecast and uncertainty use defaults so backend uses full sample statistics scaled by (1+L). This balances higher safety stock for variable/longer lead times while relying on historical demand stats to limit excess holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Orders from Period1 (207) and Period2 (230) remain un-concluded and are likely lost (in-transit historically equals their sum); recent concluded lead times show increased variability with observed lead_times {1,1,2,3,1,3,1} \u2014 use averaged recent estimate for L.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/25 (Period 42). History of conclude messages shows variable actual lead times recently (observed values include 1,2,3 with several 1s and 3s) and multiple very old orders (Periods 1\u20132) remain un-concluded and are likely lost. To reflect the increased lead-time variability I use a recent average for L (captures recent 1\u20133 period behavior) while leaving demand estimates to the backend defaults (no strong, persistent demand regime change signaled beyond historical samples). This balances service-level risk from longer/more variable lead times against holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/2 (Period 43). On-hand=0, in-transit=697 (many prior orders in pipeline). Historical concluded lead times show variability with recent observed lead_times = {1,1,2,3,1,3,1} (avg \u22481.71). Several very old orders (Period1 & Period2) remain un-concluded and likely lost, so do not trust their eventual arrival when sizing orders. Demand shows a large recent spike (Period42 demand=733) and generally elevated recent volumes; with year-end (Dec) likely higher demand, bias forecast toward recent observations. Therefore: set L by averaging the last 7 observed lead times (recent_N N=7) to capture increased variability; set mu_hat using EWMA to emphasize recent high demands (EWMA_gamma=0.4) across the review+lead period; set sigma_hat using recent_N with N=7 to capture recent volatility. These choices help the OR backend raise target base-stock to cover longer/more-variable lead times and elevated recent demand while reflecting increased demand volatility so the capped order prevents extreme over-ordering given holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Orders from Period1 (207) and Period2 (230) remain un-concluded and are likely lost (in-transit previously matched their sum); recent concluded lead times show variability with observed lead_times {1,1,2,3,1,3,1} \u2014 treat actual lead time as > promised and use averaged recent estimate.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09): on-hand=0, in-transit=1194. Historical concluded lead_times = [1,1,2,3,1,3,1] (from P4,P5,P11,P33,P34,P35,P37). Many early orders (P1,P2) remain missing and likely lost; recent concludes show variable but >1 lead time on average. I set L using recent_N over the 7 most recent observed lead times to capture current variability (average \u22481.71). mu_hat and sigma_hat use default formulas so the OR backend will scale demand and variability by (1+L) using that inferred L; this balances higher safety stock for variable/longer lead times while avoiding excessive explicit overordering given holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Recent observed lead times = [1,1,2,3,1,3,1] (concludes P4,P5,P11,P33,P34,P35,P37); use averaged recent lead time (~1.71) going forward; Orders from Period1 and Period2 remain un-concluded and are likely lost (evidence: no arrival through Period43; in-transit historically matched their sum).

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16 (Period 45). Recent concluded lead times = [1,1,2,3,1,3,1] (periods: P4,P5,P11,P33,P34,P35,P37) showing increased variability and a mean \u22481.71. Multiple very old orders (Period1=207, Period2=230) remain un-concluded and effectively lost; in-transit currently large (1194) reflecting later orders. To account for observed lead-time variability use a recent-N average for L (capture recent regime). Use default demand and volatility estimators (backend (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across samples) so the OR engine retains full-sample demand signal while adjusting lead time upward.

Carry-over insight: Recent observed lead times = [1,1,2,3,1,3,1] (concluded P4,P5,P11,P33,P34,P35,P37); average lead time \u22481.71 \u2014 treat actual lead time > promised going forward; Orders from Period1 (207) and Period2 (230) remain un-concluded and are likely lost (no arrivals through Period44; in-transit historically matched their sum).

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/23. On-hand=0, in-transit=1194; historical concludes show variable actual lead times with recent observed lead_times \u2248 [1,1,2,3,1,3,1] (avg \u22481.71). Orders from Period1/2 remain missing and likely lost. To reflect increased lead-time vs promised 2 and the observed variability, set L to averaged recent estimate (explicit). Use default demand aggregation for mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full samples, balancing service level against holding cost given uncertain lead times.

=== Period 46 Summary ===
568601006: ordered=0, arrived=497 units (ordered on Period 43, lead_time was 3 periods), starting on-hand inventory=497, demand=128, sold=128, ending on-hand inventory=369
Daily Profit: $256.00, Daily Holding Cost: $369.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $-113.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30 (Period 47). On-hand=369, in-transit=697; historical concluded lead times show variability with multiple 1,2,3-period arrivals and most early orders (P1,P2) remain missing. Most recent conclude (Period46) shows an arrival with lead_time=3 (ordered P43). Given this variability, infer recent lead time from recent concludes rather than promised L=2. I set L to use recent_N (last 8 observed lead times) to capture emerging variability; mu_hat and sigma_hat use default (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from demand samples) so replenishment scales with the chosen L and observed demand variability. This balances service level (using averaged recent L) against holding cost given profit=2 and holding=1.

Carry-over insight: Updated recent observed lead times now = [1,1,2,3,1,3,1,3] (includes Period46 conclude P43\u2192P46 lead_time=3); average recent lead time \u22481.875 \u2014 treat actual lead time > promised and use averaged recent estimate going forward; Orders from Period1 (207) and Period2 (230) remain un-concluded and are likely lost.
