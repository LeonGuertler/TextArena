Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Product is a womens blazer (pre-spring assortment) with no on-hand or in-transit inventory and no concluded arrivals. Historical demands = [161,145,179,196,186]; no evidence of a recent changepoint. Use promised lead time (0) and default demand estimates: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This keeps the OR engine centered on observed historical demand while avoiding speculative adjustments given no arrivals or calendar shocks.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/2/18. SKU is seasonal apparel (women's blazer) with profit $2 and holding $1. Period-1 conclude shows an order arriving with lead_time=0 (ordered and arrived in Period 1). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, and Period-1 experienced a stockout (demand reported 227, sold 183) indicating potential censored high demand but limited evidence of a sustained regime change. I therefore keep promised lead time (L=0) and use default demand estimators based on all historical samples to be conservative: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This preserves service while avoiding excess holding given slim profit margin.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Product: women's blazer; no season/event spike evident. Historical demands = [161,145,179,196,186] (mean=173.4, std\u224818.23). Concluded arrivals for Periods 1\u20132 show lead_time=0 for orders placed (arrived same period). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must restock to cover current-period demand. Set L to the observed average lead time (0). Use default mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples)=173.4 to target typical period demand. Use default sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples)=18.234 to reflect observed volatility. These parameters align the OR base-stock to historical demand while keeping holding exposure moderate given low profit margin.

Carry-over insight: Observed lead_time confirmed 0 periods (Period 1 and Period 2 concluded arrivals: lead_time=0).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Mariette Blazer (seasonal apparel) currently on-hand=19, in-transit=0. Historical sample set (provided) mean demand=173.4, std\u224818.23. Past conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 0 periods consistently. Use lead time L=0 (average of observed lead times). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat to defaults so the OR engine's base-stock calculation uses the full-sample demand mean and volatility: mu_hat=(1+L)*mean_all=173.4; sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std_all=18.232. This keeps target inventory sized to cover one period of expected demand while relying on the OR backend to trade off service level vs holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-03-11. Recent conclude messages (Periods 1-4) consistently show arrived=(ordered) with lead_time=0 \u2192 actual lead time = 0. On-hand=2, in-transit=0; recent demand history (seed samples) mean=173.4, std\u224818.23. No evidence of lost shipments or regime shift in demand. I set L based on the observed lead times (average of concluded values = 0). I use default demand estimates (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std to let the OR engine compute a base-stock that balances profit ($2) vs holding ($1): this yields moderate service level without excess holding given low holding cost relative to profit.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. Recent concluded periods show same-period arrivals (lead_time=0 confirmed) and a clear upward shift in demand versus older samples: recent demands by period = [227,284,198,214,215], mean=227.6. I set L using the observed lead times (average=0). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the new higher-demand regime; mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_recent = 227.6. Volatility estimated from the same recent window (sample std \u2248 33.17) so sigma_hat = 33.17. These params raise the base-stock to meet the elevated demand while keeping safety stock tuned to observed recent variability; same-period lead time avoids extra pipeline buffer.

Daily Reward (R_t): $403.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent concluded demands (Periods 1-6) average 225.5, well above the older seed samples. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history. On-hand=27, in-transit=0 so pipeline is empty. To capture the new higher-demand regime while keeping holding cost in check, I use L=promised (0) and set demand meta-parameters using the most recent 6 concluded samples (recent_N) so the OR base-stock reflects the higher recent mean and realized volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime has shifted upward: recent mean = 225.5 (Periods 1-6 concluded) vs original sample mean ~173; treat as sustained until new evidence.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. All concluded arrivals (Periods 1\u20137) show lead_time=0 and there are no in-transit units or overdue shipments; demand has shifted up (recent mean 225.5 over Periods 1\u20136). I set L to the observed recent average lead time (0). For demand I use recent_N (N=6, the detected new regime length) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last 6 concluded demands)=225.5. Volatility estimated from the same 6-point regime: sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(last 6) \u2248 30.11. These choices keep the base-stock tuned to the higher sustained demand while reflecting the low lead time, balancing service level (higher mu_hat) against holding cost (sigma-driven safety stock).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08. History shows consistent same-period arrivals (concluded lead_times all 0) and a sustained upward demand regime detected earlier (recent mean 225.5 over Periods 1\u20136). On-hand and in-transit are 0 so we must replenish to cover expected demand this period. I set L using the observed lead times (average=0). I set mu_hat using recent_N (N=6) to capture the sustained higher demand regime: mu_hat=(1+L)*mean_recent=225.5. I set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=6) to reflect volatility in the new regime: population std \u224827.5. These choices raise the base-stock to match the higher demand while keeping safety stock tied to observed recent volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $312.00

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15. Concluded history shows consistent immediate arrivals (lead_time=0) and recent elevated demand vs original small-sample prior. On-hand=44, in-transit=0; next period demand will occur after decision so we must cover (1+L) periods. I set L to promised default (0) because concluded arrivals across periods1-9 confirm same-period lead time. I set mu_hat using the mean of all concluded demands (periods1-9) to capture the sustained higher demand (mean=218.444...), so mu_hat=(1+L)*mean=218.444. I set sigma_hat as the default population std scaled by sqrt(1+L): std \u224830.656. These parameters raise the base-stock to match observed demand regime while keeping volatility realistic, balancing service level (profit/holding => q=2/(2+1)=0.6667 implied by OR) against holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Updated sustained demand mean across concluded periods1-9 = 218.44 (evidence: demands = [227,284,198,214,215,215,186,249,178]; mean=218.444).

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22. On-hand=88, in-transit=0. Concluded history (Periods 1-10) consistently shows arrived=ordered with lead_time=0 \u2014 use promised/default L=0. Recent demand mean across concluded periods 1-10 = 209.6 (sum=2096, n=10); demand volatility (sample std) \u224841.49. Use default aggregation: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_all = 209.6, sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std_all = 41.49. These settings reflect the sustained elevated demand vs original samples while keeping lead-time at 0 so the OR backend computes a base-stock that balances the $2 profit vs $1 holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Updated sustained demand mean across concluded periods 1-10 = 209.6 (evidence: demands = [227,284,198,214,215,215,186,249,178,130]; mean=209.6); confirmed actual lead_time=0 from concluded arrivals in Periods 1-10.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Concluded arrivals through Period 11 confirm actual lead_time=0 (all concluded orders showed lead_time=0). Recent concluded demands (Periods 1\u201311: [227,284,198,214,215,215,186,249,178,130,127]) show a sustained elevated but variable regime with mean=202.09 and sample std\u224844.41. On-hand=88, in-transit=0; next-period demand expectation \u2248202 (1+L)*mean so we must replenish aggressively to avoid stockouts while balancing holding cost. I therefore use L estimated from concluded history (0) and default demand/volatility scaling across the review+lead period so the OR backend's base-stock calculation reflects the updated mean and measured variability.

Carry-over insight: Updated sustained demand mean across concluded periods 1-11 = 202.09 (demands = [227,284,198,214,215,215,186,249,178,130,127]; std\u224844.41); actual lead_time confirmed = 0 across concluded history.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/6 (Period 13). Concluded history (Periods 1\u201312) confirms actual lead_time = 0 across arrivals. On-hand=21, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. I use lead time estimate = average observed (0). Demand forecast: use default (1+L)*mean of all concluded samples to reflect sustained post-change regime while remaining stable\u2014mean demand over concluded 12 periods = 201.1667. Volatility: default sample std across same 12 demands = 42.63. These settings (L=0, mu_hat\u2248201.17, sigma_hat\u224842.63) give the OR engine a base-stock grounded in recent realized demand and low lead time so it balances service level (profit-driven q) versus holding cost given current on-hand.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Concluded history through Period 13 shows all orders arrived same-period (lead_time=0). On-hand=51, in-transit=0. Demand in concluded Periods 1-13 = [227,284,198,214,215,215,186,249,178,130,127,191,160], mean=198.0, sample std\u224844.14. I set L to promised/default (0) since concluded arrivals consistently confirm 0. I use default mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples)=198.0 and default sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples)=44.14 to let the OR backend compute base-stock while balancing profit vs holding cost given stable lead time and current on-hand.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained actual lead_time=0 across concluded history (Periods 1-13); Updated sustained demand mean across concluded Periods 1-13 = 198.0 (evidence: demands listed in rationale).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Context: Period 15 (2019-05-20). Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead_time = 0 across periods 1-14. On-hand=13, in-transit=0. Demand regime: sustained mean across concluded Periods 1-13 = 198.0 (evidence: concluded demands [227,284,198,214,215,215,186,249,178,130,127,191,160], mean=198.0, std\u224844.15). Decision: keep lead-time L = promised (default 0) since concluded history consistently shows L=0. Set mu_hat to explicit forecast = (1+L)*198.0 = 198.0 to reflect sustained elevated demand. Set sigma_hat to explicit = sqrt(1+L)*std \u2248 44.15 to capture observed variability. These parameters steer the OR engine's base-stock toward the observed higher-demand regime while keeping safety stock aligned to realized volatility, balancing service (profit= $2/unit) and holding cost ($1/unit).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/27 (Period 16). On-hand=75, in-transit=0. Concluded history (Periods 1\u201315) shows all arrivals had lead_time=0, so I set L based on the observed average. Demand sample for concluded periods 1\u201315 has mean=194.2 and std\u224843.26; with L=0 the default (1+L) scaling is used. These parameter choices (L=0, mu_hat\u2248194.2, sigma_hat\u224843.26) align the OR base-stock with the updated realized demand level while keeping safety stock proportional to observed volatility, balancing the $2 profit vs $1 holding cost tradeoff.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained actual lead_time=0 across concluded history (Periods 1\u201315). Updated sustained demand mean across concluded Periods 1\u201315 = 194.2 (evidence: demands = [227,284,198,214,215,215,186,249,178,130,127,191,160,196,143]; n=15).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent concluded history (Periods 1\u201315) confirms actual lead_time = 0 and a sustained higher demand regime: mean demand across concluded periods 1\u201315 = 194.2 (n=15, std \u2248 43.25). On-hand = 38, in-transit = 0. I therefore keep lead time = promised (0) and set demand forecast to the sustained observed mean to reflect the regime shift. mu_hat is set explicitly to (1+L)*mean_concluded = 194.2 to target service for the observed demand level. sigma_hat uses the sample volatility across the same concluded history (std \u2248 43.25) scaled by sqrt(1+L) to capture uncertainty. These settings bias the OR backend toward stocking to meet the sustained higher demand while using observed volatility to avoid excessive safety stock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $143.00

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10 (Period 18). On-hand=93, in-transit=0. Concluded history through Period 17 consistently shows actual lead_time=0; no overdue/lost shipments. I set L using observed lead times (average of concluded lead_time=0). Demand estimate uses all concluded demands (Periods 1-17) so mu_hat = mean(demands)=188.176 (1+L multiplier =1). Volatility uses population std of same sample -> sigma_hat=43.43. These choices keep the OR engine aligned with observed zero lead time and recent downwards shift in mean (compared to prior 15-period mean), balancing service (base-stock centered on current mean) vs holding cost by not inflating safety stock beyond observed variability.

Carry-over insight: Updated sustained demand mean across concluded Periods 1-17 = 188.176 (demands = [227,284,198,214,215,215,186,249,178,130,127,191,160,196,143,168,118]); sustained actual lead_time = 0.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Concluded history (Periods 1\u201318) consistently shows arrivals with lead_time=0; treat L as promised (0). Demand has settled to a lower sustained mean across concluded periods 1\u201317: mean=188.176 (evidence: concluded demands list in carry-over). I set mu_hat explicitly to this sustained mean (review+lead period =1\xd7mean since L=0). Volatility estimated from concluded-sample std ~44.41 (periods up to 12 reported std\u224844.41 and consistent with later variability), used as sigma_hat. These params keep base-stock tuned to recent realized demand while avoiding excess holding given holding cost=$1 and profit=$2 (service level target implied by q=2/(2+1)=0.666...).

Carry-over insight: sustained_actual_lead_time=0 (evidence: concluded arrivals Periods 1\u201318 all show lead_time=0); sustained_demand_mean=188.176 (concluded Periods 1\u201317)

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Context: Period 20 (2019-06-24). Concluded history shows consistent same-period arrivals (lead_time=0) across all concluded periods; recent demand regime (Periods 1\u201317) had sustained mean ~188.176. Current inventory: on-hand=86, in-transit=0 \u2014 no overdue shipments. Decision: keep L=0 (use average of observed lead times = 0) because concluded arrivals consistently confirm same-day lead time. For demand I bias to the recent sustained regime (Periods 1\u201317) rather than the last two low weeks, so I set mu_hat using recent_N (N=17) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_recent = 188.176). For volatility I use recent_N (N=17) with sigma_hat = 46.0 to reflect observed variability around that regime. These settings keep the OR base-stock tuned to the sustained higher demand while recognizing low holding cost ($1) relative to profit ($2) \u2014 using the recent regime reduces stockouts vs using only the last two low weeks. On-hand + pipeline (86) should be compared by the OR engine against base-stock; no flagged lost shipments.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-01 (Period 21). History of concluded arrivals shows sustained actual lead_time=0 and recent demand has declined vs earlier regime. On-hand=118, in-transit=0 so we must cover current-period demand after decision. I set L=0 (explicit) because concluded arrivals across periods 1\u201320 confirm same-day arrivals. I use a recent_N demand estimate (N=7, Periods 14\u201320) to capture the clear recent downward shift: demands = [196,143,168,118,139,122,73], mean=137.0; this is more representative for the next (L+1)=1 period than the earlier higher mean. sigma_hat uses the same recent window: sample std \u224839.09 (sqrt uses n-1). These parameters reduce overstock risk given the observed drop while preserving service for the near-term single-period demand.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/8 Period 22. On-hand=38, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show sustained actual lead_time=0 (Periods 1\u201321). Recent changepoint: downward demand regime in Periods 14\u201320 (mean=137.0) vs earlier higher mean; I treat this as current demand level. No overdue shipments observed. Set L to promised/observed 0 to reflect consistent same-period arrivals. Use recent_N for demand estimates with N=7 (Periods 14\u201320) to capture the current low-demand regime: mu_hat = mean(demands 14\u201320)=137.0 (covers review+lead period 1+L). Volatility estimated from same window: population std \u224836.19, so sigma_hat=36.19. These parameters reduce order targets to align pipeline with the recent lower demand, lowering holding cost while preserving service under observed lead_time=0.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-15. Concluded history through Period 22 shows sustained actual lead_time=0 and a recent downward demand regime starting Period 14. Recent demands (Periods 14\u201322): [196,143,168,118,139,122,73,116,120], mean=132.78, std\u224832.89. On-hand=19, in-transit=0 -> exposed to stockouts if forecast too low. I set L based on recent observed lead times (calculate \u2192 0) because every concluded arrival shows lead_time=0. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=9 to capture the downward regime (N=9 is regime length capped by available samples). These parameters bias the OR engine to target inventory for the lower recent demand while preserving safety stock from estimated volatility, balancing profit ($2) vs holding ($1).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Concluded history confirms actual lead_time=0 (all concluded arrivals show W=0). Recent demand has shifted down vs earlier sustained means. I detect a recent regime using the last 10 concluded demands (Periods 14\u201323: [196,143,168,118,139,122,73,116,120,120]) \u2014 N=10 \u2014 with mean=131.5 and sample std\u224833.135. On-hand=28, in-transit=0 -> low available stock. I set L based on the observed lead times (average of concluded W=0). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N to capture the current lower-demand regime so the OR backend will target a lower base-stock and avoid excess holding cost while preserving service.

On-hand=83, in-transit=0 so no pipeline buffer. To avoid excess holding while matching the recent lower demand, set lead time to promised (0) and forecast demand using the recent-regime (last 10 concluded periods, Periods 14\u201323). This keeps base_stock aligned with the lower, current-demand regime and reduces holding cost risk given high on-hand inventory.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Actual lead_time has been consistently 0 in concluded history. Recent data show a sustained downward demand regime since Period 14; I use the most recent regime (Periods 14\u201325, n=12) to forecast. Set L to the promised lead time (0). Set mu_hat using recent_N (N=12) => (1+L)*mean_recent = 122.6667 units to reflect the lower recent demand and avoid overstock. Set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=12) => std_recent \u2248 36.975 to capture observed volatility in the recent regime.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/12 (Period 27). History of concluded periods 1\u201326 confirms actual lead_time=0 and a recent downward demand regime (Periods 14\u201325 mean\u2248122.667, std\u224836.97). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must cover current period demand plus safety. I set L by calculating the average of observed lead times (all concluded arrivals show 0) to match reality. For demand I use recent_N over the detected downward regime (Periods 14\u201325, N=12) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_recent to adapt to the lower demand. For sigma_hat I use recent_N (same N=12) = sqrt(1+L)*std_recent to reflect current volatility. These parameters reduce overstock risk versus using the older higher mean while preserving service via safety stock matching observed variance.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19 (Period 28). Historical concluded arrivals show consistent actual lead_time=0 across all concluded periods; recent demand regime (Periods 14\u201325) is a sustained downward shift (mean=122.6667, std\u224836.97, n=12). Period 27 spike (demand=301) looks like an outlier vs. the recent downward regime and is not yet a sustained changepoint, so I will base forecasts on the recent downward regime to avoid overstock. I set L using the average of observed lead times (calc \u2192 0). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the detected downward regime (Periods 14\u201325, N=12) so the OR backend orders to cover the current lower-demand regime while the capped policy limits order sizes. This balances service (avoid stockouts if demand rebounds modestly) and holding cost (avoid overstock from the period-27 spike).

Carry-over insight: recent_downward_regime_periods_14-25_mean=122.6667; recent_downward_regime_periods_14-25_std\u224836.97; sustained_actual_lead_time=0 (concluded Periods 1\u201327).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26. Concluded history shows actual lead_time=0 consistently. Recent history (Periods 24\u201328 demands = [63,94,146,301,251]) shows a sharp rebound/spike starting Period 26 after a downward regime; this looks like a new short-term regime. I set L to promised (0) because concluded arrivals confirm same-period supply. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the new regime (last 5 concluded demands mean=171.0). Sigma is estimated from the same recent window (sample std \u2248 94.357). These params bias orders toward meeting the recent higher volatility and spikes (improves service vs stockouts) while keeping holding exposure moderate given holding cost=$1/unit and profit=$2/unit.

Carry-over insight: New short-term upward volatility/regime starting Period 26: recent Periods 24-28 demands [63,94,146,301,251] mean=171.0 std\u224894.36; sustained actual lead_time=0 across concluded history.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/2 (Period 30). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Concluded history (Periods 1\u201329) consistently shows actual lead_time=0; recent volatility from Periods 24\u201329 (including a spike to 301) but no evidence of lost shipments. I use promised lead time (default L=0) because concluded arrivals confirm L=0. For demand I use the full-sample default to let the OR engine leverage all history while accounting for the observed volatility; mean of concluded Periods 1\u201329 = 171.5517 units (1+L multiplier applied). Std of concluded Periods 1\u201329 \u2248 60.78 (sqrt(1+L)\xd7sample std). These parameters provide a balanced base-stock: they reflect the long-run mean and measured variability so the backend can compute a service-targeted z (q=profit/(profit+holding)=2/3) while capping order size via its cap rule. No new sustained insight to carry over.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Actual lead_time confirmed 0 in concluded history through Period 30. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we need supply to cover current short-term demand surge. Recent regime: strong upward volatility beginning ~Period 26 (demands in Periods 26\u201330 = [146,301,251,231,357], mean=257.2, std\u224879.01). I therefore set L based on observed lead times (calculate \u2192 0). For demand I use recent_N=5 to capture the current high-demand regime; mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_recent = 257.2. For volatility I use recent_N=5 sample std scaled by sqrt(1+L) \u2192 sigma_hat \u2248 79.01. These parameters bias the OR engine toward higher base-stock to avoid stockouts during the recent spike while acknowledging holding cost through the cap applied by the OR backend.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-16. Concluded history shows sustained actual lead_time=0 through Period 31. Recent demand regime shifted sharply up and is highly volatile starting ~Period 26; last 5 concluded demands (Periods 27-31) = [301,251,231,357,328], mean=293.6, std\u224852.39. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish to cover current high short-term demand. I therefore keep L as promised (0, confirmed by concluded arrivals). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the new short, high-volatility regime so the OR backend raises the base-stock to avoid stockouts during the spike while capping orders via its cap parameter.

Carry-over insight: New short-term high-demand regime starting Period 26: recent 5-period mean=293.6, std\u224852.39 (Periods 27-31: [301,251,231,357,328]); sustained actual lead_time=0 (concluded Periods 1-31).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/23 (Period 33). Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead_time=0. Recent demand shows a clear high-demand regime starting Period 26; last 6 concluded demands (Periods 27\u201332 = [301,251,231,357,328,341]) have mean=301.5 and elevated volatility (std\u224850.72). With on-hand=0 and no pipeline, I set L=0 (confirmed by concluded history) and use a recent-N forecast (N=6) to capture the new high-demand regime so orders cover the immediate surge while avoiding excess hold cost once the spike fades. Parameters: L calculated from observed lead times; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N=6 (last 6 concluded demands) to reflect the current regime and higher variance.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/30 (Period 34). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Concluded history consistently confirms actual lead_time=0. Recent demand shows a sharp upward spike (Periods 29\u201333: 231,357,328,341,612) indicating a short-term high-demand regime. To capture this recent regime and avoid stockouts, set lead time = promised (default 0) and forecast using a recent_N=5 window (most recent 5 concluded demands). mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_recent5 = 373.8 units; sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std_recent5 \u2248 141.70. These parameters raise the base-stock to cover the current high-demand volatility while accepting higher holding cost because stockouts are currently very costly given profit$2 vs holding$1.

Carry-over insight: Short-term high-demand spike: Periods 29-33 demands [231,357,328,341,612] mean=373.8, std\u2248141.7; sustained actual lead_time=0 (concluded history).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Concluded history confirms actual lead_time=0 for all concluded periods. Recent demand shows a short-term high regime: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 30\u201334 = [357,328,341,612,313]) mean\u2248390.2 and high volatility (std\u2248125). To balance service vs holding cost (profit=$2, holding=$1 -> target quantile q=0.6667, moderate safety stock), I set L to promised (0) and base demand estimates using recent_N=5 to capture the current spike while keeping responsiveness to revert. This raises mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine orders enough to meet the near-term high demand spike while the capped cap will limit extreme orders.

Carry-over insight: New short-term high-demand regime detected (Periods 30\u201334 mean\u2248390.2, std\u2248125); sustained actual lead_time=0 across concluded history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $404.00

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-14. Concluded history through Period 35 shows consistent same-period arrivals (lead_time=0). On-hand=162, in-transit=0 so no incoming stock visible. Recent periods (Periods 31-35 demands = [328,341,612,313,283]) show a short-term high-demand regime; I bias forecast to that recent regime to avoid stockouts. Set L based on concluded lead_times=0. Set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) -> (1+L)*mean of last 5 demands = 375.4 units to cover current period demand. Set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) -> sqrt(1+L)*std of last 5 demands \u2248 134.0 to reflect elevated volatility. This raises the base-stock to prioritize service (profit $2 vs holding $1) while accepting holding cost given strong recent demand spike. No overdue shipments detected.

Carry-over insight: sustained_actual_lead_time=0 (evidence: concluded arrivals Periods 1-35 all show lead_time=0); new short-term high-demand regime (Periods 31-35 mean=375.4, std\u2248134) to be used until new concluded evidence.

On-hand=152, in-transit=0. To protect service during this high-volatility spike, set L to promised (0) and forecast based on the most recent 5 concluded demands (captures the spike). This raises mu_hat to cover one-period demand at the recent elevated mean while sigma_hat reflects the high recent volatility; parameters bias ordering toward higher service level while accepting higher holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). On-hand=37, in-transit=0 and recent concluded history shows a short-term high-demand regime (Periods 34\u201338). Concluded arrivals confirm sustained actual lead_time=0. To avoid stockouts given low on-hand and high recent demand, set L to promised/confirmed 0. Forecast demand across the review+lead period using recent 5 concluded demands (Periods 34\u201338) to capture the current high-demand regime: mean=315.2. Estimate volatility from the same 5-period window: std\u224841.90.

On-hand=103, in-transit=0 so we must replenish for imminent demand. I set L=default (promised 0) because concluded arrivals consistently show 0. For demand I use recent_N (N=5, Periods 35\u201339) to capture the current high-demand regime: mean(283,282,313,385,231)=298.8 \u2192 mu_hat=(1+L)*mean=298.8. Volatility estimated from the same 5-period window (sample std \u224856.49) \u2192 sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std=56.49. These choices raise the base-stock to match the short-term elevated demand while keeping sigma based on recent variability to avoid excessive safety stock given holding cost.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/18. Concluded history shows sustained actual lead_time=0 through Period 40. Recent demand has entered a high regime: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 36\u201340) = [282,313,385,231,278], mean \u2248297.8, std \u224856.9. On-hand=46, in-transit=0 so we need to replenish for same-period demand (L=0). I set L using recent evidence (lead_time=0). I set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the current high-demand regime (mu_hat=(1+L)*recent_mean \u2248297.8). I set sigma_hat using recent_N=5 (sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*recent_std \u224856.9) so the OR backend raises the base-stock and safety stock to avoid stockouts while balancing holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). Concluded history shows sustained actual lead_time=0 through Period 41. Recent periods (37-41 demands = [313,385,231,278,245]) exhibit a short-term high-demand regime; I use this recent 5-period regime to forecast demand and volatility. Set L=0 (confirmed by concluded arrivals). mu_hat uses recent_N=5 to capture current elevated demand; sigma_hat uses recent_N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters raise the base-stock to improve service during the high-demand spell while keeping holding cost considerations via the OR engine's z* calculation.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/02 (Period 43). Concluded history (Periods 1\u201342) consistently shows arrivals with lead_time=0; on-hand=0, in-transit=0 and a large recent stockout driven by Period 42 demand=733. I set L to promised/default (0) because concluded arrivals confirm same-period fulfillment. Demand exhibits a sharp recent spike so I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the new short-term regime (Periods 38\u201342 demands = [385,231,278,245,733], mean=374.4, std\u2248208.85). mu_hat = (1+L)*recent_mean = 374.4 to target service for the current high-demand surge; sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*recent_std = 208.85 to reflect high volatility and keep safety stock elevated. These parameters bias the OR engine toward higher base-stock to avoid costly stockouts (profit > holding cost) while recognizing elevated uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: sustained_actual_lead_time=0 (concluded Periods 1\u201342); recent short-term demand spike: Period 42 demand=733, recent 5-period mean=374.4 std\u2248208.85 (Periods 38\u201342).

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09 (Period 44). Concluded history shows sustained actual lead_time=0 through Period 43. Recent demand spike/seasonality: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 39-43) = [231,278,245,733,169], 5-period mean=331.2, std\u2248228.1. On-hand = 296, in-transit = 0. To balance service vs holding cost given high recent volatility and current large on-hand, use a 5-period recent demand estimate to capture holiday spike while avoiding excessive fresh orders. Set L to promised (0) consistent with concluded arrivals. mu_hat uses recent_5 mean (1+L)*mean to target short-term demand; sigma_hat uses recent_5 std to reflect high uncertainty and let OR cap orders via its cap rule.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/16 (pre-Christmas): concluded history shows persistent actual lead_time=0 (all concluded arrivals Periods 1\u201344). Recent demand has spiked (holiday season): last 5 concluded demands (Periods 40\u201344) = [278,245,733,169,304], mean=345.8, std\u2248198.84. On-hand=126, in-transit=0; with L=0 we must cover current-period demand (no pipeline). I set L based on observed lead-times (average=0). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N=5 to capture the current high-demand holiday regime and increased volatility so the OR backend raises the base-stock and cap to avoid stockouts during the spike while accepting higher holding cost short-term.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (pre-Christmas). Concluded history shows sustained actual lead_time=0. Recent demand spike (holiday) \u2014 last 5 concluded demands (Periods 41\u201345) = [245, 733, 169, 304, 258], 5-period mean=341.8, std\u2248224. I set L=0 (use promised/observed lead_time=0). Forecast mu_hat uses recent_N (N=5) to capture the holiday spike: mu_hat=(1+L)*recent_mean=341.8. Volatility uses recent_N (N=5) sample std => sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*recent_std\u2248224. These parameters raise the base-stock to preserve service during the holiday surge while the high sigma inflates safety stock to avoid stockouts; with L=0 no pipeline inflation needed. On-hand=184 and in-transit=0 \u2014 ordering will top up against this high short-term demand.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30 (Period 47). History of concluded arrivals shows sustained actual lead_time=0. Recent demand shows a short-term holiday spike: concluded demands Periods 42\u201346 = [733,169,304,258,128], recent 5-period mean=318.4, std\u2248241.6. On-hand=311, in-transit=0 \u2014 current stock already covers ~1 period at recent mean, but holiday volatility is high. To protect service during the holiday spike while limiting extra holding cost, set lead time L to promised (0) and forecast using the recent 5-period regime for both mean and volatility. This raises base_stock and safety stock to reflect the current spike and high variance, reducing expected stockouts during holiday demand surges while accepting moderate holding cost given high profit/holding ratio (q\u22480.667).
