Because we only see concluded messages up through Period 4, we cannot yet prove shipments are lost or late beyond the promised lead time\u2014Period 5 arrivals will be revealed only in the Period 5 conclude message available in Period 6. Inventory & demand analysis: Historical single-period mean demand = 266.4 (samples [231,255,302,272,272]). OR's base-stock logic (using L=4) implies a 5-period expected demand \u03bc\u0302 \u2248 1332 and a base_stock \u2248 1357; current pipeline (in-transit + on-hand) = 1357, so pipeline \u2248 base_stock.

Given we lack concluded evidence of lost shipments (must wait for Period 5 conclude) and holding cost equals half the profit per period, I avoid adding inventory until arrivals are confirmed. Decision relative to OR: OR recommended 351 units; that recommendation assumes promised lead time and does not account for current full pipeline or possible lost shipments. Because pipeline \u2248 base_stock and we have zero on-hand, I order 0 now to avoid unnecessary holding costs and to wait for Period 5 conclude to verify arrivals before reacting further.
