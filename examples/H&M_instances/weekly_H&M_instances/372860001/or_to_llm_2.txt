{
  "rationale": "Lead-time: confirmed as 0 (carry-over). Inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must order to meet this period's demand. Demand outlook: recent concluded demands (Periods 43\u201346) = [143,209,231,224], recent mean \u2248202 with variability; older regime-shift insight (+35% earlier in year) is historical and not sustained in latest weeks. OR baseline (359) reflects a higher historical/shifted mean; ordering that much now would create unnecessary holding cost given recent lower demand. With profit=$4 and holding=$1 (critical fractile q=0.8 \u2192 moderate safety), I target the near-term expected demand plus modest safety: 202 \xd7 1.15 \u2248 232 units. This balances service (avoid stockouts this period with lead_time=0) and holding cost given on-hand=0.",
