Current inventory position: on-hand=440, in-transit=282 -> total pipeline=722. Demand signal: recent realized demands are elevated vs long-run historical samples (recent periods: 287,548,399,338,252,329,415,382; recent average \u2248376/week) while long-run sample mean=266.4, \u03c3\u224826. Given promised L=2, the (L+1)-period coverage target is 3\xd7recent_mean\u22481,128 units. OR recommends 332 (base-stock capped policy using promised L and historical demand). Adjustment reasoning: I reduce OR's recommendation because (a) we already hold a large on-hand balance (440) and substantial in-transit (282) which together provide strong near-term coverage and help smooth lead-time variability; (b) there is evidence of lost shipments and variable lead times, so aggressively topping up to OR's level risks higher holding costs ($1/unit/period) if demand softens; (c) profit per unit is only $2 so critical fractile is moderate (q=2/3), favoring some safety stock but not aggressive over-ordering. Action decision: place a conservative partial refill (200 units) to maintain buffer without incurring excessive holding cost. This keeps total committed inventory \u2248922, which covers ~2.5\u20133 weeks at recent demand rates while limiting downside from lost/late shipments.
