Given no in-transit buffer and a plausible need to serve \u2248800 units before replenishment arrives (orders will only arrive after the lead time), I order to cover the 3-period expected demand.

Decision logic: With 1093 units already in transit > 696 required for next 3 periods, we have sufficient pipeline to cover demand even allowing for lead-time variability. Ordering would only increase holding cost ($1/unit/period) without raising profit, and risk excess stock if shipments arrive early. Final action: place 0 order. ",
