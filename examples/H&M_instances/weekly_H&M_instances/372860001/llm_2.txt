============================================================
{
  "rationale": "World/calendar: Post-Christmas (2019-12-30) \u2014 demand likely moderating from holiday spike. Product: womens socks (some seasonality around gifts) but current short-term demand (P42\u2013P46) averages ~252 units. Demand forecast: ~230\u2013260 next period; historical recent regime ~230\u2013300 with variability. Inventory/pipeline: On-hand=76; large in-transit=1266 but supplier lead time has been historically variable (1\u20133+ periods) and some shipments long-overdue\u2014treat pipeline as uncertain. Economics: Profit $2/unit vs holding $1/unit/period \u2014 high carrying cost penalizes excess stock. Lead time: promised 2 but actual unstable; orders placed now will not arrive before at least 2 periods, so cannot solve immediate stockout. Decision logic: avoid adding to an already large, uncertain pipeline to minimize holding cost risk. With limited on-hand (76) we will incur some lost sales this period, but placing new orders risks excess inventory when delayed shipments eventually arrive. Therefore place no new order.",
