Holding cost ($1/unit/period) is high relative to profit ($2/unit), so overstock is costly. However, no inventory means lost sales and foregone profit.\ne) Final order logic: place a modest test shipment to probe supplier lead time and capture some demand while limiting holding-cost risk. Given stable demand ~266 but high holding cost and zero visibility on lead time, order conservatively (50 units) to get product into channel and observe arrival behavior before committing to large replenishments.",
