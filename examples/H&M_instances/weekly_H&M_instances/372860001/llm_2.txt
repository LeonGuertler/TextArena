Date 2019-02-11 is just before Valentine's Day (2019-02-14); socks are not a major seasonal gift but demand may be slightly elevated \u2014 treat as minor upward bias. b) Demand regime: historical unified samples = [231,255,302,272,272]. Sample mean \u2248 266 units/period; moderate variability but no clear trend. Use mean as baseline. c) Lead time & missing orders: promised lead time = 4 periods. No concluded arrivals yet, so cannot infer actual lead time or losses. d) Inventory & pipeline: on-hand = 0, in-transit = 0. With L=4 the decision must cover current period demand plus 4 future periods (L+1 = 5 periods) because arrivals occur after demand. e) Final order logic: target supply = baseline demand \xd7 (L+1) = 266 \xd7 5 = 1330 units to cover expected demand over the next 5 periods. This balances service (avoid stockouts given long lead time) against holding cost; small Valentine\u2019s uplift already modest relative to demand variance. Order placed now will arrive in Period 1+4 and be visible in conclude for Period 1+4. Monitor arrivals to update lead-time inference and adjust future orders.",
