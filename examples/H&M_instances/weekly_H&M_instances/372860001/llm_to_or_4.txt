Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11 (no special calendar events). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 and no concluded arrivals yet; promised lead time is 4 periods. Historical demands: [231,255,302,272,272] show stable mean ~266. Use default methods so backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std with the promised L=4. This balances service (covering L+1 periods) against holding cost given moderate demand and no evidence of lead-time shifts or demand regime change.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Product: women's fine-knit trainer socks. Historical demands: [231,255,302,272,272] (mean=266.4). On-hand=0, in-transit=310 (order placed in Period 1; arrived=0 in Period 1 conclude \u2014 consistent with promised lead time=4, not evidence of loss). No concluded arrivals yet to infer actual lead time. Use promised lead time to let OR backend apply its lead-time model. Choose default demand estimates (use full-sample mean and std scaled by (1+L)) so the backend computes base stock with stable historical demand; this balances service level given modest profit/holding ratio and avoids overreacting to a single non-concluded arrival.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
On-hand=0, in-transit=621 (orders from P1\u2013P2 not yet concluded). No concluded arrivals with lead-time info, so cannot infer actual lead time\u2014use promised lead time. Demand history (all samples mean=266.4) shows no confirmed regime shift; use default methods so OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This keeps policy aligned with promised L while covering expected demand over the review+lead horizon and letting the OR engine cap orders to control holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Outstanding undelivered orders total 621 units (ordered P1\u2013P2); no concluded arrivals observed\u2014monitor for lost shipments.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Context: Period 4 (2019-03-04). On-hand=0, in-transit=1108, history shows no concluded arrivals for orders placed in P1\u2013P3 (outstanding ~621 units noted). Recent realized demand (decision-facing samples) increased and is volatile (P1\u2013P3 demands: 287, 548, 399) vs older baseline. Risk: some shipments may be delayed/lost; be conservative on lead time and use recent demand to capture current regime. Choices: set L explicit=6 to guard against prolonged/shifted lead times given repeated non-arrivals; use recent_N N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the elevated, variable recent demand pattern. This increases coverage for (1+L) periods under current demand and raises safety stock through the OR backend's base-stock computation, balancing lost-sales risk vs holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
No on-hand stock and large pipeline (in-transit=1735) with zero concluded arrivals through Period 4: all orders from P1\u2013P4 remain undelivered, suggesting promised lead time=4 is not being met and shipments are delayed or lost. To avoid under-ordering while arrivals are uncertain, I explicitly increase lead-time estimate to 5 periods. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all historical demand samples [231,255,302,272,272], which raises the base-stock to cover the longer effective coverage period while the pipeline is unresolved.

Carry-over insight: All orders placed in Periods 1\u20134 (total 1735 units) have no concluded arrivals through Period 4; shipments appear delayed or lost\u2014monitor for missing arrivals and treat lead-time as extended until conclusions arrive.

Daily Reward (R_t): $446.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18): demand history shows recent samples [231,255,302,272,272] (mean=266.4). A concluded arrival in Period 5 (310 units ordered in P1, lead_time=4) confirms that actual lead time =4 periods for at least that shipment. On-hand=58, in-transit=1730 (many prior orders remain unconfirmed) \u2014 treat pipeline as present but monitor for lost shipments. Choices: set L to "calculate" so backend uses observed lead times (uses evidence W=4); use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing a conservative baseline that weights recent demand and the confirmed lead time. This balances service (higher base stock via (1+L)*mean) against holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods based on Period 5 conclude: arrived=310 units (ordered on Period 1, lead_time was 4 periods). Continue monitoring outstanding in-transit (1730 units) for possible lost shipments.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25): on-hand=40, in-transit=1419. Two concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 4 (orders from P1 and P2 arrived in 4 periods); many in-transit units remain from P3\u2013P4 and may yet conclude or be lost. Given confirmed LT=4 and no strong recent demand regime shift, use the promised/default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR engine leverages all historical samples. This keeps the backend's base-stock grounded in full-sample mean/variance while capping order size to limit excess holding (profit $2 vs holding $1 favors moderate service level).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). SKU 372860001 (trainer socks): recent concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 periods. Historical demands [231,255,302,272,272] show stable weekly demand; on-hand=112, in-transit=1144 (large outstanding pipeline). Given confirmed L=4 and stable demand, use default lead-time and default demand/volatility aggregation so OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from full sample. This keeps policy aligned with observed lead time while letting the OR cap control order quantities against the large outstanding pipeline to avoid excess holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods based on concluded arrivals (P5\u2013P7). Large outstanding in-transit pipeline remains (~1144 units) \u2014 monitor for lost shipments if arrivals fail to conclude.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 start: on-hand=357, in-transit=974. Historical concludes (P5\u2013P8) consistently show arrivals for orders placed in P1\u2013P4 with lead_time=4 \u2014 actual lead time confirmed at 4. Past missing-conclude concern resolved into a consistent L=4 regime. Demand history samples [231,255,302,272,272] show stable mean (~266.4) and moderate variance. I choose to set L by calculating observed lead times (captures confirmed LT=4), and use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend applies (1+L) scaling to the full-sample mean and std \u2014 this balances service level (cover 1+L periods) against holding cost given confirmed 4-period lead time and sizeable pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (evidence: Period 5\u20138 conclude: arrivals for orders placed in P1\u2013P4 had lead_time=4). Outstanding in-transit remains large (974 units as of Period 9) \u2014 monitor for any lost shipments if future concludes do not match.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15 (Period 10). Recent concludes (P5\u2013P9) consistently show arrivals for orders placed in P1\u2013P5 with lead_time=4 \u2014 actual lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. Current inventory: on-hand=340, in-transit=1070. Several earlier delayed shipments have now concluded, but a large pipeline (1070) remains and will cover upcoming demand; holding cost = $1/unit/period vs profit $2/unit implies moderate service-level target. Use promised/default lead time and default demand stats to let the OR backend compute a base-stock that balances profit vs holding cost given confirmed L=4 and no clear demand regime shift in the small sample seed.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (evidence: Period 5\u20139 conclude: arrivals for orders placed in P1\u2013P5 had lead_time=4); large remaining in-transit pipeline ~1070 units as of Period 10 \u2014 monitor for future lost shipments.

Large outstanding pipeline suggests delayed/lost shipments risk; keep lead-time estimate aligned with observed actuals so OR orders account for full delay. Use L=4 (explicit) to reflect confirmed lead time; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from demand history, balancing service level against holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

Period 12 (2019-04-29): on-hand=0, in-transit=1473. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 periods. Significant pipeline exists and some shipments previously delayed but recent concludes support L=4. I therefore keep L at default (promised), and use default demand/volatility aggregation so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the historical samples. This balances service level (use confirmed LT) while avoiding manual over-adjustment given large in-transit stock and holding cost.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). Recent conclude messages (Periods 5\u201312) consistently show arrivals for orders placed 4 periods earlier \u2192 actual lead time confirmed at 4 periods. Large pipeline remains (In-transit=1292) but arrivals have been concluding on a 4-period cadence recently. Demand has increased vs. the older 5-sample prior; last 5 concluded period demands = [382,322,308,427,438], mean \u2248 375.4, indicating a higher recent regime. I set L by calculation (average observed lead times = 4). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the higher recent mean and volatility ((1+L)\xd7recent mean to size cover for review+lead periods and recent std scaled by sqrt(1+L)). This balances service level (captures elevated recent demand) while letting the capped order cap limit excessive single-period ordering given large in-transit inventory.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained actual lead time = 4 periods based on Periods 5\u201312 concluded arrivals; large outstanding in-transit (~1292) remains\u2014monitor for lost shipments if future concludes deviate.

Given confirmed L=4 and stable historical demand samples, use default estimators so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample set. This keeps policy aligned with observed lead time while letting OR engine balance service level vs holding cost automatically; avoids overfitting to recent noisy concludes and preserves coverage for the 5-period demand window (current + 4-period lead).

Concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods; pipeline is large but arrivals are concluding on the 4-period cadence.

Current inventory: on-hand=145, in-transit=1250 \u2014 large pipeline but arrivals have been concluding with 4-period lead time, so treat promised L=4 as valid. Use default L so backend uses promised lead time; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample set, balancing service level (profit $2 vs holding $1) with holding cost given large pipeline.

On-hand=51, in-transit=1323 \u2192 large pipeline outstanding; no new evidence of lost shipments but arrivals have been matching 4-period lag.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10 (Period 18). On-hand=227, in-transit=1228. Historical concluded arrivals from Periods 5\u201317 consistently show actual lead_time=4 (orders placed P1\u2013P13 concluded with W=4). Demand seed samples mean=266.4 (samples [231,255,302,272,272]). Given consistent evidence of L=4 and no recent regime change in demand, use promised/default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples. This keeps the base-stock anchored to observed demand while the backend's capped order rule limits excessive single-period receipts\u2014appropriate given the large in-transit pipeline to avoid overstocking if delayed shipments reappear.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained actual lead_time = 4 based on concluded arrivals P5\u2013P17; large outstanding in-transit pipeline = 1228 units as of Period 18\u2014monitor for lost shipments.

On-hand=221, in-transit=1183 \u2014 large pipeline but arrivals have been regular with LT=4. Use promised/default lead time to match observed sustained LT=4 and keep OR engine assumptions aligned. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from historical samples) because recent demand shows no clear regime shift beyond normal variability; defaults keep policy stable against the large pipeline and balance fill vs holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:

Date 2019-07-15 (Period 23). Recent concluded history (Periods 5\u201322) consistently shows arrivals with lead_time=4 \u2014 actual lead time sustained at 4. Demand history across concluded periods is stable around ~300 units/period. Current inventory: on-hand=194, in-transit=1210 (large pipeline that may include delayed/lost shipments). Given stable demand and confirmed lead time, use defaults so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples; this balances service-level needs against holding cost while the pipeline is monitored for missing arrivals.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22). On-hand=127, in-transit=1234. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead_time = 4 periods (evidence: concludes P5\u2013P23). Large pipeline exists but arrivals have matched a 4-period lead time repeatedly, so use the promised/default lead time. Demand history shows no strong recent structural shift; use default aggregate demand and volatility estimates so the OR engine applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. These choices let the backend compute a base-stock that balances the $2 profit vs $1 holding cost using observed demand & confirmed L=4 while avoiding overreacting to pipeline noise or temporary deviations.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29 (Period 25). Historical concludes (P5\u2013P24) consistently show arrivals for orders placed four periods earlier => actual lead time = 4. On-hand=183, in-transit=1256 (large pipeline). Use promised/default lead time so OR backend uses L=4. Demand seed (small sample set) and stable historical pattern => use default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of samples). This keeps service level high to deplete large pipeline while avoiding aggressive extra stocking; defaults let OR compute base stock using observed demand stats and the known profit/holding tradeoff.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained actual lead_time = 4 periods based on concluded arrivals through Period 24; large outstanding in-transit pipeline = 1256 units as of Period 25 \u2014 monitor for lost shipments.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). On-hand=206, in-transit=1244. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (confirmed repeatedly P5\u2013P25). Outstanding pipeline is large but arrivals have matched a 4-period lag when concluded. Demand history shows stable weekly demand; no new calendar events requiring a demand regime shift. To keep the OR backend aligned with observed reality and avoid introducing biased short-term adjustments, use promised/default lead time and default demand estimates (use full-sample mean/variance across history). This balances service (profit $2 vs holding $1) by letting the backend compute a base-stock that accounts for multi-period demand (1+L) without overreacting to pipeline noise.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). Historical conclude messages P5\u2013P26 consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods; large in-transit pipeline persists (1175 units) while on-hand = 261. Recent demand history is stable with no clear regime shift. Given confirmed sustained lead time=4 and no demand changepoint, use default lead-time and default demand estimates so OR backend can apply its base-stock calculation while accounting for promised L=4.

Carry-over insight: Sustained actual lead time = 4 periods (evidence: concluded arrivals P5\u2013P26); large outstanding in-transit pipeline = 1175 units as of Period 27.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-08-26 (Period 29). Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods. On-hand=330, in-transit=1055 -> total pipeline=1385. Using the provided 5-sample demand history (mean \u2248266.4), (1+L)*mean \u22481332, so pipeline slightly exceeds the target cover for the review+lead period. I therefore keep lead time at the promised/default (observations confirm L=4) and use default demand aggregation and volatility so the OR backend computes base stock from the full-sample mean/STD, keeping service while avoiding excess holding.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). SKU 372860001 (socks): profit $2, holding $1. Observed on-hand=368, in-transit=1077. Concluded arrivals through Period 29 consistently show actual lead_time = 4 periods (orders placed P1\u2013P25 concluded with W=4), so I accept the promised lead time. Historical demand samples (provided seed) are limited but show stable demand; no strong changepoint detected. To keep the OR backend aligned with observed stable lead time and use all available demand history, I select default methods: L=default so backend uses promised lead time=4; mu_hat=default to compute (1+L)*mean(all samples) and capture demand over review+lead; sigma_hat=default to compute sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This conservative choice leverages the backend's base-stock calculation to cover (L+1) periods of demand while avoiding manual over-adjustment despite a large in-transit pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained actual lead_time = 4 periods (evidence: concluded arrivals through Period 29); large in-transit pipeline = 1077 units as of Period 30 \u2014 monitor for possible lost shipments if future concludes deviate.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/10/14 (Period 36). History shows a stable observed lead time = 4 periods (many concluded arrivals with lead_time=4) and substantial pipeline (in-transit=1212) with on-hand=169. Demand history is stable with no recent structural changepoint. Given confirmed L=4 and no fresh news, use default lead time and default demand/volatility estimates so the OR engine applies its full-sample mean/std. This avoids overreacting to pipeline noise while the in-transit volume resolves; defaults balance service level (covering L+1 periods) against holding cost.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/10/21 (Period 37). Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead_time = 4 periods (orders placed P1\u2013P36 concluded with 4). On-hand=174, in-transit=1226 => total pipeline=1400, which covers multiple periods of expected demand. Historical demand samples (seed) show stable mean (~266.4). No recent changepoint in demand or lead time detected. Therefore use default lead time and default demand/volatility aggregation so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std, keeping service level aligned with steady observed 4-period lead time while avoiding unnecessary extra safety stock given large existing pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Sustained actual lead_time = 4 periods (confirmed through concluded arrivals up to Period 36); large outstanding in-transit pipeline = 1226 units as of Period 37.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). Product is seasonal-basic socks; recent concluded history consistently shows actual lead time = 4 periods (concluded arrivals P5\u2013P37). Current inventory: on-hand=107, in-transit=1218 \u2014 large pipeline remains. Given stable confirmed lead-time and no evidence of a regime change in demand, use promised/default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend leverages full sample history and the confirmed L=4. This balances service (keep pipeline coverage for L+1 periods) against holding cost by letting the engine compute base_stock from all observed demand stats.

Carry-over insight: Sustained actual lead_time = 4 periods confirmed through Period 37; large outstanding in-transit pipeline = 1218 units as of Period 38.

Current inventory: on-hand=318, in-transit=1066 (large pipeline). No recent changepoint in demand; use baseline demand stats.

Lead time has been consistently observed = 4 periods in concluded messages across many periods; pipeline large (on-hand=425, in-transit=1037) but arrivals have been regular with LT=4. Demand history shows stable weekly demand pattern. To avoid over-adjusting to pipeline noise and because LT is confirmed, use the backend defaults so it computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from observed demand. This balances service level (use confirmed LT=4) while avoiding extra inventory risk given already-large in-transit stock.

Current on-hand=449 and in-transit=933 => total supply=1382 units, which slightly exceeds (1+L)*mean(historical sample mean=266.4 \u2192 1332) so pipeline coverage is adequate. No strong recent demand regime change or seasonality signal requiring manual override.

Recent demand history shows stable weekly demand around mid-200s\u2013300s. Given confirmed L=4 and no strong recent demand regime shift or calendar spike, use defaults so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std from full sample set; this leverages long-run demand stats and the proven 4-period lead time while letting the backend cap orders appropriately to balance service level vs holding cost.

Observed concluded arrivals consistently imply actual lead time = 4 periods; current inventory: on-hand=439, in-transit=912 (pipeline healthy). I use default lead time (promised 4) and default demand/volatility so the OR backend leverages full historical samples to compute base-stock and cap; this keeps service levels high while letting the backend trade off profit vs. holding cost given profit=$2 / holding=$1.
