Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11; no special calendar events affecting basic women's trainer socks. Historical demand samples: [231,255,302,272,272] show stable demand (mean 266.4, std ~23.29). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we need coverage for (L+1)=1 period. No evidence of lead-time deviations or lost shipments in concluded history. Use default/past-demand statistics to let OR backend compute base-stock targeting profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 conclude shows ordered=278 arrived=278 (ordered on Period 1, lead_time was 0 periods) \u2014 actual lead time confirmed = 0. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so no coverage for upcoming demand. Use default estimators: include all observed demands (historic [231,255,302,272,272] plus Period 1 demand 287 => mean=269.83, std\u224824.76). With L=0, set mu_hat = (1+L)*mean = 269.83 to cover current period demand; sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std = 24.76 to represent demand variability. These settings match OR backend defaults and balance service level (use mean demand) against holding cost by not inflating lead-time or safety stock given confirmed 0 lead time.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time confirmed 0 periods (evidence: Period 1 conclude: ordered on Period 1 arrived=278, lead_time was 0 periods).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/02/25. Recent concluded periods confirm actual lead time = 0 (Period 1 and 2 arrivals same-period). Demand has jumped recently (Period2 demand=548 vs prior samples), so I incorporate all available samples (including the two most recent periods) to keep responsiveness while retaining historical weight. I use promised/default lead time (0). mu_hat and sigma_hat set to default formulas over all samples (7 observations: 231,255,302,272,272,287,548) so the OR engine targets a base-stock that balances profit ($2) vs holding ($1). This keeps ordering aggressive enough to cover the recent spike while the confirmed L=0 allows same-period replenishment.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Historical demands steady (samples [231,255,302,272,272], mean=266.4, std\u224826.04). Recent concluded periods confirm actual lead time = 0 (Period 1-3 concludes: arrivals same period). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must cover current period demand. I set L via recent concluded lead-times (calculate \u2192 0). mu_hat uses default (1+L)*mean of all samples to provide a stable forecast (266.4 units) and sigma_hat uses default population volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L) (\u224826.04) so the OR backend's base-stock balances profit vs. holding cost using historical demand uncertainty while avoiding excess inventory given zero lead time.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. Historical concludes show orders placed in Periods 1-4 all arrived same period (lead_time=0); on-hand=28, in-transit=0. I set L by averaging observed lead times (all 0 \u2192 L=0). Demand samples [231,255,302,272,272] mean=266.4 and sample population std\u224823.295. With L=0 I use default rules: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean = 266.4 and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std = 23.295. These settings reflect recent high demand levels while keeping variability modest; with profit $2 and holding $1 the backend will target a service-biased base-stock but capped to limit excess inventory given current on-hand=28.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. Product: basic trainer socks; recent demand samples [231,255,302,272,272] show stable mean (~266) and moderate variability (std \u224823). All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 (Periods 1\u20135 concludes), so actual lead time regime is 0; no evidence of lost shipments. On-hand=113, in-transit=0 => current coverage ~0.42 of a period, so we should replenish to cover (L+1) demand. I use: L estimated from observed lead times (calculate), and mu_hat/sigma_hat using all historical samples (default) because no changepoint or seasonality is detected. These parameters give the OR engine a forecast centered on the empirical mean while keeping extra safety stock moderate (profit $2 vs holding $1 implies moderate service level).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25. Recent concludes show consistent same-period arrivals (all observed lead_times=0) and demand in the last 6 periods has risen and become more volatile (demands: 287,548,399,338,252,329). I set L based on observed lead times (calculate) = 0. For forecasting I use recent_N=6 to capture the upward-shift and volatility in demand; mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last 6 demands) to size the base-stock for expected near-term demand, and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(last 6 demands) to reflect increased uncertainty and drive safety stock. These parameters bias orders toward higher coverage to avoid stockouts given recent spikes while the higher sigma tempers excessive overstock by increasing the OR z* calculation cost-sensitively.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (Periods 1\u20137). Recent demand has been elevated and variable (period demands: [287,548,399,338,252,329,415]); no lost shipments. I set L by averaging observed lead times (0). For demand I use recent_N (N=7, the most recent regime) to capture the current higher mean. mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last7) => 366.857. sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(last7) => 91.0. These parameters raise the base-stock to cover the current higher demand while reflecting observed variability, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08. Recent concluded history (Periods 4-8) shows a higher, more variable demand regime vs the initial five-sample prior. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 periods (confirmed earlier). I therefore set L=0 (use promised lead time). For demand I use a recent_N estimate (N=5, Periods 4-8 demands = 338,252,329,415,382) to capture the current regime: mean = 343.2 units for the (1+L) review+lead period and sample std = 61.66. This raises the base-stock target to match elevated recent demand and retains safety stock for observed volatility, reducing stockouts while keeping holding exposure limited because L=0.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15. Recent conclude history (Periods 1-9) consistently shows same-period arrivals; actual lead time confirmed 0. On-hand=48, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Demand history samples = [231,255,302,272,272] (mean=266.4, std\u224826.04). I set L by averaging observed lead times (confirm 0). I use default demand scaling: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) to reflect steady demand with no clear regime shift. sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples) to match historical volatility. These parameters keep base-stock tied to observed mean demand while keeping safety stock modest given equal profit/holding tradeoff (q=profit/(profit+holding)=2/(2+1)=0.666..).

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time = 0 periods confirmed (evidence: Period 1-9 concludes show arrivals same period; e.g. Period 1 conclude: ordered on Period 1 arrived=278, lead_time 0).

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/22. Product: womens fine-knit trainer socks; recent demand elevated since Period 6 (higher weekly sales). Concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 0, so use promised/default L=0. I detect a demand regime change starting Period 6 (demands: P6-10 = [329,415,382,322,308]); I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the higher recent mean and volatility. This sets mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_recent \u2248 351.20 to target service while avoiding excess holding, and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std_recent \u2248 45.36 to reflect observed variability and produce an appropriate safety stock via the OR backend.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/29. Recent concluded history (Periods 1\u201311) consistently shows orders arriving same period => actual lead time = 0. Demand in the last 11 concluded periods has mean \u2248364.27 and std \u224882.0. No evidence of a persistent changepoint in demand or lost shipments. Use promised/default lead time (0) to keep policy aligned with observed arrivals. Set mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) = 364.27 to target average demand for the review+lead period. Set sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples) = 82.0 to reflect observed variability; this balances service level (through base-stock) against holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/6. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Concluded history (Periods 1\u201312) consistently shows arrivals same period as order (lead_time=0). No calendar anomalies detected for this basic sock SKU. Use defaults: promised lead time=0 is validated by concluded arrivals; demand history (samples [231,255,302,272,272]) shows mean 266.4 and std ~23.296. Setting L to promised 0 and using default mu_hat and sigma_hat keeps the OR engine's base-stock forecast anchored to observed demand while avoiding overreaction to recent demand noise.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/13. Demand context: historical sample mean=266.4 (samples [231,255,302,272,272]) and recent realized demands (Periods 1\u201313) show higher variability but no persistent regime shift; on-hand=110, in-transit=0, recent concludes confirm same-period arrivals. I set L to promised 0 (evidence: consecutive concludes showing lead_time=0). Using default mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples)=266.4 captures the baseline demand estimate while keeping the estimate stable given limited sample size. sigma_hat uses default sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples)=26.04 to reflect observed variability. These conservative defaults provide a balanced base-stock target: sufficient stock to cover expected demand this period (L+1=1) while avoiding excessive holding cost given holding=$1/unit and profit=$2/unit.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20. No external news; SKU is seasonal-basic socks. Historical concludes (Periods 1-14) consistently show arrivals same period as order => actual lead time = 0. On-hand=97, in-transit=0 so available stock is low relative to recent weekly demand (~356/week). I set L using confirmed actual lead time (default promised L=0). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using defaults over all observed demand samples (Periods 1-14): mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(demand)=356.214, sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(demand)=82.86. These parameters ask the OR engine to target a base-stock around the recent average weekly demand with measured volatility, balancing service (profit $2 vs holding $1 implies moderate service level) and avoiding excess holding given on-hand=97 and no pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time = 0 periods confirmed by Period 1-14 conclude messages (arrivals occurred same period as order).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). Product: women's fine-knit trainer socks. History of conclude messages (Periods 1\u201315) consistently shows orders arriving same period they were placed \u2192 actual lead time = 0. Current inventory: on-hand=20, in-transit=0. Demand history seed (provided samples) mean=266.4, std\u224823.30. I set L to the observed lead time (0) to match concluded evidence. I use default demand estimates (mu_hat = (1+L)*mean; sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std) so the OR engine computes a base-stock appropriate to observed demand variability while avoiding overreacting to recent week-to-week noise. This balances service level (profit $2 vs stockout cost) against $1 holding cost.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03 (Period 17). History shows consistent same-period arrivals (lead_time=0 confirmed through Period 16). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, so any order this period will arrive same period demand occurs. Recent demand (Periods 12-16 = [438,267,275,348,370]) shows a sustained upward regime vs earlier samples; I use a recent-5 estimate to capture this shift. Set L to promised (0). mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(recent 5) = 339.6 to target service for the higher recent demand. sigma_hat = std(recent 5) = 70.93 to reflect observed volatility and let the OR engine size safety stock accordingly.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime increased starting Period 12; recent mean 339.6 (Periods12-16) vs earlier sample mean ~266; lead_time remains 0 (confirmed through Period16).

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10 (Period 18). Lead time has been confirmed 0 periods through Period 17 (multiple conclude messages show same-period arrivals). Demand regime increased starting Period 12: recent 5-period mean (Periods12-16) = 339.6 vs earlier ~266. I set L to promised/default 0 because concludes consistently confirm 0. I set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the higher demand regime: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(Periods12-16) = 339.6. Sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility: std(Periods12-16) \u2248 70.93, scaled by sqrt(1+L)=1. These parameters raise the base-stock to target higher service for the new regime while keeping holding exposure accounted for via the OR engine's cap and cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime increased starting Period 12; recent mean 339.6 (Periods12-16) vs earlier ~266; lead_time remains 0 (confirmed through Period17).

No overdue shipments. Set L to promised (0) since concluded history consistently shows 0. Forecast demand using recent regime (Periods12-16) where mean=339.6 to capture higher demand; use N=5. Volatility estimated from same 5-sample window (std\u224863.44) to reflect observed variation. These params raise the base-stock to meet the higher demand regime while keeping holding risk visible to the OR engine (profit/holding -> q used downstream).

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent concluded history (Periods 1\u201319) consistently shows actual lead time = 0. Demand shifted higher starting Period 12; using recent data (Periods 12\u201319) captures the new regime while avoiding older lower-demand samples. I set L to the observed average lead time (0). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the last 8 concluded demands (Periods 12\u201319) to reflect the elevated regime: mean demand \u2248327.875 and sample std \u224853.570, so mu_hat=(1+L)*mean=327.875 and sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std=53.570. These parameters raise the base-stock to meet higher demand while sigma captures observed variability, balancing service level and holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1 (q=0.666...).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime increased starting Period 12; recent mean (Periods12\u201319)=327.9 vs earlier ~266; actual lead time remains 0 (confirmed through Period19).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/8 (Period 22). On-hand=9, in-transit=0; lead time has been 0 periods consistently through Period 21 (conclude history). Demand regime increased starting Period 12; recent demand (Periods 12\u201321) average = 322.9 units/week. To balance service vs holding cost with confirmed L=0, I use a recent_N demand estimate (N=10, Periods12\u201321) to capture the new higher mean and recent volatility. This yields mu_hat=(1+L)*mean_recent=322.9 and sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std_recent\u224850.25. These parameters raise the base-stock to meet current higher demand while keeping safety stock tuned to observed variability; low on-hand and zero in-transit justify ordering to the new target.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-07-15 Period 23. On-hand=33, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 periods through Period 22. Demand regime shifted up starting Period 12; recent demands (Periods12\u201322) average ~322 units/week with elevated variance. To follow the new regime and keep service while avoiding excess holding, I set L to promised 0 (confirmed), use a recent-N forecast for mu_hat using Periods12\u201322 (N=11) to capture the higher mean, and estimate sigma_hat from the same recent window to reflect current volatility. These parameters give the OR backend an up-to-date base-stock reflecting higher demand but keep cap calculations aware of measured variability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime increase starting Period 12; recent mean (Periods12\u201322)=322.0 units/week; actual lead time remains 0 (confirmed through Period22).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-22 (Period 24). Historical concludes through Period 23 consistently show actual lead time = 0. Demand shifted up starting Period 12; recent sample (Periods 12\u201323) mean demand = 324.5 units/week. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we need orders to cover current demand. I set L to promised/default (0) because all concludes confirm same-period arrivals. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the detected regime (Periods 12+; N=12) to capture the higher mean and current volatility. These parameters raise the base-stock to meet the increased demand while sigma captures observed variability so the OR engine balances service level vs holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime increased starting Period 12 (evidence: Periods12\u201323 mean=324.5 units/week vs earlier ~266); actual lead time = 0 confirmed through Period 23.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29 (Period 25). On-hand=69, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 (arrivals same period through Period 24). Demand regime shift detected starting Period 12; Periods 12\u201323 mean=324.5 units/week with moderate dispersion. No overdue shipments to reconcile. I set L to promised/default (0) because concludes consistently show 0. I set mu_hat using recent_N over the detected regime (Periods12\u201323, N=12) to capture the higher ongoing demand (mu_hat = (1+L)*mean = 324.5). I set sigma_hat using recent_N (same N=12) to reflect current volatility (std \u224845.87); with L=0 the scaling is 1. These parameters align the OR backend base-stock toward the higher recent demand while keeping safety stock proportional to observed variability, balancing service rate (profit $2/unit) against holding cost ($1/unit/period).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Demand regime increased starting Period 12; recent sample (Periods12\u201325) mean demand = 316.214 units/week with std \u224849.01. On-hand=70, in-transit=0, promised lead time=0 and historical concludes confirm actual L=0. To keep service while limiting holding cost, set L estimate to observed lead-time average (0), use a recent_N demand estimate over the detected regime (N=14) for mu_hat, and sigma_hat from the same recent sample.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime increased starting Period 12 (evidence: Periods12\u201325 mean=316.2 units/week vs earlier ~266); actual lead time = 0 confirmed through Period 25.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/12 (Period 27). Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 consistently; demand regime increased starting Period 12. Evidence: Periods12\u201326 demands mean=312.33 (n=15) vs earlier ~266; recent volatility (std) \u224849.56. On-hand=80, in-transit=0 so we must replenish to a base-stock that reflects the higher regime while keeping holding cost in check. I set L=0 (confirmed). I set mu_hat using recent_N over the post-changepoint regime (Periods12\u201326, N=15) to capture the sustained higher demand. I set sigma_hat using recent_N (same N) to reflect observed variability. These parameters push the OR engine to target a higher base-stock consistent with the new demand level while the sigma preserves appropriate safety stock for service vs holding tradeoff.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime increased starting Period 12 (evidence: Periods12\u201326 mean=312.33 units/week vs earlier ~266); actual lead time confirmed 0 through Period 26.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-08-19 (Period 28). Historical concludes through Period 27 confirm actual lead time = 0. Demand regime shifted up starting Period 12; recent periods (Periods 12\u201326, N=15) show a higher mean demand ~312.33 units/week vs earlier ~266. On-hand = 33, in-transit = 0 so current stock is well below the realized weekly demand; with lead time 0 we must order to restore service while balancing $1 holding cost. I set L to the promised/confirmed 0. I set mu_hat using a recent_N forecast (N=15, covering the new high-demand regime) so the backend targets the higher base-stock appropriate for the regime. I set sigma_hat to an explicit volatility estimate (40 units) to reflect observed week-to-week variability and avoid understocking given the demand jump. These parameters push the OR engine to replenish toward the new higher target while capping order size via the engine's cap.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime increased starting Period 12; recent mean (Periods12\u201326)=312.33 units/week vs earlier ~266; actual lead time confirmed 0 through Period 27.

Set L=default (promised 0). mu_hat = (1+L)*mean of last 17 demands = 310.588 (captures current higher demand). sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std of last 17 demands = 46.640 (captures observed volatility). These parameters raise the base-stock to serve the higher recent demand while keeping safety stock proportional to observed variability, balancing service vs holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=102, in-transit=0 so we must replenish to cover expected next-period demand. I set L=default (promised lead time 0) because concluded history consistently shows 0. For demand I use recent_N to capture the post-change regime (Periods12\u201329, regime length=18) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(demand Periods12\u201329)=306.06 units. For volatility I use recent_N (same 18 samples) to reflect current variability; sample std \u224849.17 so sigma_hat = 49.17. These parameters align the OR backend base-stock to the higher-demand regime while keeping safety stock tuned to observed volatility, balancing service level (reduce stockouts) against holding cost.

Lead time remains 0 (confirmed through Period 31 concludes). Demand regime elevated starting Period 12; I use the recent regime (Periods 12\u201330, N=19) to set demand forecast. Set L to promised (default) = 0. Set mu_hat using recent_N to (1+L)*mean of Periods12\u201330 = 304.37 units (covers review+lead). Set sigma_hat using recent_N = sample std of Periods12\u201330 \u2248 48.34 to reflect current volatility. These choices keep base stock aligned with the higher ongoing demand while L=0 keeps pipeline short to limit holding cost given relatively high turnover.

For demand I use a recent_N estimate to capture the higher post-changepoint regime: take the last N=20 samples (Periods 13\u201332) where mean demand = 292.35 units/week; mu_hat = (1+L)*mean = 292.35. Volatility estimated from the same 20-sample window: sample std \u2248 37.74, sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std = 37.74. These parameters anchor the OR base-stock to the updated higher mean while keeping lead time at the confirmed 0, balancing service (profit $2 vs holding $1) with moderate safety stock via the observed sigma.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-07 (Period 35). On-hand=9, in-transit=0. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 0 (orders arriving same period through Period 34). Demand regime increased starting Period 12; using the most recent stable regime improves forecast. I choose L = recent confirmed 0 (promised=0, confirmed by conclude history). For demand I use recent_N (N=20, most recent 20 weeks Period15\u201334) to capture current higher regime while limiting noise from older data. mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last 20 demands) = 301.1 units (targets service while avoiding excess holding given holding cost=$1/unit). sigma_hat = std(last 20 demands) scaled by sqrt(1+L) \u2248 50.0 units to represent observed volatility and set safety stock via the OR backend.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed 0 periods through Period 34 (evidence: conclude messages show arrivals same period). Demand regime increased starting Period 12; recent 20-week mean (Periods15\u201334)=301.1 units/week (was ~266 earlier).

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Lead time remains reliably 0 (concluded through Period 35). Demand regime increased starting Period 12; use recent regime stats to avoid diluting with earlier lower demand. Set L to promised (0) per confirmed concludes. For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=20 (Periods15\u201334) \u2014 carry-over mean=301.1 units/week \u2014 to align base stock to the new higher regime. Volatility estimated at sigma_hat=50.0 (sqrt(1+L)*std \u224850) to capture observed week-to-week fluctuations and preserve service while limiting excess holding given holding cost=$1/unit. These parameters give the OR engine a higher base-stock reflecting the new regime and a reasonable cap via its cap formula.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Lead time remains 0 (confirmed repeatedly through Period 36 concludes). Demand regime has been higher since Period 12; to reflect the sustained elevated demand I use a recent-20 estimate for mean (captures the post-change regime while balancing sample size). I set sigma conservatively above historical week-to-week variability to maintain service (reduces stockouts given high profit-to-hold ratio). Parameters aim to keep base-stock near recent demand while capping single-period orders per OR engine rules.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 through Period 37 and a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 12. I use a recent-20 estimate (Periods 15\u201334) capturing the post-change mean (301.1 units/week) to forecast (1+L)-period demand and same-window std (44.42) for volatility.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/04 (Period 39). On-hand=34, in-transit=0 \u2014 low visible cover and no pipeline. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 through Period 38 and a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 12. I use L=promised (0) because concludes consistently show same-period arrivals. Demand forecast uses recent_N with N=20 (Periods 19\u201338) to capture the current regime while capping N at 20 per policy. Mean demand (Periods19\u201338)=290.05 units/week -> mu_hat=(1+L)*mean=290.05. Sample std(dev) of those 20 weeks = 42.19 -> sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std = 42.19. These parameters keep the base stock tuned to the elevated regime while reflecting observed variability; with profit=$2 and holding=$1 the OR backend will target a moderate service level (q\u22480.667) without overstocking given low on-hand and no in-transit.

For demand I use recent_N with N=20 (last 20 weeks, Periods20\u201339) to reflect the post-changepoint regime; mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last20)=285.4 units. Volatility uses recent_N with same N: sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(last20)=42.22 units.

Recent demand regime upshift (starts ~Period12) => target demand = recent 20-week mean \u2248301.1 units/week; on-hand=52, in-transit=0 so we need orders to replenish to that target. Set mu_hat to (1+L)*recent_mean to capture the new regime. Volatility has been moderate; use recent 20-week std \u224845 to size safety stock. These parameters keep base-stock aligned with the higher recent demand while avoiding excessive holding given holding cost=1 vs profit=2 (service quantile \u22480.667).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25. No special calendar events; product is basic womens socks. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 through Period 41. On-hand=93, in-transit=0 so no incoming stock visible. Demand regime uplift since Period 12; I use the most recent 20 weeks (Periods 22\u201341) to capture current mean/volatility for ordering. Setting L to promised(0) keeps arrivals same-period as historically observed; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N=20 to reflect the higher-but-variable demand and limit holding cost exposure.

Carry-over insight: Lead time remains 0 periods (confirmed through Period 41); sustained demand regime increase starting Period 12 \u2014 recent 20-week mean (Periods22\u201341)=278.2 units/week vs earlier ~266.

LLM Rationale:

Demand shows a sustained higher regime since Period 12; recent 20-week mean (Periods22\u201341) = 278.2 units/week per carry-over insight. With lead time 0, set review+lead demand (mu_hat) to the recent 20-week mean to reflect the elevated regime and avoid overreacting to older low-demand samples. Use a recent-20 estimate of sigma (volatility) to capture current variability around that mean. These settings bias orders toward meeting current demand while limiting holding cost exposure given holding=$1 vs profit=$2 (service quantile moderate). No new carry-over insights to record.

For demand I use the default full-sample estimates: mean demand over Periods 1\u201343 = 309.0 units \u2192 mu_hat = (1+L)*mean = 309.0. Volatility estimated from full-history; std \u2248 70.0 \u2192 sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std = 70.0. These parameters keep the OR backend anchored to the observed higher demand while using the confirmed 0 lead time; the chosen service quantile (q=profit/(profit+holding)=2/3) will be translated by the OR engine into the appropriate safety stock (z\u22480.43) balancing stockouts vs holding cost.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16 (Period 45). History shows consistent actual lead time = 0 (arrivals same period through Period 44) and a sustained higher-demand regime vs very early periods. On-hand=126, in-transit=0; expected demand ~307/week so current inventory covers <0.5 week \u2014 need target stock to cover (1+L) review+lead demand. I set L=default (promised 0) because concludes confirm 0. mu_hat set to the default (1+L)\xd7mean(all historical weekly demands) to reflect the full-history observed mean demand (~307 units). sigma_hat set to the default sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) to reflect observed volatility (~71.4). These parameters give the OR backend a base-stock anchored to the empirical mean and measured variability, balancing service level (capture higher recent demand) against holding cost.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/23 (Period 46). On-hand=102, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 periods; demand regime shifted up starting Period 12 (sustained higher mean vs earlier). I choose promised/default lead time = 0 (consistent with many conclude messages). For demand I use the OR-default (all-sample) estimators to avoid overfitting short-term noise while capturing the sustained higher regime: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all demands) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all demands). This yields a base-stock that balances service (captures elevated mean) against holding costs given current modest on-hand and no pipeline. Defaults also align with the OR engine's assumptions so the capped order will be computed robustly.

Daily Reward (R_t): $340.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30. Lead time has been consistently 0 (confirmed through Period 46). Recent demand shows a modest downshift vs earlier elevated regime; last 20 weeks (Periods27\u201346) mean demand = 263.45 units/week, std \u224856.53. On-hand=108, in-transit=0 so we need to replenish for the upcoming single-period demand. I set L to the promised/default 0 (confirmed historically). I set mu_hat using recent_N (N=20) to capture the most recent demand regime including the holiday dip, giving a conservative one-period forecast. sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=20) to reflect recent volatility; these params will produce a base-stock that balances the $2/unit profit (service) vs $1/unit holding cost.
