Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. No on-hand or in-transit inventory; initial history only (demands [231,255,302,272,272]). Promised lead time is 2 periods and no concluded arrivals to suggest deviation. Use default lead time (promised=2) and default demand estimates so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from full sample. This keeps forecasts anchored to available history while avoiding overreaction to absent arrival data.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Historical demands = [231,255,302,272,272] (mean=266.4).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Recent history: one concluded arrival shows an actual lead time of 1 (Period 2 conclude: ordered on Period 1, lead_time was 1). Demand history samples = [231,255,302,272,272] (mean=266.4). I set L via calculate to let backend average observed lead times (captures observed 1-period lead). For demand I use default so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples (with L inferred by backend) to reflect full review+lead demand. sigma_hat uses default to scale historical volatility by sqrt(1+L). This conservative choice uses all demand history and the observed shorter lead time to reduce excess pipeline while maintaining service.

Carry-over insight: Observed actual lead time = 1 period (Period 2 conclude: ordered on Period 1, lead_time was 1).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/4 (Period 4). On-hand=0, in-transit=374 (order placed in Period 3 arriving during Period 4). Historical demands mean=266.4 (samples [231,255,302,272,272]). Two concluded arrivals show lead_time=1 in both observed periods \u2192 treat actual lead time as 1. Choose L by "calculate" to use observed lead times average. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend sets (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std, ensuring coverage of (L+1)=2 periods of demand while letting OR engine balance profit vs holding cost.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/11 (Period 5). Recent realized demands jumped (Periods 2-4: 548, 399, 338) versus older samples; last order (ordered in Period 4) did not arrive when prior orders consistently had lead_time=1, suggesting a lost shipment rather than a stable increase in lead time. Use observed lead-time history to let backend compute average (captures the earlier consistent 1-period LT). For demand, place emphasis on the recent high-demand regime (last 3 periods) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect current elevated mean and volatility and drive larger replenishment to avoid stockouts. This balances higher service needs (profit > holding cost) against holding cost by increasing base stock via recent demand estimates while keeping LT estimate data-driven.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime increased starting Period 2: recent-period mean (Periods 2-4) \u2248 428 units vs earlier mean ~266; treat as sustained until contradicted. Last order (Period 4) likely lost\u2014prior observed lead_time was 1 period (Periods 2\u20133 conclude).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. Recent history shows observed lead times [1,1,2] (avg\u22481.33) and a demand regime shift upward starting Period 2 (Periods 2\u20134 mean \u2248428 vs earlier \u2248266). On-hand=122, in-transit=549; one recent order (Period 4) likely lost but subsequent arrivals confirm variable lead time. I select L by averaging observed lead times to let the OR backend account for the apparent increase in variability (method: calculate). For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=3 (Periods 2\u20134) to capture the higher-demand regime when computing (1+L)\xd7mean. For sigma_hat I use recent_N N=3 to reflect volatility in the new regime. These settings bias base-stock up to protect service under higher demand and variable lead time while keeping variance estimates localized to recent behavior.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). Recent concludes show mixed lead times: observed lead times = {1,1,2} with a lost/late arrival signal for the order placed in Period 4 (no arrival by Period 6). Demand regime increased starting Period 2 (Periods 2\u20134 mean \u2248428 vs earlier ~266). To capture the sustained higher demand I use a recent_N demand estimate (N=3 for Periods 2\u20134). For lead time I use the calculated average of observed lead times to reflect the 1.33-period realized lead time and the possibility of occasional 2-period outcomes/lost shipments (backend will round/handle). Sigma uses recent_N (N=3) to reflect volatility in the new regime. These choices raise base stock to cover the higher demand across the review+lead period and account for observed lead-time variability and missing arrivals.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/1 (Period 8). Demand has been elevated since Period 2 (large demands in Periods 2\u20137) and recent history shows variability. On-hand=0, in-transit=642. Concluded lead times: 1 (Period2), 1 (Period3), 2 (Period5) \u2192 lead time appears variable (1\u20132) and some orders (Period4 ordered=332) did not arrive and are likely lost. I set L by averaging the last 3 observed lead times to capture recent variability. For demand I treat the sustained higher-demand regime starting Period2 as active (regime length = 6 periods, Periods 2\u20137) and use recent_N with N=6 so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current elevated mean and volatility across the review+lead period. These choices aim to raise target base stock to improve service under elevated demand while acknowledging increased lead-time uncertainty and past lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Lead time regime is variable: observed lead times = 1,1,2 (Periods 2,3,5 conclude); some orders (e.g. Period 4 ordered=332) appear lost\u2014treat lead time as 1\u20132 with risk of lost shipments until contradicted.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08 (Period 9). Recent concluded arrivals show variable lead times (most recent observed lead times = 3,2,1 \u2192 avg \u22482). Demand has been elevated vs initial snapshot (recent demands P4\u2013P8 = [338,252,329,415,382], recent mean \u2248343). On-hand=0, in-transit=512; some prior orders were lost/delayed, so assume lead time 1\u20133 with central estimate 2 to avoid under-ordering. I set L to recent_N (N=3) to reflect the most recent lead-time regime. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N (N=5) to capture the elevated recent demand regime (use last 5 demands) so the backend's base-stock will cover (1+L) periods of higher demand while sigma reflects recent volatility. This balances service (avoid stockouts given lost shipments) against holding cost by using short recent windows rather than long historical averages.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). Recent history shows variable/lengthening lead times and some lost shipments (several orders never concluded). Demand has been elevated since Period 2; recent 5-period demand (Periods 5\u20139 = 252,329,415,382,322) averages ~340. To balance service vs holding given profit=$2 and holding=$1 and current in-transit=724, I estimate lead time from the most recent observed lead-time samples to capture the 1\u20133 period variability, and use recent 5-sample demand statistics to reflect the higher regime while limiting responsiveness to single-period noise. Methods chosen: L = recent_N (N=5) to average recent lead-time observations; mu_hat = recent_N (N=5) to forecast (1+L)*recent mean demand; sigma_hat = recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. This addresses missing shipments by using recent lead-time behavior rather than the promised default and by sizing orders to recent elevated demand.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/22 Period 11. On-hand=0, in-transit=724. Observed lead times variable (recent concludes show 3,2,1); some orders lost or hugely delayed. Demand recent 5-period mean (Periods 6\u201310) \u2248 351 units \u2014 lower than the earlier spike but still elevated versus original samples. To react to variable/short lead times while adapting to recent demand, set L using the most recent lead-time observations (N=3) and set demand and volatility using the last 5 demand samples so the OR backend targets stock for the current elevated regime while keeping safety buffer for lead-time noise.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). On-hand=0, in-transit=519. Historical concluded lead times recent sequence = [2,1,2,3,2,1,1] (avg ~1.7) with variability and some lost shipments; demand has shifted up (recent higher demands vs initial 5-sample mean). To protect service given variable 1\u20133 period arrivals and elevated demand, I set lead time estimate to the recent average (biasing toward 2), and use recent-window demand and volatility to capture the higher recent mean and higher dispersion. This increases pipeline coverage while letting the OR backend compute exact base_stock and cap. Methods chosen also hedge against lost/late shipments by using a multi-period (N=5) recent view.

LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=0, in-transit=775. Historical concluded lead times (chronological): 1,1,2,3,2,1,2 \u2192 recent variability with median ~2 and mean ~1.7; some orders appear lost/delayed (e.g. Period 4 order). Demand recent history (Periods 8-12): [382,322,308,427,438] shows a higher regime vs older seed data. To balance service vs holding cost given variable lead times and sustained higher demand, I (1) set L using recent observed lead times (focus on last 5 observed leads => average \u22482) to protect against 1\u20133 period tails and risk of delayed shipments; (2) set mu_hat using recent demand (last 5 periods) to capture the elevated demand regime; (3) set sigma_hat using recent volatility (last 5 demands) to reflect current variability. These choices increase target pipeline to avoid stockouts given in-transit uncertainty while keeping holding exposure aligned to recent demand variance.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/13 (Period 14). On-hand=0, in-transit=787. Historical concluded lead times show variability (1,1,2,3,2,1,2) with some lost arrivals; recent concluded leads skew ~1\u20132 with occasional 3. Demand regime increased starting Period 2 (recent-period mean ~428 vs earlier ~266). To be responsive to the higher-demand regime while accounting for variable/occasionally long lead times and lost shipments, I estimate lead time from the most recent observed leads (recent_N=3) and base demand forecast and volatility on the most recent demand regime (recent_N=3) so the OR engine raises targets promptly without over-committing inventory.

Carry-over insight: Lead time regime variable with observed leads 1\u20133 periods and risk of lost shipments; demand regime increased from Period 2 with recent mean \u2248428 (treat as sustained until contradicted).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/20 (Period 15). On-hand=0, in-transit=557. Observed concluded lead times (from history): [1,1,2,3,2,1,2,2] \u2192 recent variability 1\u20133 with recent values clustering near 1\u20132. Demand regime increased starting Period 2 and has remained elevated; use recent-demand estimate to capture sustained higher demand. I choose L=recent_N with N=3 to reflect the most recent lead-time behavior (avg of last 3 observed lead times \u22481.67, captures 1\u20132 regime while allowing occasional 3). For mu_hat use recent_N with N=13 to base the (1+L)\xd7mean on the sustained high-demand regime since Period 2 (N=13 covers the regime length while capping per rules). Sigma_hat use default to let backend compute \u221a(1+L)\xd7std over all samples \u2014 conservative given variable lead times and some lost shipments. These choices bias orders upward to protect service under observed higher demand and 1\u20132 period lead times while relying on backend volatility calc for safety against shipment variability and lost shipments.

LLM Rationale:
Lead times have been variable with some lost shipments; recent observed lead times (last 5) average ~2 so use recent_N to capture current regime. Demand spiked earlier but recent realised demands are volatile; use recent_N (last 5 periods) for mu_hat to reflect current demand level. sigma_hat uses default (all-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L)) so backend retains broad uncertainty.

Historical concluded lead times = [1,1,2,3,2,1,2,2] (avg\u22481.75) and several lost/late shipments observed; demand regime rose starting Period 2 (recent mean \u2248428). To balance service vs holding given profit=$2 / hold=$1, set L using calculated average lead time to capture observed variability; set demand and volatility using recent regime samples (Periods 2\u201316, N=15) so mu_hat reflects the higher sustained demand and sigma_hat captures recent variability. This helps the OR backend size orders for the higher-demand regime while accounting for lead-time risk and avoiding excessive holding.

Historical concluded lead times vary (observed 1\u20133 periods) with some lost shipments; demand has shifted up since Period 2 (recent periods higher). I choose L=calculate to let backend use the average of observed lead times (captures variable 1\u20133 regime). For demand I select recent_N (N=5) to bias mu_hat toward the recent higher-demand regime while keeping sample size reasonable. Sigma uses default to reflect overall observed volatility scaled by (1+L). These choices balance service (higher mu_hat for increased demand and variable lead time) against holding cost given large in-transit volume.

To balance service vs holding cost I set L to be calculated from observed lead times (captures 1\u20133 variability). Demand has softened vs earlier spikes; use a recent_N mu_hat (N=5, last five demands Periods15\u201319) so the forecast reflects current demand (~328 avg) rather than older high values. Keep sigma_hat as default to let backend use full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L).

Recent demand has moderated vs earlier spikes; use recent 5-period stats so mu_hat and sigma_hat respond to latest realized demand. Methods chosen: L=recent_N (N=5) to capture current lead-time regime average; mu_hat=recent_N (N=5) to scale (1+L) by the mean of the last 5 demands; sigma_hat=recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent demand volatility.

To capture the recent variable lead-time regime and the sustained higher demand, use recent_N=5 for lead time estimation (averages most recent observed leads) and recent_N=5 for demand mean and volatility so the OR backend builds base-stock over the (1+L) horizon reflecting current demand and recent variability.

Historical concludes show variable actual lead times (observed values ~1\u20133; average \u22481.9) and evidence of lost shipments; demand regime increased from Period 2 (recent higher demands ~300\u2013438). To reflect variable/short lead time but account for observed variability I set L=calculate (use avg observed). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the higher recent demand regime rather than the older low baseline. For volatility I use recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent demand variability. These choices raise target base-stock to cover the elevated recent demand while L=calculate informs the backend of the empiric lead-time to mitigate stockouts given risky deliveries.

LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=0, in-transit=748. History shows variable/unstable lead times with some lost shipments; recent observed lead times vary 1\u20133. Recent demand has moderated (~~300s) vs earlier spikes. To be conservative vs lost/variable arrivals, set L by averaging the most recent observed lead times (recent_N=5). Forecast demand using the most recent 5 periods to capture current regime. Keep sigma at default (uses all samples) so backend retains full volatility view.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/5 (Period 26). Observed lead times have varied (recent observed W\u2208{1,2,3}) and some shipments appear lost; on-hand=0, in-transit=748. Demand regime elevated vs initial sample (historical concludes show frequent demands ~300\u2013430 when stocked). To be responsive to the recent higher/variable lead-time regime and elevated demand, I set lead time and demand estimates using recent averages (capture most recent signal) while using default volatility. This balances service (avoid stockouts given in-transit still uncertain) against holding cost.

Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=0, in-transit=748. Observed concluded lead times are variable (1\u20133); using the average of all observed lead times to capture this variability. Demand has shown elevated regimes earlier; to make the forecast responsive to recent realized demand levels, use a recent-N mean (last 5 periods) for mu_hat while keeping sigma_hat default. These choices aim to cover (1+L) periods of demand given uncertain/variable lead time and reduce stockout risk given large in-transit but history of lost shipments.

Period 28 (2019-08-19). Recent history shows variable actual lead times (1\u20133) with some lost shipments and a long string of zero arrivals since Period 17; on-hand=0, in-transit=748. To reflect observed lead-time variability and let the backend average empirical lead times, set L=calculate. Demand has no clear fresh upward regime in the most recent many periods (recent demands ~250\u2013350), so use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend uses all samples) to avoid overreacting to earlier spikes. This balances service vs holding cost given high in-transit quantity and uncertain arrivals.

Observed lead times in concluded history are variable (sequence: 1,1,2,3,2,1,2,2,3) \u2192 average \u22481.89, so use calculated average lead time to reflect variability and risk of delayed/lost shipments. Recent demand has moderated vs earlier spike; use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to anchor forecast to the last 5 realized demands and avoid overstock from older high-demand regime. Use default sigma_hat to let backend compute volatility across all samples scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances service (capture variable lead time) vs holding cost given in-transit inventory and uncertain arrivals.

Historical concluded lead times vary (observed W = [1,1,2,3,2,1,2,2,3], avg \u22481.89) and some orders appear lost; demand history shows elevated and variable demand. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the average observed lead time (captures 1\u20133 variability). I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as 'default' so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, letting the OR engine balance service level vs holding cost while reflecting the inferred lead time. This approach is conservative given in-transit stock and risk of lost shipments.

LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). On-hand=0, in-transit=748. Historical concluded lead times variable (1\u20133); recent concluded leads lean higher (last concludes include lead_time=3,2,3) and some lost shipments earlier\u2014treat lead time as 2-period average. Recent demand on-hand observations (Periods 28\u201332) show lower stable demand (~248\u2013294); use recent data to set demand forecast and volatility so orders match near-term consumption and avoid excess holding given $1 holding vs $2 profit. Methods: L recent_N=3 to capture current 1\u20133 variability; mu_hat recent_N=5 to base (1+L)\xd7mean on the most recent stable demand window; sigma_hat recent_N=5 to capture recent volatility. This balances service-level against holding cost and acknowledges risk of lost shipments by not inflating lead time explicitly.

Historical concluded lead times show variability (observed sequence 1,1,2,3,2,1,2,2,3 \u2192 mean \u22481.9) and some lost shipments; demand samples remain the provided series with a higher recent regime flagged earlier. To balance service vs holding cost given variable/mostly ~2-period actual lead time, set L to be estimated from observed lead times (calculate). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, letting the backend incorporate the chosen L when computing base stock. This conservative choice leverages observed lead-time average while keeping demand/statistics grounding in full sample history to avoid overfitting to short-term noise and to mitigate risk from lost shipments.

Lead time observations historically variable (1\u20133), so use aggregated observed average to let backend infer typical L from concluded arrivals. Demand has shown a sustained higher regime earlier; use recent_N for mu_hat to bias forecast toward recent observed demand. sigma_hat left as default to let backend compute volatility from full history. This balances service (use recent demand) against holding cost given large in-transit stock.

LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). On-hand=0, in-transit=748. Historical concluded lead times vary (1\u20133) with occasional lost shipments; recent variability remains. Recent observed demand (Periods 31\u201335) ~ [254,248,405,312,266] \u2014 use a recent-window forecast to capture current regime. Choose L by averaging the most recent observed lead times to reflect variable 1\u20133 periods. Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=5) to base (1+L)-period demand and volatility on the last 5 demand observations so the OR backend adapts to the current demand level while the large in-transit position provides some buffer against lost shipments.

Historical concluded lead times vary (observed 1\u20133 periods across arrive records through Period 17), indicating a variable 1\u20133 period regime with some lost shipments. Demand history shows a higher regime beginning around Period 2; recent variability is present. Chosen L method 'calculate' uses the average of observed lead times to reflect the variable regime rather than trusting the promised 2. mu_hat uses 'recent_N' with N=5 to weight recent demand levels (captures the elevated recent demands while limiting noise). sigma_hat uses 'default' to let backend compute volatility across all samples scaled by sqrt(1+L). These choices balance service level (through mu_hat tuned to recent demand) against holding costs (sigma_hat default keeps uncertainty-driven safety stock moderate) and acknowledge risk of lost shipments by using observed average lead time.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/10/28 (Period 38). On-hand=0, in-transit=748. Historical concluded lead times vary (1\u20133 periods, some lost shipments); use aggregated estimate for L. No strong new demand regime evidence since prior insights; rely on backend defaults for demand forecast and volatility so orders reflect full-sample mean scaled by (1+L). This balances service (cover uncertain lead time) vs holding cost given large in-transit stock.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/4 (Period 39). On-hand=0, in-transit=748. Historical concludes show variable lead times (1\u20133) and risk of lost shipments; demand observations since Period 2 remain elevated vs the very early baseline. To be robust to uncertain/occasionally longer lead times while protecting service, keep L at promised (default) so backend assumes 2, raise mu_hat explicitly to cover (1+L) periods of expected demand using a conservative demand forecast (~330/week) \u2192 mu_hat=3*330=990. Keep sigma_hat default to let backend compute volatility from full history. This increases target base-stock to protect against lost/late arrivals while relying on backend volatility estimate for safety.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019/11/11). On-hand=0, in-transit=1039. History shows variable actual lead times (1\u20133) and some lost shipments; demand evidence is mixed but long-run samples are available. To hedge lead-time variability and risk of lost shipments I use a recent average lead-time estimate (recent_N=5) while leaving demand and volatility to the backend defaults so base_stock scales with (1+L)\xd7historical mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This keeps ordering responsive to inferred short-term L changes while relying on full-sample demand stats to avoid overfitting to sparse arrival-driven sales spikes.

Historical demand samples show elevated recent demand vs earlier but no new strong changepoint beyond prior insights; observed lead times have varied (1\u20133) with some lost shipments. Choose L='calculate' so backend uses the average of all observed lead times (captures variable regime). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting the OR engine balance service level (via profit/(profit+holding) quantile) against holding cost while incorporating the inferred average lead time.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Recent realized demand (Periods 37\u201341) average \u2248257. To balance service vs holding cost given pipeline present and lead-time variability, I set L to the recent-average of observed lead times (captures current 1\u20133 regime), mu_hat to a recent-5 demand estimate (focus on latest realized demand profile), and sigma_hat to default (uses full-sample volatility scaled by review+lead). This keeps orders responsive to recent demand while accounting for lead-time uncertainty and existing in-transit stock.

LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019/12/02). On-hand=0, in-transit=748. Historical concluded lead times vary (1\u20133 periods) with some lost shipments; demand has been higher since Period 2 (sustained regime). To let the OR engine use observed lead-time behavior, set L to be calculated from all observed lead times. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples; this leverages full history while letting OR compute safety stock given profit/holding tradeoff. With large in-transit volume, this avoids over-specifying demand forecasts and lets backend cap orders appropriately despite lost-shipment risk.

Demand regime has been higher since Period 2 (sustained). Choose L='calculate' to let backend use observed lead-time history average (captures variable 1\u20133 behavior). For demand forecast use recent_N with N=20 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (longer window but capped) so m\xfb=(1+L)*mean of most recent demand regime. For volatility use recent_N N=20 to reflect recent demand variability. These settings bias orders toward meeting the elevated demand while acknowledging pipeline uncertainty and risk of lost shipments.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/16 (Period 45). On-hand=0, in-transit=748. Historical concluded lead times have been variable (1\u20133) with some lost shipments, but promised lead time is 2 and recent confirmed arrival (Period 40 conclude) was lead=1\u2014no new conclusive shift since last insights. Demand seed samples mean \u2248266.4 (from provided historical samples). To be conservative given variable lead times but no new conclude evidence this period, use default promised L to keep the OR engine aligned with contract lead time. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this leverages the full sample set and keeps orders comparable to current pipeline (in-transit ~748 close to default base-stock). This balances service level against holding cost while we await new conclude messages to refine lead-time or demand regime.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/23 (Period 46). On-hand=0, in-transit=961 \u2014 large pipeline currently covering several weeks of demand; promised lead time=2 but observed lead times in history are variable (1\u20133) with occasional lost shipments. Demand history shows a prior sustained higher regime starting Period 2, but recent observed weekly demands (Periods 39\u201345) are mixed and uncertain. To be conservative given high in-transit inventory and lead-time variability, use promised lead time and default demand/volatility estimates so the OR backend applies its full-sample statistics and caps orders accordingly, avoiding aggressive fresh orders that risk overstock if some in-transit shipments still arrive.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30 (Period 47). On-hand=0, in-transit=748. Historical concluded lead times remain variable (recently dominated by 1 period arrivals but 1\u20133 observed historically) and demand has been in the higher regime (carry-over: demand increased from Period 2, recent mean \u2248428). To balance service vs holding cost while acknowledging variable/mostly-short lead times, I use recent_N estimates (N=5) for lead time, demand forecast and volatility so the OR backend adapts to the most recent regime without overreacting to single lost shipments. This keeps pipeline coverage tuned to the current high-demand regime and captures recent delivery speed.
