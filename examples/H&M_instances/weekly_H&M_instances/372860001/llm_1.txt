Lead time & pipeline: actual lead_time confirmed = 4 periods. On-hand=187, in-transit=885 \u2192 pipeline total=1,072. Decision logic: need coverage for (L+1)=5 periods of demand (demand forecast conservatively 250\u2013300/period given seasonal uplift). Five-period demand \u22481,250\u20131,500; current pipeline shortfall \u2248178\u2013428. Balance service level vs high holding cost ($1/unit/period) and modest profit ($2/unit). Place a moderate top-up to reduce stockout risk over the holiday spike while avoiding excessive holding costs. Order sized to cover expected shortfall with modest safety: 300 units.",

Period 47 (2019/12/30) VM Action:
============================================================
{
  "rationale": "World/calendar: Period 47 is 2019-12-30 (post-Christmas, New Year). Socks (basic trainer socks) see no strong New-Year spike; demand often softens after Xmas. Demand regime: recent concluded demands (Periods 43\u201346) = [143,209,231,224], avg \u2248201; previous carry-over indicates a lower-demand regime (~260) since Period 33 which appears to have softened further in late Dec. Lead time & pipeline: actual lead_time = 4 (confirmed). On-hand=223, in-transit=925 \u2192 total pipeline available = 1148. Decision timing: when ordering now, arrivals will occur in Period 51 (N+4) and only visible later. Coverage target: with L=4 need coverage for L+1=5 periods of demand. Forecast demand per period \u2248200 (conservative given recent avg ~201 and seasonal softness). Five-period demand \u22481,000 units. Assessment: pipeline 1,148 > 1,000 so no order required; avoid extra holding cost ($1/unit/period) which materially reduces reward given modest profit ($2/unit). Action: place zero order to minimize holding cost while maintaining high service level given current pipeline.",
