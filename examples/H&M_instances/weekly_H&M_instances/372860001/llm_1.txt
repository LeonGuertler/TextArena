Lead time: historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (orders placed Pn arrive Pn+4). Demand forecast: use recent 4-period average demand = (210+354+143+209)/4 = 229 units/period. Planning horizon: must cover L+1 = 5 periods (current + 4 future) => demand need \u2248 5 * 229 = 1,145 units. Inventory position: on-hand 197 + in-transit 814 = 1,011 units; shortfall \u2248 134 units. Risk: avoid large excess because holding cost = $1/unit/period reduces reward; small buffer prudent for week-to-week variation and holiday noise. Order decision: order 150 units to cover expected shortfall plus small safety buffer.",

Lead time: confirmed as 4 periods from history (arrivals consistently show 4-period lag). Inventory/pipeline: on-hand=238, in-transit=692 \u2192 pipeline total=930 units. Decision logic: use coverage of L+1=5 periods. Conservative demand forecast = 240 units/period \u2192 target pipeline = 240\xd75 = 1,200 units. Order = target \u2212 current pipeline = 1,200 \u2212 930 = 270 units. This balances service level for the holiday week against $1/unit holding cost.",

{
  "rationale": "World/calendar: Period 47 is 2019-12-30 (post-Christmas, New Year period) \u2014 no strong ongoing seasonal spike expected for basic womens trainer socks. Lead time: confirmed as 4 periods from history (consistent arrivals P1->P5, etc.). Demand forecast: use recent history (Periods 39\u201346) average \u2248233 units/period; this is consistent with the carry-over regimes (recent regime ~240\u2013310 but trending toward mid-200s).
