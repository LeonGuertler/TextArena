Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. SKU 372860001: on-hand=0, in-transit=0, recent demand samples [231,255,302,272,272] mean=266.4. No concluded arrivals to suggest lead-time deviation or lost shipments. Use promised lead time and population-based forecasts: default L to rely on promised 2-period lead time; default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service vs holding given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 (2019-02-18). SKU 372860001: on-hand=0, in-transit=310 (ordered in Period 1). Period 1 conclude shows arrived=0 for that order so no concluded lead-time observations exist \u2014 cannot infer actual lead time yet. Historical demand samples = [231,255,302,272,272]; use default methods to let the OR engine apply (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std with promised lead time to cover the review+lead horizon. This is conservative given the outstanding in-transit shipment; monitor future conclude messages for lead-time changes or lost shipment signals and adjust if arrivals fail to appear.

Carry-over insight: Delayed shipment: order=310 placed in Period 1 has not concluded (arrived=0); treat as in-transit and monitor for loss.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019-02-25). Recent demand history: [231,255,302,272,272] with a large spike (548) realized in Period 2 after arrival. On-hand=0, in-transit=311 (includes the order placed in Period 2). Observed lead times: one concluded shipment (order placed P1 arrived in P2 => lead_time=1). Promised L=2 but evidence supports shorter realized lead time; use calculate to set L based on observed lead times. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, giving a conservative forecast that accounts for the inferred lead time while letting OR engine apply service-level math. This balances service (capture high recent demand) against holding cost given limited on-hand inventory and in-transit units.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent demand has spiked (concluded demands: P1=287, P2=548, P3=399). On-hand=0, in-transit=374 (order placed in Period 3). Observed lead times from concludes: orders from P1->P2 and P2->P3 both had lead_time=1, so actual lead time appears to be 1 period (shorter than promised 2). To cover the recent elevated demand while limiting holding costs, I set L to be the calculated average of observed lead times (captures the persistent L=1 signal). For demand forecasting I use a recent_N estimate (N=3) to weight the last three realized demands (captures the recent upward regime). I apply recent_N for sigma_hat as well to reflect recent volatility. These choices make the OR backend build base stock for (1+L) periods using the recent mean and volatility, improving service during the demand surge while avoiding excessive inventory if the surge subsides.

Carry-over insight: Observed actual lead time = 1 period (Period 2 and Period 3 conclude messages both show lead_time=1 for orders placed in Periods 1 and 2).

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/11. Historical demand mean=266.4 (samples [231,255,302,272,272]). Concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 1 period for two observed orders (orders placed Periods 1\u21922 and 2\u21923). Recent orders (including Period 3 and 4) have not concluded and may be delayed/lost, but only two concluded lead-time observations exist. Choose L by averaging observed lead times to reflect realized 1-period flow. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat to let backend scale demand to (1+L) periods and adjust volatility; this avoids overfitting to the small sample and keeps safety stock calculation stable while monitoring in-transit backlog (903 units) for potential lost shipments.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/18. Demand history [231,255,302,272,272], on-hand=122, in-transit=529. Lead-time observations: orders placed P1->arrived P2 (LT=1), P2->P3 (LT=1), P3->P5 (LT=2); one P4 order remains unarrived (in-transit). Mixed/lengthening lead times and an overdue shipment motivate using observed average LT rather than promised. Set L=calculate to let backend average observed lead times; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample, giving a conservative replenishment covering review+lead demand while letting OR engine apply service-level tradeoff.

Carry-over insight: New: Lead time has become variable with recent observed values 1,1,2 (orders from P1,P2,P3); one P4 shipment remains unarrived \u2014 infer increased lead-time variability and potential delays.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). On-hand=0, in-transit=568. Observed concluded lead_times = [1,1,2] (variable, recent increase to 2) and several overdue/no-arrival events (P4 order still unarrived). To account for increased lead-time variability I use a recent average of observed lead times (N=3). Demand has shifted upward and is volatile over the last 5 periods (demands P2\u2013P6 = 548,399,338,252,329); I use recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets (1+L)-period demand and reflects recent variability. These settings raise target base-stock to protect service given uncertain/lengthened lead times while sigma_hat recent_N captures increased demand dispersion.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. On-hand=0, in-transit=814. Recent concluded lead times = [1,1,2] (orders from P1,P2,P3) and several recent non-arrivals (P4,P6,P7) indicate increased lead-time variability and possible losses. I set L to recent_N (N=3) to capture the short-run increased lead-time mean. Demand shows an upward regime versus the small-sample historical baseline; use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to bias the forecast toward recent demand levels while keeping variance estimated from full history. sigma_hat left as default to let backend scale variability with (1+L). These choices raise target base-stock to protect service against variable/longer lead times and in-transit uncertainty while using full-history volatility to avoid over-reacting to single spikes.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). On-hand=0, in-transit=529 (includes the P4 order of 529 still unarrived). Historical observed lead_times (from conclude messages): 1,1,2,2,1 \u2192 recent variability and mean >1. I set L to recent_N (N=5) to capture this higher, variable lead time (avg\u22481.4). Demand history is limited but stable; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over all samples, aligning safety stock to the inferred longer/more variable lead time while keeping demand estimate conservative. This addresses missing/late shipments by increasing protection through a longer effective lead time.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time variability increased; recent observed lead_times = 1,1,2,2,1 (avg ~1.4). Period 4 order (529) remains unarrived \u2014 monitor for potential lost shipment.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). Recent demand has been elevated vs earlier periods (last 5 demands: 252,329,415,382,322; mean=340). Lead time has been variable recently with observed lead_times = [1,1,2,2,1] (avg ~1.4) and one earlier order (Period 4) remains unarrived\u2014treat lead time as shorter-than-promised on average but variable. To balance higher recent demand and lead-time variability, set L to the recent average (recent_N) to reflect empirical lead-time behavior; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to anchor forecast and uncertainty on the most relevant regime. This increases target base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of the elevated recent demand while reflecting current volatility, improving service at moderate holding cost given profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

On-hand=0, in-transit=719 (several outstanding shipments, including an older unarrived order). To reflect higher recent demand and shorter/variable lead-time, set L as recent_N over last 5 observed lead times; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent 5 demand samples to capture the uptick and volatility. This increases target base-stock to improve service while sigma_hat recent_N preserves observed variability for safety stock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $368.00

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). Recent concluded lead_times = [1,1,2,2,1,2] (avg ~1.5) and variability has increased; one earlier order (Period 4) remains unarrived and some shipments showed 2-period delays. Demand history (samples used by backend): [231,255,302,272,272]. To reflect observed lead-time regime without overfitting short noise, set L to be calculated from observed lead times so the backend uses the empirical average. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, giving safety-cover for the longer/more variable lead times while avoiding aggressive manual overrides. This balances service level (by increasing lead-time coverage) against holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

Carry-over insight: Lead time regime changed: recent observed lead_times = 1,1,2,2,1,2 (avg ~1.5); increased lead-time variability and at least one long-delayed/unarrived shipment \u2014 monitor for lost shipment.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). On-hand=0, in-transit=718. Historical observed lead_times from conclude messages = [1,1,2,2,1,2] (avg ~1.5) and at least one earlier order remains unarrived, indicating increased lead-time and variability. To reflect the recent lead-time regime I set L using recent_N over the last 6 observed lead_time samples. Demand history (seed samples and recent high weekly demands) is unchanged enough to let backend compute mu_hat and sigma_hat using defaults ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples), which will scale safety stock with the inferred longer lead time. This balances higher service level (covering longer/more variable lead time) against holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime changed: recent observed lead_times = [1,1,2,2,1,2] (avg ~1.5); increased lead-time variability and at least one long-delayed/unarrived shipment \u2014 monitor for potential lost shipment.

Recent concluded lead_times show variability (most recent observed sequence ~[1,1,2,2,1,2], avg~1.5) and at least one long-unarrived shipment; use a recent-average L to reflect increased variability. In-transit (731) exceeds (1+L)*mean demand (approx (1+1.5)*266.4 = 666), so pipeline currently sufficient for target coverage. Choices: L via recent_N (N=6) to capture new regime avg ~1.5; mu_hat and sigma_hat use default so backend scales demand stats by (1+L) and computes safety stock with profit/holding tradeoff. This balances service (accounting for longer/variable lead times) while avoiding excessive extra explicit stocking given large existing in-transit.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20 (Period 15). On-hand=0, in-transit=560. History shows variable actual lead times with recent observed values [1,1,2,2,1,2] (avg ~1.5) and at least one long-delayed/unarrived shipment; pipeline is large but uncertain. I set L.method=calculate to let backend use the average of observed lead times (captures recent ~1.5 regime). Demand has increased and been volatile in recent periods; I use recent_N N=5 for mu_hat to focus the forecast on the latest demand (periods 10-14 average ~343) and default sigma_hat to let backend scale variability by sqrt(1+L). This balances service (longer/variable lead time) against holding cost given large in-transit but uncertain arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime: recent observed lead_times = [1,1,2,2,1,2] (avg ~1.5); increased lead-time variability and at least one long-delayed/unarrived shipment \u2014 monitor for potential lost shipment.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). On-hand=0, in-transit=737; recent concluded lead_times = [1,1,2,2,1,2] (avg ~1.5) and there are long-delayed/unarrived shipments (monitor for loss). Demand history is low-to-mid 300s; holding cost = $1, profit = $2 so service target is moderate. I set L to recent_N (N=6) to capture the shifted, variable lead-time regime rather than blindly using promised 2. mu_hat and sigma_hat use default calculations so the OR engine applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over all demand samples; this leverages full demand history while the adjusted L inflates the review+lead demand and safety stock to cover observed lead-time variability and current large in-transit position.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019/6/3. Observed lead times in concluded history are variable (recent observed lead_times \u2248 1.7 avg) and at least one long-unarrived shipment (order from Period 4) remains a risk. Demand has risen recently; using a recent-window demand estimate (last 5 periods) captures current regime while L is set from observed lead-time average to reflect variability. This increases pipeline coverage to reduce stockouts given in-transit=737 and zero on-hand while limiting excess holding by using recent demand volatility for sigma.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime shifted to higher variability: recent observed lead_times average ~1.7 (values include multiple 2-period observations); at least one long-delayed/unarrived shipment (Period 4 order=529) \u2014 monitor for loss.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/10 (Period 18). On-hand=0, in-transit=737. Historical concluded lead_times show increased variability and a higher recent average (~1.7); at least one long-delayed/unarrived shipment (Period 4 order) may be lost. To reflect the shorter-but-variable observed lead times I set L using recent observed lead_times (recent_N=6) to capture the elevated average. Demand has remained high in recent periods (last 5 demands mean ~311 units); use recent demand (recent_N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR base-stock covers (1+L) periods using the most relevant data. This balances higher service needs against holding cost while acknowledging in-transit stock may include delayed/lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime: recent observed lead_times average increased (~1.5-1.7) with higher variability; at least one long-delayed/unarrived shipment (Period 4 order=529) \u2014 monitor for potential loss.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). On-hand=0, in-transit=737. Historical concluded lead_times (per arrivals): [1,1,2,2,1,2,2] (avg ~1.57) indicating a persistent increase and variability vs promised L=2. Recent demand has increased: last 5 realized demands (Periods 14-18) = [275,348,370,297,294], mean \u2248316.8. I set L to recent_N (N=7) to capture the most recent observed lead-time regime (avg \u22481.57) so the OR engine uses a data-driven lead-time estimate rather than blindly trusting promised L. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N with N=5 to capture the recent higher demand level and its volatility (use last 5 demand samples). These choices raise target base-stock to reduce stockouts given higher realized demand and variable lead times while keeping sigma based on recent volatility so the cap limits extreme over-ordering.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime shifted to higher variability; recent observed lead_times = [1,1,2,2,1,2,2] (avg ~1.57) and at least one long-delayed/unarrived shipment persists; recent demand elevated (Periods 14-18 mean \u2248316.8) \u2014 plan for higher stock.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24 (Period 20). Recent concluded history shows lead-time volatility rising with recent observed lead_times \u2248 [1,1,2,2,1,2,2] (avg ~1.57) and recent demand elevated (Periods 15-19 mean \u2248328.6). On-hand=0, in-transit=737 \u2014 pipeline large but includes long-delayed/unconcluded shipments; continue to size safety stock upward to cover variable lead time and elevated recent demand. Chosen L: use recent lead-time average (capture increased mean and variability). Chosen mu_hat and sigma_hat: use recent 5-period demand to reflect the recent higher-demand regime and its volatility so backend base-stock raises orders without overreacting to older low periods.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime has shifted to higher mean and variability (recent observed lead_times ~[1,1,2,2,1,2,2], avg ~1.57); recent demand elevated (Periods 15-19 mean \u2248328.6). Monitor long-delayed/unarrived shipments for potential loss.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-01 P21. On-hand=0, in-transit=737. Recent concludes show variable lead-times with more 2-period observations and at least one very delayed/unarrived shipment (Period 4 order); recent observed lead_time avg \u22481.5\u20131.7. Demand has been elevated in recent periods (Periods 15\u201319 mean \u2248329). To guard against lost/delayed shipments and higher demand, I increase the lead-time estimate using recent observations and base demand forecasts on the most recent 5 periods to capture the elevated regime while keeping volatility estimated from the same window.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime shifted upward and more variable (recent observed lead_times avg \u22481.5\u20131.7) with at least one long-delayed/unarrived shipment; recent demand elevated (Periods 15\u201319 mean \u2248328.6).

Historical concluded lead_times show higher mean/variability (~1.5); recent demand (Periods 15-21) elevated ~290\u2013370 with last 5 demands = [348,370,297,294,334,289,317] (use most recent regime). To capture the observed lead-time regime shift, set L by averaging observed lead times (method=calculate). To reflect elevated recent demand and reduce stockouts, forecast mu_hat using the recent demand regime (recent_N, N=5). Use recent_N for sigma_hat (N=5) to capture recent volatility. These choices increase target base-stock to better cover the longer/more variable lead time and higher recent demand while letting the OR backend apply the profit/holding tradeoff.

Recent history shows elevated demand in Periods 15\u201321 (~290\u2013370, recent mean ~317\u2013335) and a higher, variable lead-time regime with multiple 2-period observations (recent avg ~1.5\u20131.7). Several earlier shipments remain unarrived and may be lost, so assume a longer/more variable lead time. I set L using recent_N=7 to capture the most recent lead-time variability. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to reflect the elevated recent demand regime and increased demand volatility so the backend raises the base stock while acknowledging variable lead time and existing in-transit stock.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22). On-hand=0, in-transit=737. Historical demand samples = [231,255,302,272,272] seed but recent realized demands (P19-23) are higher (334,289,317,313,352; recent mean \u2248321). Lead times observed in concluded history vary (mix of 1 and 2); recent regime shows increased mean/variability. Given elevated recent demand and variable lead time, I select an L estimate based on all observed lead times to let backend infer average variability, and use recent demand (last 5 periods) to scale mu_hat and sigma_hat so the base-stock targets cover the higher recent demand. Keeping pipeline/in-transit (737) in mind, this raises forecasted (1+L) demand while recognizing many prior orders have been long-delayed \u2014 monitor for lost shipments but do not assume immediate loss here.

Carry-over insight: Recent demand elevated: periods 19-23 mean \u2248321 (vs earlier samples ~266); lead-time regime remains more variable (mix of 1\u20132 periods) and at least one long-delayed/unarrived shipment persists; plan for higher stock coverage.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29 (Period 25). Recent demand elevated (Periods 19-23 mean \u2248321) and historical lead times have shifted to a mixed 1\u20132 regime (recent avg \u22481.5\u20131.7) with at least one long-unarrived shipment (Period 4 order) \u2014 raises required pipeline coverage. I set L using a recent-window average to capture the higher, variable lead time. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat from recent demand (last 5 periods) to reflect the elevated demand regime and recent volatility so the OR backend raises base-stock and caps appropriately to improve service while recognizing holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime elevated and more variable (recent observed lead_times avg \u22481.5\u20131.7 with mix of 1\u20132); at least one long-delayed/unarrived shipment (Period 4 order) persists; recent demand elevated (Periods 19\u201323 mean \u2248321).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). Recent history shows lead times variable (mix of 1 and 2 periods; recent observed avg ~1.5) and at least one long-unarrived shipment \u2014 treat lead time as elevated and variable. Demand has been elevated recently (Periods 19\u201323 mean \u2248321) vs earlier samples. To cover the higher recent demand and increased lead-time variability, I use a recent-window estimate for L to capture the current lead-time regime, and recent-window estimates for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the elevated mean and current volatility. This increases base-stock to improve service given profit/holding tradeoff while avoiding overcommitment to old lower-demand regimes.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=0, in-transit=737 \u2014 sizable pipeline but several past shipments showed variable/extended lead times and at least one long-unarrived order; recent demand elevated (Periods 19\u201323 mean \u2248321). I cannot rely on promised L=2 alone, so ask backend to compute observed average lead time from concluded history (method=calculate). For demand I bias toward recent elevated demand using recent_N (N=5) to cover (1+L) review+lead period demand; likewise use recent_N (N=5) for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These choices increase target base-stock to protect service against higher recent demand and lead-time variability while keeping volatility estimated from recent samples.

Carry-over insight: Recent demand elevated (Periods 19\u201323 mean \u2248321) and lead-time regime more variable (mix of 1\u20132 periods, recent average ~1.5\u20131.7); at least one long-delayed/unarrived shipment persists\u2014monitor for potential loss.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=0, in-transit=737. Historical concluded lead_times show recent variability with multiple 1\u20132 period observations (avg ~1.5\u20131.6). Recent demand has been elevated but the last five periods show a somewhat lower mean (~289). To cover the variable lead-time regime while responding to recent demand, set lead time estimate using recent lead-time observations (N=7) and set demand and volatility using the most recent 5 demand samples. These choices increase pipeline coverage for the higher/variable lead time while keeping demand forecast responsive to the latest data and limiting excess holding cost.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Recent history shows higher and more variable lead times (mix of 1\u20132, recent average ~1.5\u20131.7) and sustained elevated demand vs the original sample. On-hand=0, in-transit=737 (covers multiple periods but one long-delayed/unarrived shipment persists). To account for shorter-term lead-time trend use recent_N for L (capture latest variability). For demand forecast use recent_N over a moderately-sized window to reflect elevated recent demand while smoothing noise. Keep sigma_hat default so backend uses full-sample volatility scaled for (1+L). These settings raise base stock to improve service under variable lead times while letting OR backend cap orders to limit exposure to holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime elevated and more variable (mix of 1\u20132 periods, recent avg ~1.5\u20131.7); at least one long-delayed/unarrived shipment persists\u2014monitor for potential loss.

To guard against variable lead time and elevated demand while limiting excess holding cost, I set L to a recent average (captures increased volatility), use a recent demand mean for mu_hat to reflect the latest demand regime, and use a recent demand std for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility.

On-hand=0, in-transit=737 (covers multiple periods). Because lead time regime has clearly shifted upward and become more variable, I set L via recent_N to capture the empirical average of the last 7 observed lead times. I leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as default (use all historical demand samples) to avoid overfitting to short-term noise given limited sample size; this gives the OR backend a stable demand estimate while the adjusted L increases required pipeline coverage to guard against stockouts given higher lead-time variability.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-16 (Period 32). On-hand=0, in-transit=737. Historical concluded lead_times show mixed 1\u20132 periods with recent average >1.5; several long-delayed/unarrived shipments remain. Recent demand has softened over the last 5 periods. To balance service vs holding cost: increase L to reflect observed variable/longer lead time, use a short recent demand window to adapt to the recent downward shift, and keep sigma based on full history to avoid overreacting to noise.

Carry-over insight: Recent demand moderated: Periods 27\u201331 mean = 270.4 (301,294,229,274,254) vs earlier elevated mean ~321 \u2014 reduce demand forecast window accordingly.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-23 (Period 33). On-hand=0, in-transit=737. Historical concludes show mixed lead_times (1 and 2); observed lead_times average \u22481.6 (multiple 1s and 2s) and at least one long-delayed/unarrived shipment persists. Demand in recent periods (27\u201331) moderated to mean \u2248270.4. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses observed lead-time average. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N with N=5 to anchor forecasts to the most recent demand regime (periods 27\u201331) and capture current moderated mean/volatility; this balances higher in-transit coverage against holding cost while reacting to the more-stable recent demand profile.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime elevated and variable (mix of 1\u20132 periods), recent observed lead_time average \u22481.6; at least one long-delayed/unarrived shipment persists (Period 4 order). Recent demand moderated: periods 27\u201331 mean = 270.4.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-30 (Period 34). On-hand=0, in-transit=737. Historical conclude messages show variable actual lead-times (mix of 1\u20132, recent average ~1.5\u20131.7) and at least one long-delayed/unarrived shipment; recent demand regime moderated vs prior elevated periods but a spike at Period 33 (405) increases short-run uncertainty. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the observed lead-time history to reflect the recent 1\u20132 period mix rather than the promised 2. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to focus the forecast on the most recent regime (Periods 29\u201333) which captures the recent moderation plus the Period 33 spike; sigma_hat also uses recent_N (N=5) to capture recent volatility. These choices increase responsiveness to recent demand and lead-time variability while the large in-transit position (737) will be reconciled by the OR engine when computing orders.

Date 2019/10/7 (Period 35). Recent demand has moderated versus earlier elevated levels: periods 27\u201331 mean \u2248270.4 (301,294,229,274,254). In-transit = 737 and on-hand = 0; there is at least one long-delayed/unconcluded shipment in history. Observed lead_times in concluded arrivals are mixed (1s and 2s) with recent average \u22481.6, so I use a recent-window estimate for L. For demand I use a recent 5-period window (periods 27\u201331) to capture the moderated regime. I also use a recent-5 window for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These settings raise forecasted coverage for the slightly-elevated/variable lead-time regime while avoiding overweighting older elevated demand samples.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime elevated and variable (mix of 1\u20132 periods), recent observed lead_time average \u22481.6; at least one long-delayed/unarrived shipment persists. Recent demand moderated: periods 27\u201331 mean = 270.4.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). On-hand=0, in-transit=737; profit=2, holding=1. Historical concludes show elevated, variable lead-times (mix of 1\u20132 periods) and at least one long-unarrived shipment; recent demand has moderated vs earlier elevated levels. To capture lead-time variability I let backend compute average observed lead time (calculate). For demand I use a recent window to reflect the moderated recent regime: recent_N with N=5 (last 5 demand samples). For volatility I also use recent_N N=5 to reflect recent demand variability. These settings increase responsiveness to the recent demand regime while letting L reflect measured lead-time variability and monitor in-transit exposures.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime elevated and variable (mix of 1\u20132 periods), recent observed lead_time average \u22481.5\u20131.7; at least one long-delayed/unarrived shipment persists. Recent demand moderated (Periods 31\u201335 mean \u2248  , use recent window going forward).

History shows variable actual lead times (mix of 1\u20132 periods) and at least one long-unarrived shipment; recent demand has moderated vs prior elevated window. To be robust to observed lead-time variability and potential lost shipments, I let the backend compute an average observed lead time from concluded arrivals (method=calculate) and use default demand/volatility aggregation so the OR engine uses full-sample mean/SD scaled by (1+L). This keeps forecasts conservative while letting the OR optimizer set service-level-aware base stock.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). On-hand=0, in-transit=737. Historical concluded lead_times show a stable mix of 1 and 2 periods (recent average \u22481.5\u20131.7) so actual lead time is lower than promised=2 but variable. Recent demand has moderated vs earlier elevated levels; last 5 observed demands (Periods 33\u201337) average \u2248306. To cover review+lead demand while reflecting recent regime, I set L by averaging the most recent observed lead times (recent_N) and base demand estimates on the most recent 5 demand samples (recent_N) with matching recent volatility for sigma_hat. These choices raise service coverage for the now-higher variable lead time while avoiding overreaction to older data. They also account for the large in-transit volume (737) when the OR engine computes pipeline; monitor long-delayed/unarrived shipments separately.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/4 (Period 39). On-hand=0, in-transit=737; history shows persistent lead-time variability and at least one long-delayed/unarrived shipment (Period 4). Recent demand has moderated (Periods 31\u201335 mean \u2248270). To account for observed variable lead-times I ask backend to infer L from concluded lead-times (calculate). Forecast demand using a recent window to reflect the moderated recent mean (recent_N, N=5). Volatility also set from the same recent window (recent_N, N=5). These choices raise safety against longer/variable lead times while keeping mu_hat tied to the latest demand regime to avoid excess holding costs given holding=$1 and profit=$2.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:

Observed lead-times have been variable (mix of 1\u20132) with recent average \u22481.6; multiple delayed/unarrived shipments merit using recent observed lead-times rather than promised=2. I set L via recent_N (N=7) to capture recent lead-time regime (7 observed lead-time samples). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat via recent_N (N=5) to focus the demand forecast and volatility on the latest moderated demand window, helping the OR backend size base-stock to cover (1+L) periods under current variability while avoiding excess holding given holding cost=$1 and profit=$2.

Recent demand has moderated vs earlier elevated window; using recent_N=5 for mu_hat captures the latest demand level (last 5 periods) so the (1+L)*mean uses current regime. Use recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to estimate volatility from the same recent window. These choices increase coverage for longer/variable lead times while keeping forecasts tied to the most recent demand pattern.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25. On-hand=0, in-transit=737. Historical concluded lead-times show a shift from 1\u2192mix of 1\u20132 (avg ~1.5\u20131.7) and at least one long-unarrived shipment (Period 4 order); demand samples show elevated/moderated recent levels vs the original seed. To reflect observed lead-time regime change I ask backend to compute the average observed lead time (calculate) so ordering accounts for realized variability. Use default demand/statistics (backend (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std over samples) to keep forecasts anchored to historical data while letting L absorb the measured lead-time increase; this balances higher service coverage against holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime elevated and more variable (mix of 1\u20132 periods, recent observed average ~1.5\u20131.7); at least one long-delayed/unarrived shipment (Period 4 order) persists \u2014 monitor for potential loss.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/2 (Period 43). On-hand=0, in-transit=737. Historical concluded lead_times show a recent regime of mixed 1\u20132 periods (avg \u22481.5\u20131.7) and at least one long-delayed/unarrived shipment (Period 4 order). Demand has moderated vs earlier elevated weeks; last 5 concluded demands (Periods 38\u201342) average ~266.6. To cover the more-variable, slightly-higher lead-time regime I set L using a recent-window average of observed lead times. For demand I use a recent 5-period window to reflect the moderated recent demand. Volatility (sigma_hat) also uses the same recent window so safety stock reflects recent variability. These choices increase cover for variable lead time while avoiding overstocking from older elevated demand periods.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime remains elevated and variable (mix of 1\u20132 periods, recent observed average \u22481.6); at least one long-delayed/unarrived shipment (Period 4 order) persists \u2014 monitor for potential loss.

Recent demand has moderated vs prior elevated window; use a short recent window to capture the current lower mean.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/30 (Period 47). On-hand=0, in-transit=737. Historical concluded lead-times show a sustained, elevated/variable regime (~mix of 1\u20132 periods, recent average ~1.5\u20131.7) so using a recent average is appropriate. Recent demand has moderated versus earlier elevated windows; use a short recent window (N=5) for mu_hat to capture current lower demand. sigma_hat left as default to reflect full-sample volatility scaled by (1+L). These choices increase responsiveness to the current demand level while accounting for higher/variable lead time and existing in-transit stock (737) to avoid over-ordering.
