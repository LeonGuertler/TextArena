Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. SKU 372860001 (women's socks) with steady historical demands [231,255,302,272,272] and no on-hand or in-transit inventory; promised lead time = 4. No concluded arrivals yet so no evidence of lost or changed lead time. Use default lead time and default demand moments (use full-sample mean/std scaled by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L)) to let the OR engine compute a base-stock balancing profit ($2) vs holding cost ($1). This is conservative given no recent regime change or calendar signal.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (period 2). SKU 372860001: start on-hand=0, in-transit=310 (ordered in Period 1). Historical demands = [231,255,302,272,272] (mean=266.4). Period 1 conclude shows arrived=0 for the Period 1 order \u2014 no concluded arrivals yet, so actual lead time is not observable. Promised lead time=4 remains the best prior. Use default lead time so OR backend uses promised L. Demand appears stable around mean\u2248266; no strong changepoint evidence or seasonal signal for this short horizon, so use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This keeps the base-stock anchored to historical demand while the pipeline (310 units) is monitored for overdue/lost shipment if it fails to conclude in subsequent periods.

Carry-over insight: In-transit 310 units from Period 1 not yet concluded (Period 1 conclude: arrived=0) \u2014 possible delayed or lost shipment; monitor for missing conclude in future periods.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. On-hand=0, in-transit=621 (310 from P1, 311 from P2) with both prior orders not concluded -> likely lead-time longer than promised or lost shipments. Demand history stable recent mean ~266.4 (samples [231,255,302,272,272]). To avoid stockouts given missing arrivals, I explicitly increase lead time estimate so the OR backend inflates (1+L) safety stock rather than under-order. I keep demand and volatility estimation as default (use full sample mean/std scaled by (1+L)) because no clear demand regime change is evident.

Carry-over insight: Period 2: In-transit 310 units from Period 1 not yet concluded (Period 1 conclude: arrived=0) \u2014 possible delayed or lost shipment; monitor for missing conclude in future periods.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-03-04. All three prior orders (310, 311, 487 = 1108 in-transit) have not concluded; no positive arrivals observed \u2014 strong signal of delayed or lost shipments. To protect service during this disruption I assume a longer effective lead time than promised. I set L explicit=6 to expand coverage for delayed arrivals. Recent demand has spiked (last 3 observed demands: 287, 548, 399) vs. older baseline; I use recent_N N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets inventory to cover the elevated short-term demand (higher base-stock) while sigma reflects recent volatility. This balances a higher service level now (avoid stockouts given in-transit uncertainty) against holding cost by using only short-run demand evidence rather than the full historical mean.

Carry-over insight: Delayed/lost shipments: orders from Periods 1-3 (310,311,487) remain unconcluded (1108 in-transit); treat as delayed or possibly lost until concludes appear.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). Demand history stable (past samples: [231,255,302,272,272], mean\u2248266.4). All prior orders (Periods 1\u20134: 310+311+487+627=1735) remain in-transit with no concludes \u2014 possible lost/delayed shipments, but per rules we must only infer lead time from concluded messages. Therefore keep L as promised (default). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level vs holding cost conservatively given high uncertainty about arrivals. On-hand=0 and large in-transit flagged; monitor for concluded arrivals before changing lead-time estimate.

Carry-over insight: Delayed/lost shipments persist: orders from Periods 1\u20134 (310,311,487,627) remain unconcluded (1735 in-transit); treat as delayed/possibly lost until concludes appear.

Daily Profit: $504.00, Daily Holding Cost: $58.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $446.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent concluded message shows Period 5 arrival: 310 units (ordered Period 1, lead_time=4) \u2014 actual lead time observed = 4 matching promised L. Several subsequent orders (Periods 2\u20134) remain unconcluded but one clear observation supports using the promised lead time. Recent demand has been elevated and volatile (Period1\u20135 demands = [287,548,399,338,252], mean \u2248 365) so I bias forecasts to the recent regime. Choose L=default to trust the promised 4-period lead time (confirmed by the Period 5 conclude). Use mu_hat recent_N with N=5 to scale to the recent higher demand regime ((1+L)\xd7recent mean). Use sigma_hat recent_N with N=5 to capture observed high variance in the same recent window. This increases target base-stock to protect service level given high profit vs holding cost, while sigma estimate raises safety stock to cover volatility; using recent_N avoids diluting the forecast with older lower-demand samples.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time confirmed = 4 periods (Period 5 conclude: arrived 310 from Period 1, lead_time=4); treat outstanding orders from Periods 2\u20134 as delayed but not yet lost until/if they never conclude.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-03-25. Recent concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 (Period 5 conclude: arrived 310 from Period 1, lead_time=4; Period 6 conclude: arrived 311 from Period 2, lead_time=4). On-hand=40, in-transit=1568 (large pipeline); no urgent reorder required. Use lead-time inference (average observed) to reflect confirmed L=4, and use default demand/volatility (all-sample mean/std scaled by (1+L)) so the OR backend computes base_stock from historical demand without overreacting to short-term noise. This balances service level (large pipeline + confirmed L) against holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time confirmed = 4 periods based on: Period 5 conclude: arrived 310 (ordered Period 1, lead_time=4); Period 6 conclude: arrived 311 (ordered Period 2, lead_time=4).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Recent concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 (Period 5: arrived 310 from P1, lead_time=4; Period 6: arrived 311 from P2; Period 7: arrived 487 from P3). On-hand=112, in-transit=1144 (large pipeline). Use default lead time (promised=4) since actual = promised and recent concludes support L=4. Demand history samples [231,255,302,272,272] show stable mean; no clear recent demand regime shift and no calendar spike through early April for basic socks. To keep OR backend aligned with observed lead time and stable demand, set mu_hat and sigma_hat to default ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the engine computes base-stock using full-sample stats. This avoids overreacting to pipeline noise and balances service level vs holding cost given high in-transit stock.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/8. Recent confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple concluded arrivals show lead_time=4). Current inventory: on-hand=357, in-transit=974 (some in-transit from recent weeks). Recent demand has shifted higher vs. older samples \u2014 last 8 observed period demands = [287,548,399,338,252,329,415,382]; detect a sustained higher-demand regime across these 8 periods, so I use recent_N=8 to capture the new mean and volatility. L set to calculated (avg observed lead times = 4) so mu_hat = (1+L)*recent mean captures demand over review+lead; sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*recent std captures current variability. These parameters raise the base stock to meet the higher recent demand while the cap in the OR engine limits extreme orders, balancing service level (profit=$2 > holding=$1) against holding costs.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-04-15 (Period 10). Recent concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (Period 5 arrived 310 from P1, Period 6 arrived 311 from P2, Period 7 arrived 487 from P3, Period 8 arrived 627 from P4). On-hand=35, in-transit=1493 (large pipeline). Recent demand has been elevated and variable; I use the most recent demand regime (Periods 5\u20139: 252,329,415,382,322) to set forecast and volatility so the OR backend stocks for the current high-demand regime across the review+lead horizon (1+L periods) and avoids understocking given confirmed L=4 while controlling holding cost via capped ordering.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time confirmed = 4 periods (evidence: Period 5 conclude arrived 310 ordered P1, Period 6 arrived 311 ordered P2, Period 7 arrived 487 ordered P3, Period 8 arrived 627 ordered P4); large pipeline in-transit ~1493 units.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22 (Period 11). Recent concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods. On-hand=181, in-transit=1272 \u2014 large pipeline; arrivals recently matched orders with 4-period lag. Demand has stepped up versus older baseline: recent period demands (Periods 5\u201310) = [252,329,415,382,322,308], indicating a higher mean and elevated volatility. To capture the new demand regime, set lead time by calculation from observed lead times, and use recent_N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend base-stock reflects the recent higher mean and variability while leveraging the confirmed LT=4. This balances service (avoid stockouts given high pipeline/demand) versus holding cost by letting the OR engine compute safety stock from recent mean/variance.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). Recent concluded history consistently shows actual lead time = 4 periods (arrivals: P5 from P1, P6 from P2, P7 from P3, P8 from P4, P10 from P6, P11 from P7). On-hand = 0, in-transit = 1485 (large pipeline). Several earlier delayed arrivals have since concluded, confirming L=4. I choose to let the OR engine compute L from observed lead-times (method: calculate) to reflect confirmed behavior. Demand seed given (historical samples) is limited and no strong calendar shock is present; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend uses all samples scaled by (1+L). This keeps forecasting anchored to full history while OR applies its capped ordering to limit excessive short-term orders given high in-transit. This balances service (use observed L and full-sample mean) against holding cost given large pipeline.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). Recent conclude history consistently shows orders arriving with a 4-period lag (P5 arrived P1, P6 arrived P2, P7 arrived P3, P8 arrived P4, P10 arrived P6, P11 arrived P7, P12 arrived P8) and current on-hand=19 with in-transit=1292. No evidence of ongoing lost shipments; actual lead time = 4. Use lead-time estimate inferred from observed concludes (calculate). Demand forecasting: use default aggregation so backend computes (1+L)*mean of all seed samples to capture long-run average; volatility use default. This balances service (higher L recognized) while avoiding over-specifying mu/sigma given stable historical samples and large pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time confirmed = 4 periods (evidence: Period 5 arrived 310 ordered P1; P6 arrived 311 ordered P2; P7 arrived 487 ordered P3; P8 arrived 627 ordered P4; P10 arrived 454 ordered P6; P11 arrived 63 ordered P7; P12 arrived 457 ordered P8).

Historical demand samples (seed) show mean ~266 (samples [231,255,302,272,272]). Given confirmed LT=4, large pipeline, and no strong recent demand regime shift, use default methods so OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and volatility over full sample. This keeps service high (covering L+1 periods of demand) while letting the backend cap orders to limit excess inventory given holding cost $1 vs profit $2.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-05-20 (Period 15). Recent concluded history consistently shows actual lead time = 4 periods (arrivals from orders placed 4 periods earlier). Demand has risen versus the small-sample prior: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 10\u201314) = [308, 427, 438, 267, 275], mean=343. On-hand=229, in-transit=1256 (large pipeline). To reflect the confirmed L=4 and the recent higher-demand regime, use default promised lead time and set demand forecast and volatility from the most recent 5 periods so the OR engine builds a larger base-stock to protect service while the large pipeline buffers stockouts. This balances profit ($2) vs holding cost ($1) by targeting service for the current higher-demand regime while not overreacting to older low-demand samples.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:

Current inventory: on-hand 157, in-transit 1291 \u2014 large pipeline but recent arrivals confirm LT=4 and no systemic losses now. Demand history shows stable weekly demand in past periods.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-06-03 (Period 17). Demand context: recent realized weekly demands strong and variable; on-hand=51, in-transit=1323 (large pipeline). Multiple concluded arrivals consistently show orders placed arrive after 4 periods \u2014 actual lead time confirmed = 4. Several earlier delayed/no-arrival episodes have resolved, so use promised/confirmed lead time. Choose L: default (use promised 4). Choose mu_hat: default so backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) to reflect full review+lead demand from history. Choose sigma_hat: default so backend uses sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) to capture observed variability. These conservative defaults rely on confirmed L and historical demand variability to balance service (profit>holding) while capping orders via OR engine cap to limit excessive inventory given already-large pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time confirmed = 4 periods (evidence: Period 5 arrived 310 ordered P1; P6 arrived 311 ordered P2; P7 arrived 487 ordered P3; P8 arrived 627 ordered P4; P10 arrived 454 ordered P6; P11 arrived 63 ordered P7; P12 arrived 457 ordered P8; P13 arrived 519 ordered P9; P14 arrived 233 ordered P10; P15 arrived 276 ordered P11; P16 arrived 264 ordered P12).

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/15 P23. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods. Current on-hand=194, in-transit=1210 (large pipeline) while recent weekly demand averages ~309 (recent concludes). No clear demand regime shift or seasonal event in mid-July; shipments now reliably arrive with 4-period lead time. To let OR backend use promised/default statistics and avoid overreacting to pipeline, use default lead time and default demand moment estimates so base-stock uses full-sample mean/variance. This balances service (keeping pipeline covered) against holding cost given persistent large in-transit inventory.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22): demand has been stable with recent weekly demands in history; actual lead time consistently confirmed = 4 periods. Current inventory: on-hand=127, in-transit=1234 (large pipeline). Given confirmed LT=4 and ample pipeline, use promised/default lead time to match backend assumption. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from historical demand samples; this lets the OR engine balance service level against holding cost using the standard base-stock calculation while acknowledging the large in-transit stock.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29): on-hand=183, in-transit=1256. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods. Pipeline is large relative to on-hand but arrivals have been reliable with LT=4. Profit=$2, holding=$1 -> service quantile q = 2/(2+1)=0.667 so backend will target moderate safety stock. I choose default lead time to match promised/observed LT=4 and default demand moments so the OR engine uses full sample history to compute base_stock and cap. This keeps parameters simple, leverages confirmed LT=4, and lets the OR backend balance service level vs holding cost given current pipeline.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/12 (Period 27). Historical concludes repeatedly confirm actual lead time = 4 periods and pipeline remains large (in-transit 1175) while on-hand = 261. Recent demand samples [231,255,302,272,272] (mean \u2248 266.4) show stable weekly demand. No new calendar events requiring adjustment. Given confirmed LT=4 and stable demand, use default lead time (promised) and default demand/volatility aggregation so the OR backend computes base-stock from full-sample mean and std. This keeps orders aligned with observed 4-period replenishment cadence while avoiding aggressive up/down swings given a large pipeline.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19 (Period 28). On-hand=269, in-transit=1113. Historical conclude messages consistently map arrivals to orders placed 4 periods earlier \u2014 actual lead time = 4 confirmed across many periods. Demand history shows no recent structural break vs. the seed samples; pipeline is large but arriving reliably with L=4. To avoid overfitting noisy short-term swings and because actual lead time matches the promised L, use default lead time and default demand/volatility estimators so the OR backend applies its standard (1+L) scaling to the full-sample mean/std. This balances service level (use proven L=4) against holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time confirmed = 4 periods (multiple conclude messages mapping arrivals to orders placed 4 periods prior); large persistent in-transit pipeline (~1113) while on-hand is 269 \u2014 monitor but arrivals appear reliable.

LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14): demand context steady; historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods. On-hand=169 with large reliable in-transit ~1212 \u2014 arrivals have been regular at LT=4. Use promised/default lead time to align with observed LT. Keep mu_hat and sigma_hat at defaults so backend computes (1+L)\xd7sample mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from historical demand, balancing service level (profit>holding cost) without inflating safety stock given large pipeline.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21 (Period 37). Historical conclude messages consistently confirm actual lead time = 4 periods across many periods; current view shows on-hand=174 and a large reliable in-transit pipeline=1226. No recent demand regime shift or calendar event identified. Because lead time is stable and arrivals have been consistent, use the backend defaults so it leverages full historical demand statistics and the promised lead time. This keeps the OR engine's base-stock calculation aligned with long-run demand and the observed L=4 while avoiding overfitting to short-term noise in on-hand/pipeline fluctuations.

Demand samples (provided) are limited; no clear recent demand regime shift. To let OR backend use promised/confirmed lead time and stable historical demand stats, choose default methods so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility from all samples.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/4 (Period 39). Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods; pipeline reliable and large (In-transit=1106) while on-hand=248. Past demand samples (seeded) are limited but no strong recent regime change in demand observed. Given confirmed LT=4 and stable demand, use defaults so OR backend computes base_stock from full-sample mean/variance scaled by (1+L). This preserves service level while avoiding manual over/under-adjustment despite large pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time confirmed = 4 periods (conclude messages across periods map arrivals to orders placed 4 periods prior). Persistent large in-transit pipeline (~1106) while on-hand=248 \u2014 monitor for imbalance.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). Observed reliable actual lead time = 4 periods (concludes through Period 39 consistently map arrivals to orders placed 4 periods earlier). On-hand=318, in-transit=1066 (large pipeline). Recent demand shows modest downward/upward noise but no regime shift (last 5 period demands: 266,240,306,276,241; mean\u2248265.8). To match observed lead time and recent demand, keep L = promised (default = 4), set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to bias the base stock toward current demand level across the review+lead window, and leave sigma_hat as default so backend uses full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances service (use recent demand signal) vs holding cost given large pipeline.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:

Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). Historical concludes consistently confirm actual lead time = 4 periods and arrivals mapping to orders placed 4 periods earlier. Current inventory: on-hand=325, in-transit=815. Demand history shows stable weekly demand with no new calendar shocks. Pipeline is large but reliable; no new lost-shipment signal. I therefore use default lead time and demand estimates so the OR backend uses full historical sample stats ((1+L) scaling) to compute base stock and cap. This balances service (use observed 4-period lead time and full-sample mean) against holding cost given current healthy on-hand + in-transit.

Current inventory: on-hand=346, in-transit=1001 \u2014 large pipeline but on-hand adequate relative to recent weekly demands. No clear recent demand regime shift in the conclude/demand history; use backend defaults so OR engine uses full sample statistics and the promised lead time to compute base stock and cap.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/2 (Period 43). Historical conclude messages consistently confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple period concludes map arrivals to orders placed 4 periods earlier). On-hand=297, in-transit=949 \u2014 large pipeline but arrivals have been reliable at L=4. Use promised/default lead time to align with observed behavior. Demand historical seed (provided samples) shows moderate, stable demand; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (no recent changepoint detected). This keeps base-stock anchored to long-run mean while OR backend's cap limits over-ordering given the large pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time confirmed = 4 periods (consistent concludes across periods); persistent large in-transit pipeline (~949 currently) while on-hand is moderate (297) \u2014 monitor but arrivals appear reliable.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:

Date 2019/12/9. Demand history shows stable weekly demand with recent moderate values; actual lead time has been consistently 4 periods per concluded history and current pipeline is large (in-transit=1037) while on-hand=425. No new evidence of lead-time shifts or demand regime change. Use promised/default lead time to align with reliable conclude history and keep mu_hat/sigma_hat as default so backend uses full-sample mean and variance scaled by (1+L). This avoids overreacting to recent low single-week demand and lets the OR engine cap orders using its cap logic against the large existing pipeline.

Date 2019/12/16. Lead time has been consistently confirmed = 4 periods across conclude history; pipeline is large (in-transit=1158) while on-hand=224. Demand history (seed samples) shows moderate variability. Given reliable 4-period lead time and no new regime detected in demand, use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes base-stock from full-sample mean/variance.
