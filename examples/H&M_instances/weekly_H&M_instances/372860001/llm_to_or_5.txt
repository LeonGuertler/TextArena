Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. SKU 372860001 (women's fine-knit trainer socks). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no overdue arrivals. Historical demands [231,255,302,272,272] show no clear changepoint; recent history consistent with mean ~266.4 and moderate variability. I use promised lead time (default L=0) and default demand estimates so the OR backend receives a stable base-stock anchored to the empirical mean and std. This balances service (covering current-period demand) against holding cost given modest volatility and no calendar shocks visible.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. SKU 372860001 (women's socks). Recent concluded arrival (Period 1) shows orders arriving with lead_time=0. On-hand=0, in-transit=0, prior period sold through a 278-unit receipt. Historical demand samples = [231,255,302,272,272], mean=266.4, std\u224826.04. No evidence of a demand regime change or delayed shipments; use promised lead time (0). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using defaults: (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std to align OR backend base-stock with observed demand while keeping holding cost pressure moderate (profit $2 vs holding $1 implies moderate service level).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. No on-hand or in-transit; recent concluded periods show lead_time=0 for orders in Periods 1\u20132. Demand history (including Period1=287, Period2=548) shows a recent upward shift; to react while limiting overreaction I use an EWMA for demand forecast (gamma=0.4). Set L by averaging observed lead times (0). mu_hat = EWMA forecast for next-period demand (includes all samples) and sigma_hat = default pooled std scaled by sqrt(1+L). This raises the base-stock to cover the recent spike while keeping volatility estimated from full history to avoid excess holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Recent demand spike in Period 2 (548 units) indicates a possible upward demand regime; using EWMA (gamma=0.4) to adapt forecasts.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Observed concluded lead times in Periods 1-3 are 0; no evidence of loss\u2014use calculated L=0. Current on-hand=90, in-transit=0; recent demands show a jump (548 in Period 2) so continue EWMA to adapt quickly (gamma=0.4). EWMA across historical series yields forecast S=389.99 \u2192 mu_hat=(1+L)*S=389.99. Use default volatility (std of all 8 observed samples) \u2192 sigma_hat=97.74. These settings raise the base-stock to cover the higher recent mean while sigma captures the larger demand variability, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. Recent demands: periods 1-4 = [287,548,399,338]; historical seed = [231,255,302,272,272]. All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 -> no evidence of delayed or lost shipments. Period-2 spike (548) and subsequent elevated demands indicate an upward demand regime; I adapt forecasts with an EWMA (gamma=0.4) to be responsive while smoothing noise. Chosen L: default promised lead time 0 (observed lead_times all 0). mu_hat: EWMA_gamma with gamma=0.4 on full demand history => EWMA demand = 369.6009, (1+L)*EWMA = 369.6009. sigma_hat: default using std of all samples scaled by sqrt(1+L) => std \u2248 92.285. These parameters raise the base-stock to capture the new higher-demand regime while keeping safety stock calibrated to observed volatility; using EWMA prevents overreacting to a single spike but responds to sustained uplift.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed upward demand regime after Period 2 spike (548) with sustained higher demands (399,338); adapting forecast via EWMA gamma=0.4 (EWMA demand \u2248369.6). Lead time remains 0 (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 historically; on-hand=160, in-transit=0, so no incoming stock this period. Demand recent series: [287,548,399,338,252]. I keep L=promised (0) since concluded lead times are consistently 0. I use EWMA (gamma=0.4) to adapt to the confirmed upward regime earlier while remaining responsive to recent softening; EWMA of recent demands = 323.9184 \u2192 mu_hat = (1+L)*323.9184 = 323.9184. I set sigma_hat using default (sqrt(1+L)*std of all samples) to capture observed volatility; sample std \u2248104.1309 \u2192 sigma_hat = 104.1309. These parameters raise the mean forecast to reflect the higher recent baseline while the default volatility keeps safety stock reasonable for the OR backend's capped ordering rule.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25. Recent periods (P2=548, P3=399, P4=338, P5=252, P6=329) confirm the previously detected upward demand regime. All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 so use L=0. Use EWMA (gamma=0.4) to adapt quickly to the higher mean (EWMA \u2248 369.6) for mu_hat. Volatility is elevated; use recent_N=6 (most recent 6 demand samples) to estimate sigma_hat (std \u2248 96.0) so the OR engine adds appropriate safety stock while limiting holding cost.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. Recent demand series shows an elevated regime after Period 2 spike; concluded arrivals in history all show lead_time=0 (no overdue/lost shipments). I continue the EWMA approach (gamma=0.4) to adapt quickly to the higher recent demand while keeping L=0 since all concluded orders reported lead_time=0. EWMA demand forecast (1+L)*S_t = 361.57 units balances service level against holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1. Volatility estimated at sigma_hat=97.40 units to inform safety stock in the OR backend.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained higher-demand regime: EWMA(gamma=0.4) updated EWMA\u2248361.57 using demands [287,548,399,338,252,329,415]; lead time remains 0 (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0).

Past carry-over established an upward demand regime; continue using EWMA to adapt quickly. Set L to promised default (0) because all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0. Use EWMA (gamma=0.4) for mu_hat to track elevated demand (EWMA \u2248 361.57). Use default sigma as population/sample std of concluded demands (std \u2248 91.2) scaled by sqrt(1+L). These parameters keep base-stock responsive to the sustained higher demand while capping inventory risk given holding cost.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=96, in-transit=0; demand remains elevated so keep forecast responsive. Set L to promised (0) since all observed lead_times=0.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22. Recent history shows sustained higher-demand regime (multiple periods with demand >300) and all concluded orders show lead_time=0. I keep L at the promised lead time (default=0) because concluded arrivals consistently report 0. For demand level I use the EWMA approach (gamma=0.4) already established in prior carry-over to adapt to the sustained higher regime; EWMA demand \u2248361.57 -> mu_hat = (1+L)*EWMA = 361.57. For volatility I use a recent_N estimate (last 7 concluded demands) to capture current variability; sample std \u224848.5 so sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std \u224848.5. These choices keep service levels aligned with the higher-demand regime while limiting extra holding cost by using observed low lead time and recent volatility.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent concluded demands show a sustained higher-demand regime. Lead time observations (all concluded arrivals) remain 0, so use L=0 (promised). To adapt quickly to regime shifts I use EWMA (gamma=0.4) for mu_hat; EWMA over concluded demands [287,548,399,338,252,329,415,382,322,308,427] = 370.9523528704, so mu_hat=(1+L)*EWMA=370.9523528704. Use sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all concluded demands) with sample std \u224882.019 (std of the 11 demands) => sigma_hat=82.0190250053. These parameters raise the base-stock to reflect the confirmed higher demand while keeping L=0 to avoid inflating pipeline expectation given no late/lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained higher-demand regime: EWMA(gamma=0.4) over concluded demands \u2192 EWMA\u2248370.95; evidence: concluded demands in Periods 1\u201311 = [287,548,399,338,252,329,415,382,322,308,427]. Lead time remains 0 in all concluded arrivals.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 historically (Periods 1\u201312), so keep L=0. Demand shows a sustained higher-demand regime; continue EWMA forecast with gamma=0.4 (previously established). EWMA demand (1+L)*EWMA_gamma \u2248 370.95 -> set mu_hat=370.95 to cover review+lead period. Use default sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all concluded demands). Calculated std(all 12 concluded demands) \u224881.02, so sigma_hat=81.02. These parameters keep base-stock aligned to the confirmed higher-demand regime while reflecting observed volatility; with L=0 this balances service level against holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1 (q=2/(2+1)=0.666 -> higher target service level).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13. Recent concluded history (Periods 1\u201313) confirms a sustained higher-demand regime (EWMA(\u03b3=0.4)\u2248370.95) and all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0. On-hand=187, in-transit=0 \u2014 next-period demand likely ~371, so replenish to cover (1+L) period demand while controlling holding cost. I set L to promised/default (0) because concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=0. mu_hat uses the carried EWMA to be responsive to the sustained higher regime. sigma_hat uses the sample std of concluded demands to reflect observed volatility (std \u224882.72). These parameters bias the OR engine toward higher service level appropriate for the new regime while keeping holding-cost sensitivity through the backend's q-formulation.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20 (Period 15). On-hand=88, in-transit=0. All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 historically; no overdue/lost shipments. Demand history shows the previously-identified higher-demand regime but recent two demands (267,275) pulled the EWMA down. I set L to promised/default (0). I set mu_hat using EWMA (gamma=0.4) on concluded demands to adapt to regime shifts; EWMA(current)=317.27771 \u2192 mu_hat=(1+L)*EWMA=317.27771. I set sigma_hat to the default estimator: sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples)=82.85998. These choices keep the OR engine responsive to the higher but volatile demand while respecting the zero observed lead time to avoid extra pipeline buildup and excess holding cost.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27 (Period 16). All concluded arrivals through Period 15 show lead_time=0 and no lost shipments, on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 2; I use an EWMA to adapt quickly but smooth recent drops. Set L to promised (default=0) because concluded history consistently shows 0. Set mu_hat via EWMA (gamma=0.4) to react to recent demands while preserving regime signal; EWMA updated through Period 15 \u2192 \u2248323.77 (forecast for review+lead period). Set sigma_hat to default (sqrt(1+L)*std of all concluded samples) to reflect observed volatility (std \u224879.81). These choices keep the OR engine's base-stock responsive to the sustained higher-demand regime while avoiding overreaction to single-period dips; using L=0 preserves the fast replenishment implied by concluded arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Sustained higher-demand regime persists; EWMA(gamma=0.4) updated to \u2248323.77 using concluded demands through Period 15; all concluded arrivals continue to show lead_time=0 (evidence: every 'arrived' line Period 1\u201315 shows lead_time=0).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03 (Period 17). All concluded arrivals through Period 16 show lead_time=0 (every 'arrived' line lists lead_time=0), on-hand=0 and in-transit=0. Demand has been in a sustained higher regime since the large spike in Period 2. I use an EWMA (gamma=0.4) over concluded demands through Period 16 to adapt quickly to recent higher demand; EWMA(\u03b3=0.4) = 345.73997495884. With confirmed actual lead time=0, set L=0 so the forecast covers the current review+lead period. sigma_hat uses the sample std of concluded demands (periods 1\u201316) scaled by sqrt(1+L): std \u2248 74.787 (sqrt factor=1). These parameters raise the base-stock to reflect the sustained higher-demand regime while keeping holding risk moderate given holding cost = $1 and profit = $2 (service level q = 2/(2+1)=0.666.. is handled by the OR engine).

Carry-over insight: Sustained higher-demand regime confirmed through Period 16; EWMA(\u03b3=0.4) over concluded demands (Periods 1\u201316) = 345.73997495884; actual lead time continues to be 0 (every concluded arrival Period 1\u201316 shows lead_time=0).

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Context: Period 18 (2019-06-10). Recent concluded demand (Period 17) = 297; historical concluded series through Period 17 shows a sustained higher-demand regime vs initial sample. All concluded arrivals through Period 17 show lead_time=0 (no lost/delayed shipments). Decision: keep promised lead time (L=0) and continue EWMA demand forecast with gamma=0.4 (consistent with prior carry-overs) to adapt quickly to recent movements while smoothing noise. EWMA updated with Period 17 demand: EWMA_new = 0.4*297 + 0.6*345.73997495884 = 326.243984975304 \u2192 mu_hat = (1+L)*EWMA_new = 326.243984975304. Volatility: use default sample std across concluded demands (Periods 1\u201317) scaled by sqrt(1+L): std \u2248 76.165 (captures observed demand dispersion). This balances service level (EWMA raises the base stock after recent high periods) against holding cost by keeping L=0 (no extra pipeline) and using measured volatility in the OR backend cap.

Carry-over insight: Sustained higher-demand regime persists; updated EWMA(gamma=0.4) through Period 17 = 326.244 (evidence: concluded demands Periods 1\u201317; latest Period 17 demand=297). Lead time remains 0 (every concluded arrival Period 1\u201317 shows lead_time=0).

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/17 (Period 19). On-hand=59, in-transit=0. Historical concluded demands through Period 18 show a sustained higher-demand regime; all concluded arrivals (Periods 1\u201318) indicate actual lead time = 0. I keep L = promised (default 0) because concluded arrival history consistently shows lead_time=0. For demand I use EWMA (gamma=0.4) to adapt quickly to the elevated regime; updating the prior EWMA (326.244 through Period 17) with Period 18 demand=294 gives EWMA = 313.3464, so mu_hat = (1+L)*EWMA = 313.3464. For sigma_hat I use the default method (sqrt(1+L) * std of all concluded samples through Period 18). Calculated sample std \u2248 73.06, so sigma_hat = 73.06. These settings keep target base-stock responsive to the confirmed higher-demand regime while retaining L=0 (no extra pipeline buffer), minimizing holding cost given strong evidence of same-period arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Updated sustained higher-demand EWMA: gamma=0.4, EWMA through Period 18 = 313.3464 (evidence: concluded demands Periods 1\u201318 = [287,548,399,338,252,329,415,382,322,308,427,438,267,275,348,370,297,294]); actual lead time remains 0 (every concluded arrival Period 1\u201318 shows lead_time=0).

Demand regime: sustained higher-demand confirmed; continue EWMA forecast with gamma=0.4. EWMA updated with Period 19 demand=334 \u2192 EWMA = 321.60784, so set mu_hat = (1+L)*EWMA = 321.60784. Use sigma_hat = std of concluded demands \xd7 sqrt(1+L) = 73.155 (sample std over Periods 1\u201319 \u224873.155).

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/1. Product is seasonal basics (trainer socks); no calendar spikes expected this week. On-hand=65, in-transit=0 \u2192 low cover vs. recent demand. All concluded arrivals (Periods 1\u201320) show lead_time=0 so use promised lead time. Demand has been in a sustained higher regime; continue EWMA forecast (gamma=0.4) to adapt to recent downward drift. Set L=0 (promised, confirmed by concluded history). mu_hat set via EWMA(\u03b3=0.4) over concluded demands through Period 20: EWMA_new = 0.4*Demand20 + 0.6*EWMA_prev (EWMA_prev=321.60784) \u2192 mu_hat=308.5647 units (this is (1+L)*forecast). sigma_hat use default: sample std of concluded demands Periods 1\u201320 \u2192 sigma_hat=72.47. These parameters raise the base-stock to cover current elevated demand while sigma supports safety stock; L=0 prevents inflating pipeline for lead-time uncertainty since all arrivals show 0.

Carry-over insight: Updated sustained higher-demand EWMA(\u03b3=0.4) through Period 20 = 308.5647 (evidence: concluded demands Periods 1\u201320). Actual lead time remains 0 in all concluded arrivals.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-08 (Period 22). Concluded history through Period 21 shows sustained higher-demand regime versus original small-sample prior and every concluded arrival reports lead_time=0. On-hand=17, in-transit=0 so we need to restock for current-period demand. I continue the EWMA forecasting approach (gamma=0.4) used in prior periods to rapidly adapt to regime while avoiding overreaction to single weeks. Update EWMA with Period 21 demand (317) \u2192 EWMA = 311.94 units; with promised lead time 0 the review+lead demand forecast mu_hat = EWMA. Volatility is estimated from all concluded demands (Periods 1\u201321) using sample std (\u224870.92); with L=0 sigma_hat = std. These parameters keep the OR backend's base-stock responsive to elevated mean demand while the fairly large sigma allows the capped order to limit extreme ordering and control holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Sustained higher-demand regime; EWMA(\u03b3=0.4) updated through Period 21 = 311.94 (evidence: concluded demands Periods 1\u201321). Actual lead time remains 0 in all concluded arrivals.

Demand has been in a sustained higher regime; continuing EWMA(\u03b3=0.4) forecast updating prior carry-over EWMA\u2248311.94 with latest concluded demand=313 gives EWMA\u2248312.364. Use mu_hat = (1+L)*EWMA to target service while avoiding excess holding. Use sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all concluded demands) \u224867.93 to reflect observed volatility and feed OR backend cap calculation.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/22. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded demands (Periods 1\u201323) show a sustained higher-demand regime; recent EWMA(\u03b3=0.4) captures this while smoothing spikes. No evidence of delayed or lost shipments (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0). Set L to promised (0) to match observed arrivals. Use EWMA(\u03b3=0.4) for mu_hat to target service during the same-period demand; sigma_hat set to sample std to reflect observed demand volatility. These settings raise target stock to reduce stockouts (improving profit from sales) while sigma-driven safety stock controls excessive holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $465.00

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent concluded demands show a sustained higher-demand regime; I continue using EWMA (gamma=0.4) to track the regime. Update EWMA with latest concluded demands through Period 24: EWMA after Period 22 = 311.94 (carry-over), after Period 23 (demand=352) \u2192 327.964, after Period 24 (demand=277) \u2192 307.5784. Promised lead time is 0 and all concluded arrivals through Period 24 show lead_time=0, so use L=0. Set mu_hat as EWMA \xd7 (1+L) to reflect the current single-period demand forecast. Volatility is estimated explicitly at sigma_hat=100 to reflect observed demand variability and to avoid understocking given high demand spikes. These parameters bias the OR engine toward service (higher base-stock) while acknowledging holding cost ($1) relative to profit ($2).

Carry-over insight: Sustained higher-demand regime confirmed through Period 24; EWMA(gamma=0.4) updated to \u2248307.58 (evidence: concluded demands through Periods 1\u201324, latest demands 352 then 277). Actual lead time remains 0 in all concluded arrivals through Period 24.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent concluded history through Period 25 continues to show lead_time=0 for every concluded arrival; demand remains in the higher regime but the EWMA(\u03b3=0.4) has moved down after Period 25's demand=256. I set L to promised (0) because all concluded arrivals support lead_time=0. I use EWMA(\u03b3=0.4) for mu_hat to adapt quickly to the recent downward move: EWMA_prev\u2248307.58 (through P24) updated with P25=256 \u2192 mu_hat=(1+L)*EWMA_new\u2248286.948. For sigma_hat I use the default population scaling (sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples)) to reflect observed variability across 25 concluded periods; computed std\u224867.14, so sigma_hat\u224867.14. These settings keep the base-stock responsive to recent demand shifts while the default sigma preserves service-level sizing against historical variability.

Carry-over insight: EWMA(\u03b3=0.4) updated through Period 25 = 286.948 (evidence: concluded demands through P25; latest demand P25=256); actual lead time remains 0 in all concluded arrivals.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). On-hand=46, in-transit=0. Historical concluded demands (Periods 1\u201326) show a sustained higher-demand regime vs initial baseline; all concluded arrivals indicate actual lead_time=0. I keep L at promised (0) because every concluded arrival shows lead_time=0. I set demand forecast using the EWMA method (gamma=0.4) used in prior carry-over insights to remain adaptive to recent drops; EWMA updated through Period 26 = 275.3688 units (incorporates Period 26 demand=258). I set sigma_hat using the sample std of concluded demands (Periods 1\u201326) scaled by sqrt(1+L) -> std \u224867.56. These choices keep the OR backend's base-stock responsive to recent downward movement while preserving the higher-regime prior; L=0 ensures the backend uses same-period arrivals as observed, and the EWMA reduces overstock risk given low on-hand (46) and zero in-transit.

Carry-over insight: Sustained higher-demand regime persists but recent demands declined; EWMA(\u03b3=0.4) updated through Period 26 = 275.3688 (evidence: concluded demands Periods 1\u201326). Actual lead time remains 0 in all concluded arrivals (Periods 1\u201326).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19 (Period 28). All concluded arrivals through Period 27 show lead_time=0 and demand has been in a sustained higher regime; recent-period EWMA (\u03b3=0.4) is used to adapt quickly to recent declines. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish for the upcoming period. Set L=0 (promised and observed). mu_hat = (1+L)*EWMA(\u03b3=0.4) updated with Period 27 demand (301) \u2192 EWMA \u2248 285.62, which targets service for the current period's demand while limiting overstock. sigma_hat uses default scaling of historical variability (std of concluded demands \u224867.89) to reflect demand volatility for safety stock. These parameters balance the profit/holding cost tradeoff (q = 2/(2+1)=0.666...) by using an EWMA mean to be responsive to regime shifts while keeping safety stock proportional to observed variability.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26 (Period 29). Historical concluded demands show a sustained higher-demand regime; all concluded arrivals indicate actual lead time = 0. I use an EWMA (gamma=0.4) to keep the forecast responsive to recent week-to-week swings. EWMA updated through the most recent concluded demands (Periods 1\u201328) = 288.97 units \u2192 mu_hat = (1+L)*EWMA = 288.97. Promised lead time is 0 and concluded history consistently shows lead_time=0, so L set to promised (0). I set sigma_hat explicitly to 80 units to reflect observed demand variability and avoid underestimating risk; this balances service level (profit $2 vs holding $1) while limiting excess inventory given current on-hand=22 and no in-transit units.

Carry-over insight: Updated sustained higher-demand EWMA(\u03b3=0.4)=288.97 through concluded Periods 1\u201328; actual lead time remains 0 (every concluded arrival Period 1\u201328 shows lead_time=0).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). History shows consistent concluded arrivals with lead_time=0 and a sustained higher-demand regime; recent EWMA(\u03b3=0.4) is used to adapt quickly to level shifts. On-hand=97, in-transit=0 so we must replenish to cover expected next-period demand. Choose L=default (promised 0) because every concluded arrival shows lead_time=0. Set mu_hat via EWMA(\u03b3=0.4) to respond to recent declines (incorporates Period 29 demand=229) producing mu_hat\u2248264.982 units for the (1+L) review+lead horizon. Set sigma_hat conservatively to 80 units to reflect observed demand variability and avoid excessive safety stock given holding cost. These parameters balance service (using adaptive EWMA forecast) and holding cost (moderate sigma to limit over-ordering).

Carry-over insight: Sustained higher-demand regime continues but with recent softening; EWMA(\u03b3=0.4) updated through Period 29 = 264.982 (evidence: concluded demands through Period 29, latest demand=229). Actual lead time remains 0 in all concluded arrivals.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-09 (Period 31). On-hand=15, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals all show lead_time=0 so use promised lead time. Demand exhibits a sustained higher-demand regime; continue EWMA(\u03b3=0.4) forecasting to adapt to recent softening. Set L to promised 0. Set mu_hat = (1+L)*EWMA using \u03b3=0.4 over concluded demands through Period 30 => EWMA=268.5892, so mu_hat=268.5892. Use historical sample volatility (std over 30 concluded demands \u224868.07) and default scaling for L => sigma_hat=68.07. These settings keep base-stock responsive (EWMA captures recent trend) while sigma reflects observed demand variability to balance service level vs holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-16 (Period 32). Historical concludes (Periods 1\u201331) show every arrival had lead_time=0 and demand has shifted to a sustained higher regime; continuing EWMA(\u03b3=0.4) for demand forecasting is appropriate. I updated the EWMA with the latest concluded demands (Period 30=274, Period 31=254) to produce an EWMA demand \u2248262.75 units for the review+lead horizon (L=0). On-hand=41, in-transit=0 \u2014 with L=0 we must cover current-period demand after ordering. I set L to the promised/default (0) because all concluded arrivals indicate actual lead_time=0. sigma_hat uses the sample std of all concluded demands (Periods 1\u201331) \u224867.0 to reflect observed volatility. These parameters balance service (using EWMA to track the sustained regime) against holding cost by keeping the base-stock responsive but not overly large given moderate observed variability.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date=2019-09-23 (Period 33). On-hand=40, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=0 across all periods \u2192 use L=0. Demand regime: sustained higher-demand regime tracked with EWMA(\u03b3=0.4). I updated the EWMA through concluded Period 32 (EWMA_32 \u2248256.85) using recent concluded demands (Periods 30\u201332 = 274,254,248) on top of prior EWMA_29=264.982. Given the continued variability in weekly demand (range ~229\u2013548 historically) I set sigma explicitly to capture demand volatility (~80 units). These parameters (L=0, mu_hat based on EWMA, sigma_hat conservative) keep the OR engine\u2019s base-stock responsive to the currently softened but still elevated demand while limiting excess inventory given holding cost = $1/unit and profit = $2/unit.

Carry-over insight: Sustained higher-demand regime with EWMA(\u03b3=0.4) maintained; actual lead time remains 0 in all concluded arrivals. EWMA updated through Period 32 = 256.85.

Daily Reward (R_t): $574.00

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-30 (Period 34). Recent concluded demand in Period 33=405 pushes the EWMA(\u03b3=0.4) upward from prior level (256.85 through P32) to \u2248316.11 (0.4*405 + 0.6*256.85). All concluded arrivals through Period 33 show lead_time=0, so actual lead time remains 0. I use L=explicit 0 to reflect observed same-period arrivals. I forecast demand across review+lead as EWMA-based to quickly adapt to the recent spike: mu_hat = (1+L)*EWMA \u2248316.11. Volatility is set explicitly to 90 units (reflecting observed demand swings) so the OR backend can size safety stock without overstocking. These settings prioritize service (higher mu_hat) given recent spikes while capping excessive holding via a moderate sigma estimate.

Carry-over insight: Updated sustained higher-demand EWMA: EWMA(\u03b3=0.4) through concluded Periods 1\u201333 = 316.11 (evidence: P33 demand=405; previous EWMA through P32=256.85). Actual lead time confirmed = 0 in all concluded arrivals through Period 33.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-07 (Period 35). Product is seasonal basic socks; recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime. All concluded arrivals through Period 34 show lead_time=0 so use promised lead time L=0. Use EWMA(\u03b3=0.4) demand forecast to adapt to regime; previous EWMA through P33=316.11, add P34 demand=312 \u2192 updated EWMA = 0.4*312 + 0.6*316.11 = 314.466. Set mu_hat = (1+L)*EWMA = 314.466. Volatility estimated explicitly at \u03c3\u0302=75 units (reasonable dispersion around recent demands). On-hand=71, in-transit=0; with L=0 orders arrive same period so policy will size orders to cover current-period demand plus safety. This balances profit ($2) vs holding cost ($1) by targeting an EWMA-driven base stock and a moderate \u03c3 to avoid excessive inventory.

Carry-over insight: Updated sustained higher-demand EWMA(\u03b3=0.4) through concluded Period 34 = 314.466; actual lead time confirmed = 0 in all concluded arrivals through Period 34.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-14 (Period 36). Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=0 so use promised lead time L=0. Demand regime has been consistently above the original small-sample mean; follow the established EWMA tracker (gamma=0.4) to adapt quickly to recent softening. EWMA updated through Period 35 = 295.08 units \u2192 set mu_hat = (1+L)*EWMA = 295.08. On-hand = 92 and in-transit = 0; with L=0 the OR backend will compare base_stock to on-hand only, so lowering mu_hat from prior higher values reduces holding cost while retaining service for expected demand. Volatility is moderate; set sigma_hat explicitly to 80 units to reflect observed demand swings (~\xb170\u2013120) and to avoid overreacting to single-week spikes.

Carry-over insight: EWMA(gamma=0.4) updated through Period 35 = 295.08 (evidence: concluded demands through Period 35, latest demand=266); actual lead time remains 0 in all concluded arrivals.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21 P37. On-hand=84, in-transit=0. All concluded arrivals through P36 show lead_time=0 so use promised lead time L=0. Continue EWMA demand forecasting with gamma=0.4 (consistent with prior carry-over), updated EWMA = 273.048 after including P36 demand=240 \u2192 mu_hat=(1+L)*EWMA=273.048. Demand variability observed historically (~60\u201390); set sigma_hat explicit=70 to capture volatility and avoid excessive stock. This keeps base-stock moderate (z*\u22480.43 for q=2/(2+1)) to balance service level vs. holding cost given current on-hand and zero pipeline.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 \u2192 no pipeline; all concluded arrivals through Period 37 show lead_time=0 so actual lead time remains 0. Demand regime has been consistently tracked with EWMA(\u03b3=0.4); updating that EWMA with Period 37 demand=306 gives EWMA_new = 0.4*306 + 0.6*295.08 = 299.448. I keep L = promised/default (0) because every concluded arrival shows lead_time=0. I set mu_hat via EWMA(\u03b3=0.4) to adapt quickly to recent shifts while avoiding overreaction. For sigma_hat I provide an explicit volatility estimate (\u224890 units) to reflect observed demand variability (large spikes earlier but recent variability moderate); this balances service (higher base-stock) vs holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead time = 0 through Period 37 (every concluded arrival shows lead_time=0); EWMA(\u03b3=0.4) updated through Period 37 = 299.448 (evidence: prior EWMA 295.08 updated with Period 37 demand=306).

Demand regime: continue EWMA(\u03b3=0.4) forecasting; updating prior EWMA with Period 38 demand=276 yields EWMA \u2248 290.07 \u2192 mu_hat = (1+L)*EWMA = 290.0688. Volatility: explicit sigma_hat=90 to provide moderate safety given recent demand variability (range ~229\u2013548) while limiting holding cost. These parameters favor service (profit $2 vs holding $1) but avoid excessive inventory given current on-hand and no pipeline.

Carry-over insight: EWMA(\u03b3=0.4) updated through concluded Period 38 = 290.0688 (evidence: included Period 38 demand=276); actual lead time remains 0 in all concluded arrivals through Period 38.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 consistently. Recent demands have softened (Period 39 demand=241), so I continue the EWMA(\u03b3=0.4) forecasting approach used previously to adapt quickly to regime shifts. EWMA updated to 270.44128 units/period (1-period demand forecast). I set L to the promised lead time (0) because all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0. For volatility I choose an explicit sigma_hat=80.0 to reflect observed demand variability and keep safety stock moderate given $2 profit / $1 holding tradeoff.

Carry-over insight: EWMA(\u03b3=0.4) updated through concluded Period 39 = 270.44128 (evidence: prior EWMA 290.0688 updated with Period 39 demand=241); actual lead time remains 0 in all concluded arrivals through Period 39.

Carry-over insight: EWMA(\u03b3=0.4) updated through concluded Period 39 = 270.44128 (evidence: prior EWMA 290.0688 updated with Period 39 demand=241); actual lead time remains 0 in all concluded arrivals through Period 39.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). All concluded arrivals through Period 40 show actual lead time = 0; on-hand=40, in-transit=0. Demand regime has been tracked with EWMA(\u03b3=0.4); updating EWMA with Period 40 demand=252 gives EWMA\u2248263.0648. I keep promised lead time (default) since concluded history confirms L=0. I set mu_hat via EWMA(\u03b3=0.4) to be responsive to recent softening (keeps order targets moderate given low pipeline). I use an explicit sigma_hat=80 units (reasonable volatility given historical demand swings) so the OR backend balances service level vs holding cost without generating excessive safety stock when on-hand is low. This reduces stockouts risk while limiting holding cost exposure.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead time = 0 through Period 40; sustained higher-demand regime tracked but recent softening\u2014EWMA(\u03b3=0.4) updated through Period 40 = 263.0648.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/25 (Period 42). Concluded history through Period 41 shows consistent same-day arrivals (every concluded arrival reports lead_time=0) and recent softening in demand (Period 41 demand=210). I continue using EWMA to track the sustained higher-demand regime while adapting quickly to recent drops: EWMA gamma=0.4 updated from 263.0648 (through P40) with P41=210 \u2192 EWMA=241.83888. Lead time: all concluded arrivals period 1\u201341 show lead_time=0, so keep L=promised (0). mu_hat set via EWMA (1+L)*EWMA to reflect the smoothed forecast for the review+lead period. sigma_hat set explicit to 90.0 to reflect observed demand volatility (historical spread, recent variability) while avoiding overreacting to one low period. Current on-hand=79, in-transit=0 \u2014 parameters aim to balance service (capture smoothed demand ~242) vs holding cost.

Carry-over insight: EWMA(\u03b3=0.4) updated through concluded Period 41 = 241.83888 (evidence: updated with Period 41 demand=210); actual lead time remains 0 in all concluded arrivals (Periods 1\u201341).

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). History shows a sustained higher-demand regime tracked with EWMA(\u03b3=0.4); most recent concluded EWMA through Period 42 = 241.83888. All concluded arrivals continue to show lead_time=0. I set L=0 (promised lead time consistent with concluded evidence), use EWMA(\u03b3=0.4) for mu_hat to remain responsive to the regime (mu_hat = EWMA over review+lead), and choose a conservative explicit sigma_hat=80 to reflect observed demand volatility and avoid understocking during spikes. These settings raise target base-stock toward recent effective demand while capping excess inventory via the OR engine's cap.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date=2019-12-09 (Period 44). On-hand=195, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 consistently through Period 43. I continue to track the higher-demand regime with EWMA (\u03b3=0.4). Using last recorded EWMA through Period 41 = 241.83888, update with Period 42 demand=354 \u2192 EWMA42=286.7033, then Period 43 demand=143 \u2192 EWMA43=229.2220. Set L to promised lead time (0) because every concluded arrival shows lead_time=0. Set mu_hat using EWMA_gamma (\u03b3=0.4) => (1+L)*EWMA43 = 229.222. Volatility observed historically is moderate; set sigma_hat explicit=90 to reflect demand variability and avoid excess holding given current on-hand stock. These parameters aim to balance service (use EWMA to follow recent swings) and holding cost (moderate sigma to cap ordering).

Carry-over insight: EWMA(\u03b3=0.4) updated to 229.222 through concluded Period 43 (updated from 241.83888 with demands 354 then 143); actual lead time remains 0 in all concluded arrivals through Period 43.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:

Demand has been tracked with EWMA(\u03b3=0.4) in prior carry-overs; updating EWMA with Period 44 demand=209 gives EWMA=221.1332. I keep L as promised (0) because every concluded arrival shows lead_time=0. Use EWMA(\u03b3=0.4) for mu_hat to remain responsive to recent softening while preserving the higher-regime memory. Set sigma_hat explicitly to 80 units (sqrt(1+L)*80) as a conservative volatility capturing demand swings seen historically (~80\u2013100) to avoid under-ordering. These params aim to balance service (use recent EWMA forecast) vs holding cost (no inflated safety stock given short lead time and low on-hand).

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (one week before Christmas). On-hand=12, in-transit=0 \u2192 risk of stockout this period. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=0, so keep L=0 (default promised). Demand forecast: continue EWMA(\u03b3=0.4) regime used in history; update EWMA with latest concluded demand (Period 45 demand=231) producing EWMA \u2248229.93 and set mu_hat=(1+L)*EWMA. Volatility: recent demand variability moderate; use an explicit sigma_hat=90 to give the OR engine reasonable safety stock without heavy holding cost. These settings bias orders toward meeting immediate high-probability demand this week (short lead time, low on-hand) while capping excessive inventory via OR backend cap.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30 (Period 47). Recent history shows lead_time consistently 0 (every concluded arrival Periods 1\u201346). Demand regime softened recently; I continue the proven EWMA(\u03b3=0.4) approach to adapt quickly to recent drops. I set L=default(promised)=0 because all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0. I set mu_hat using EWMA(\u03b3=0.4) updated through the most recent concluded demands (Periods 1\u201346) \u2192 EWMA \u2248 224.65, so mu_hat=(1+L)*EWMA. I set sigma_hat to an explicit volatility estimate (85 units) because recent demand volatility appears moderate (historic demand range ~143\u2013548) and the OR backend expects a \u03c3\u0302; this keeps the safety stock reasonable while limiting holding cost given on-hand=37 and no in-transit. These parameters balance service (using EWMA to follow recent demand) against holding cost (conservative \u03c3\u0302).

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed = 0 through Period 46 (every concluded arrival shows lead_time=0); sustained demand regime has softened\u2014EWMA(\u03b3=0.4) updated through Period 46 = 224.648 (evidence: applied \u03b3=0.4 sequentially to concluded demands through Periods 44\u201346: P44=209, P45=231, P46=224).
