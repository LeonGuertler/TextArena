{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: concluded history shows actual lead time = 0 (orders in previous periods arrived same period). Inventory & demand analysis: on-hand=137, in-transit=0. Recent realized demand (Periods 42\u201346) averages ~232 units/week (354,143,209,231,224 -> mean \u2248232). OR recommends 222 units based on promised lead time and longer historical samples; with L=0 orders arrive same period and will immediately satisfy demand. Strategy: target OR's base-stock level (~222) but subtract current on-hand to avoid excess holding cost. Order = 222 \u2212 137 = 85 units (floor at 0). This adds supply to meet expected single-period demand while limiting holding cost given already-elevated on-hand inventory. Final safety: no in-transit units and lead time=0 justifies filling only the gap to OR's recommended level.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Ordering 85 units to top up on-hand (137) to OR's recommended level of ~222 based on recent mean demand (~232) and confirmed 0-day lead time; minimizes extra holding cost.",
