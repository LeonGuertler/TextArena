Risk assessment vs. costs: supplier unreliability means some in-transit is risky, but we lack CONCLUDED evidence that this specific in-transit quantity is lost. Ordering now will only arrive after the lead time (\u22651\u20133 periods observed) and incurs holding cost $1/unit/period once it arrives.

Rationale: the large in-transit quantity (3217) is likely sufficient to meet expected demand even allowing for some losses; placing additional order now risks increasing holding costs if arrivals materialize.
