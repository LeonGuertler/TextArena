{
  "rationale": "History shows supplier reliably delivers successful shipments with ~1-period lead time but many lost/delayed shipments; treat in-transit=1904 as ~50% reliable (effective \u2248952). Recent realized demand (Periods 41\u201346 = 210,354,143,209,231,224) averages \u2248228 units/period. Using promised L=2 the review+lead mean demand = 3\xd7228 \u2248 684 units.
