Inventory picture now: on-hand=0, in-transit=621 (orders from Periods 1\u20132). Lead-time inference: no concluded arrivals yet; orders placed in Periods 1\u20132 are still within promised lead time window, so we cannot assume they are lost or late. Decision logic: the target pipeline to cover the next (L+1)=5 periods is \u03bc\u0302\u22481332 units. Current pipeline+on-hand=621, leaving a shortfall \u2248711 units. OR's capped policy reduces ordering volatility (cap \u2248309 by its formula) but would leave us well short of covering expected demand over the full lead+review horizon. Given high expected demand (\u2248266/day) and profit>holding cost (profit $2 vs holding $1), it's better to replenish to cover expected (L+1) demand rather than follow OR's lower capped order. I therefore order enough to bring pipeline+order to roughly the base demand \u03bc\u0302 (i.e., order \u22481332\u2212621=711). Rounding: place order = 711 units. Risk notes: if some in-transit units are later revealed lost (no conclude after promised lead time), we will need to place emergency replenishment; conversely, if demand falls, extra inventory will incur holding cost.

Thus current pipeline (1332) already equals expected demand over the review+lead window. OR recommended 373 units based on its base-stock/cap model, but it ignores current large pipeline. Ordering more now would raise holding cost ($1/unit/period) with little upside since pipeline should cover expected demand. Risk: some in-transit units might be lost or delayed beyond promised LT; we have not seen any conclude messages indicating arrivals, so that risk must be monitored in subsequent periods.
