With profit $4 and holding $1 (critical fractile q=0.8 \u2192 moderate safety), I want to cover expected single-period demand plus a small safety buffer but avoid excessive holding into holiday week.

OR recommends 312 (uses longer history and promised L). With profit $4 and holding $1 the critical fractile is 0.8 (bias toward availability), but the most recent mean (~229) is well below OR's cap-driven recommendation. To balance lost sales vs holding cost before Christmas (no confirmed holiday spike in data window), I target coverage near the recent mean: order = max(0, target_demand - on_hand) with target_demand \u2248 229 \u2192 order \u2248 180; round up slightly for conservatism to 200 units.
