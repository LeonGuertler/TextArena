Given: (a) large existing pipeline that will continue to replenish (history confirms steady 4-period arrivals), (b) high holding cost relative to profit (holding $1 vs profit $4 means not wanting to overstock), and (c) OR's recommendation ignores actual pipeline and confirmed lead time behavior, placing a fresh order now risks excess ending inventory and holding cost.

Demand view: recent realized weekly demands mostly in the 240\u2013360 range with some spikes (e.g., 354) but no new sustained >3-period shift; the earlier carry-over regime shift is historical and not increasing now. OR recommends 418 using promised L and historical mean; that would raise available stock to 1394 (976+418) which still sits below a 5-period demand if single-period mean were ~300 (5\xd7300=1500) but would create substantial holding cost given observed demand nearer 275\u2013320. Risk assessment: supplier lead time reliable at 4, lost orders unlikely. With profit $4 and holding $1, OR targets higher service level; however current pipeline is already large (976) and recent demand has softened relative to the extreme spikes earlier. Action: scale down OR order to limit holding cost while keeping decent coverage for lead time: order 200 units. This leaves expected pipeline+on-hand = 1176, providing ~3.5\u20134.5 periods cover depending on demand realization, balancing service and holding costs.
