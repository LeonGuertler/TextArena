{
  "rationale": "World/calendar: SKU is womens fine-knit trainer socks (low seasonality around late Dec). Historical prior baseline ~266 but recent concluded demands (P42\u2013P46 = 354,143,209,231,224) average \u2248232 units/period, indicating a sustained softened near-term regime. Lead time: concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time = 4 periods. Decision logic: with lead_time=4 we must cover L+1 = 5 periods of demand (current period plus next 4). Forecast demand = 232 units/period \u2192 5*232 = 1,160 units required. Current coverage = on-hand (124) + in-transit (804) = 928. Shortfall = 1,160 \u2212 928 = 232. Because holding cost is high ($1/unit/period) vs profit ($2/unit), avoid over-ordering; order the shortfall to target the forecasted coverage while keeping inventory lean.",
