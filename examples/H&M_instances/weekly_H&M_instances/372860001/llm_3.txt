Lead time and pipeline: promised lead time = 0, but no concluded arrivals observed yet so actual lead time is unconfirmed; on-hand = 0, in-transit = 0. Decision logic: because actual lead time is unknown, but promised 0 suggests same-period arrival is possible, we avoid building multi-period inventory (holding cost $1/unit/period vs profit $4/unit) and aim to meet one-period expected demand. I target the recent-stable demand level (\u2248272) rounded to integer to balance service and holding cost. Order quantity = 272.",
