Supplier lead-time evidence: two consecutive concludes show orders arriving with lead_time=1 (P1->P2, P2->P3), suggesting actual lead_time is likely 1 though promised=2 (not yet 3+ periods of evidence so not confirmed). Inventory/pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=250 (P3 order) which, if lead_time=1, will arrive during Period 4 and be available for demand. Risk balance: if actual L=1 we only need coverage for current+1 future period; if L=2 we should cover current+2 but that is costly in holding. I adopt the more-likely L=1 inference but keep moderate safety. Forecast used: ~350 units/period (compromise between historical ~266 and recent elevated demand).
