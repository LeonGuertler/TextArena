Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11; no arrivals, on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical demand looks stable: samples [231,255,302,272,272], mean=266.4, std\u224823.29. Promised lead time = 0; no evidence of delayed/lost shipments yet. Use default estimators to let OR backend compute base-stock balancing $2 profit vs $1 holding cost.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. SKU 372860001 (women's fine-knit trainer socks). Period-1 conclude shows an order placed in Period 1 arrived in Period 1 (arrived=278, lead_time=0). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 now. Historical demand samples = [231,255,302,272,272] (mean 266.4, population std \u224823.296). I set L using observed lead times (average of concluded lead times = 0) because the only concluded shipment had lead_time=0 and no evidence of delays/losses yet. mu_hat uses the default (1+L)*mean_all = 266.4 to target average demand for the review+lead period. sigma_hat uses the default sqrt(1+L)*std_all = 23.296 to represent demand volatility. These choices align the OR backend's base-stock calculation with recent realized service/lead-time while avoiding overstock given holding cost = $1 and profit = $2.

Carry-over insight: Observed lead_time=0 (Period 1 conclude: ordered on Period 1, arrived in Period 1; lead_time=0).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. History shows two concluded arrivals with lead_time=0 (Period1 and Period2). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 and recent observed demand spike (Period2 demand=548) but historical sample mean (5 samples) is 266.4. I set L using the average of observed lead times (calculate) => 0. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to defaults so the OR backend uses full-sample statistics scaled by (1+L): mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples)=266.4 to represent expected demand over review+lead; sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples)=23.30 to capture observed variability. This keeps the target base-stock tied to empirical demand while acknowledging zero observed lead time and the need to replenish immediately given zero on-hand/pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $712.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. SKU 372860001 (trainer socks) shows zero on-hand and zero in-transit; recent demand history is high relative to inventory. Concluded arrivals for Periods 1\u20133 all report lead_time=0 (orders placed in each period arrived same period), so actual lead time appears stable at 0. No evidence of lost shipments. I set L to the average of observed lead times (calculate) = 0. For demand I use the default (1+L)\xd7mean of all past samples to capture the overall demand level: mean(demands) = 266.4 so mu_hat = 266.4. For volatility I use the default population std scaled by sqrt(1+L): std(all samples) = 23.29 so sigma_hat = 23.29. These parameters yield a base-stock appropriate for current demand while keeping holding exposure moderate given holding cost = $1 and profit = $2.

Carry-over insight: Observed sustained lead_time=0 based on conclude messages: Period1 arrived=278 (ordered P1, lead_time=0); Period2 arrived=281 (ordered P2, lead_time=0); Period3 arrived=356 (ordered P3, lead_time=0).

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. SKU 372860001 (trainer socks). Recent concluded history shows sustained same-day arrivals (lead_time=0) and high realized demand (period demands: 287,548,399,338; historical samples: [231,255,302,272,272]). Current on-hand=28, in-transit=0 so exposure to stockout this period is real. I set L based on observed concludes (average observed lead_time=0). For demand I use the default (1+L)*mean of all samples to be stable given limited data: mu_hat = 266.4 units covers expected demand this review+lead period. Volatility uses default population std scaled by sqrt(1+L): sigma_hat = 23.29 to capture observed variability. These parameters produce a base-stock near the service level implied by profit/holding (2/(2+1)=0.667) while avoiding excessive holding given current inventory and zero in-transit.

Daily Reward (R_t): $391.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/18. On-hand=113, in-transit=0. Concluded history shows consistent same-day arrivals (lead_time=0) and recent demand sequence (Periods1-5) = [287,548,399,338,252] with elevated mean and volatility vs older baseline. I set L based on the average of observed lead times (all concluded lead_times=0). For demand I use recent_N=5 to capture the current regime (post-spike) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the last 5 realized demands; this raises the base-stock to meet higher short-term demand while sigma_hat captures heightened uncertainty so the OR backend's cap constraint prevents extreme single-period orders. This balances service level (profit $2 vs holding $1) against holding cost given limited on-hand inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $572.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25. Recent concluded history (Periods 1-6) shows consistent same-period arrivals; demand recent series = [287,548,399,338,252,329], on-hand=86, in-transit=0. Lead-time: all concluded messages show lead_time=0 so I use the average observed lead-time=0. Demand forecast: use default (1+L)*mean of all observed samples to capture full recent demand level; mean demand = 358.8333 \u2192 mu_hat=358.8333. Volatility: use default sqrt(1+L)*std of all samples to reflect measured variability; sample std \u2248105.185 \u2192 sigma_hat=105.185. These settings (L=0, mu_hat at recent mean, sigma_hat at observed std) ask the OR engine for a base-stock sized to meet current high mean demand while reflecting high variance; with profit=2 and holding=1 the backend will scale service level accordingly. No overdue shipments detected (in-transit=0 and recent arrivals consistent), so no lead-time inflation.

Carry-over insight: sustained lead_time=0 based on concluded arrivals: P1 arrived (ordered P1, lead_time=0); P2 arrived (ordered P2, lead_time=0); P3 arrived (ordered P3, lead_time=0); subsequent P4\u2013P6 also concluded with lead_time=0.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent concluded periods (P1\u2013P7) show consistent same-period arrivals (lead_time=0) and elevated, volatile demand (demands in P1\u2013P7 = [287,548,399,338,252,329,415]). I therefore set L based on observed lead times (calculate -> 0). Demand exhibits a persistent regime since P1; I use recent_N=7 (all concluded periods) to capture current mean/volatility. mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_recent = 367.0 units to cover expected period demand; sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std_recent = 98.32 to reflect demand variability. These parameters raise the base-stock to meet high recent demand while the sigma preserves safety stock for service; L=0 keeps pipeline short to avoid excess holding costs given confirmed fast arrivals.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=0; demand has increased vs. the seed samples, so I use a recent-sample forecast. On-hand=28, in-transit=0 so we need to replenish to cover expected next-period demand. Set L to promised (default 0). For demand I use recent_N=5 (periods 4\u20138 demands: 338,252,329,415,382) giving mean=343.2 units (mu_hat=(1+L)*mean). For volatility I use recent_N=5 population std of those five samples = 55.15. These parameters raise the base-stock to reflect the higher recent demand while keeping lead-time at 0 (minimizing unnecessary pipeline given reliable concluded arrivals).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15. Recent concluded history (Periods 1\u20139) shows consistent same-period arrivals (lead_time=0) and elevated demand versus the earlier 5-sample seed. I detect a demand regime shift beginning around Period 5 (higher mean, higher variance). Therefore keep L at promised/default (0) consistent with sustained observations; set demand forecast using recent_N (last 5 concluded demands, Periods 5\u20139) to capture the new regime; set sigma_hat from the same recent window to reflect current volatility. This balances service (higher mu_hat to avoid stockouts given elevated demand) against holding cost by using only a 5-period recent window rather than all history.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/22. Recent concluded history shows consistent same-period arrivals (lead_time=0 through Period 10). On-hand=59, in-transit=0. Use promised/default lead time 0 given sustained evidence. Demand history (seed samples [231,255,302,272,272]) mean=266.4; volatility std\u224826.04. Setting L=0 and using population sample-based defaults keeps base-stock anchored to historical mean while limiting excess inventory given holding cost=$1 vs profit=$2 (service quantile q=0.5). These parameters balance service level and holding cost given stable lead time and no in-transit stock.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29. Concluded history shows consistent same-period arrivals (lead_time=0) through Period 11 and recent demand is higher than the 5-sample prior. I therefore accept promised lead time (L=0). I use all concluded demand samples (Periods 1\u201311) to estimate demand: mean demand = 364.27 units \u2192 mu_hat = (1+L)*mean = 364.27. Sample std dev \u2248 82.00 \u2192 sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std = 82.00. These settings keep the OR engine's base-stock anchored to observed recent demand (higher than earlier 5-sample prior) while preserving the low lead-time assumption to avoid unnecessary pipeline build-up and extra holding cost.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Concluded history shows sustained actual lead_time=0 (multiple concluded arrivals from P1\u2013P12 all with lead_time=0). I set L to the promised/default (0) consistent with concluded evidence. Demand prior (provided samples [231,255,302,272,272]) has mean 266.4 and sample std \u224826.04; using default methods (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std yields mu_hat=266.4 and sigma_hat=26.04. These parameters maintain a base-stock sized to cover typical demand this review+lead period while sigma captures observed variability; with profit/holding ratio (2/1) this supports a moderately high service level without excessive holding cost given current zero inventory and rapid replenishment.

Carry-over insight: sustained lead_time=0 evidenced by concluded arrivals P1\u2013P12 all showing lead_time=0.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13 (Period 14). Product is basic socks; no calendar spike expected now. Inventory: on-hand=110, in-transit=0. Concluded history shows sustained actual lead_time=0 through Period 13. Historical demand samples (seed) = [231,255,302,272,272], mean=266.4, std\u224823.296. Given stable product and confirmed 0 lead-time, use promised lead time (0) and default demand estimators to let OR backend compute base stock consistent with historical mean and variance while avoiding unnecessary holding cost.

Carry-over insight: sustained lead_time=0 evidenced by concluded arrivals for orders placed in Periods 1\u201313 (all show lead_time=0).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20 (Period 15). On-hand=97, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead_time=0 for orders through Period 14, so I trust same-period arrivals. Demand historical samples provided = [231,255,302,272,272] (mean=266.4, std\u224823.29). I choose L=0 (default/promised) since concluded arrivals show sustained lead_time=0. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using defaults: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples)=266.4 to represent expected demand over review+lead window; sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples)=23.29 to capture observed variability. These parameters favour a service-driven base-stock (profit $2 vs holding $1 implies moderate service level) while keeping safety stock aligned with historical volatility, and they account for current on-hand (97) and zero pipeline when the OR engine computes order quantity.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27 (Period 16). Concluded history shows consistent same-period arrivals (lead_time=0) through Period 15; on-hand=20, in-transit=0 so pipeline is empty. Use promised lead time=0 (evidence: every concluded order from P1\u2013P15 arrived with lead_time=0). For demand forecast I use the default historical estimator: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) to let the OR engine compute base-stock from empirical mean; sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples) to reflect observed volatility. This keeps replenishment responsive (L=0) while avoiding overstating variability.

LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). SKU 372860001 (socks): on-hand=72, in-transit=0. Concluded history (Periods 1\u201317) consistently shows arrived=ordered with lead_time=0 \u2014 no evidence of lost or delayed shipments. I use promised/default lead time (L=0). Demand forecast uses the provided historical samples (mean=266.4 units); with L=0 mu_hat = (1+L)*mean = 266.4. Demand volatility uses the sample set std \u2248 23.29, so sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std = 23.29. These conservative defaults keep the OR base-stock tied to recent average demand while the low lead time minimizes pipeline, balancing service level (meet per-period demand) against holding cost.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-17. All concluded arrivals from Periods 1\u201318 show lead_time=0 (orders arrived same period). On-hand=73, in-transit=0; next-period demand expected ~recent mean. I set L=default (promised lead time=0) because concluded history consistently shows 0. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using all available demand history (Periods 1\u201318) so the OR engine's base-stock balances the $2 profit vs $1 holding cost with stable lead time; this yields a one-period forecast (1+L)\xb7mean demand and corresponding volatility to compute safety stock. This keeps service high while avoiding excessive holding given current on-hand of 73 and no pipeline.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24. Historical conclude messages (Periods 1\u201319) consistently show arrivals in the same period as order: sustained actual lead_time=0. No lost shipments or delays observed. Demand baseline uses provided historical samples [231,255,302,272,272] (mean=266.4, std\u224826.03). Promised lead time is 0 and empirical evidence confirms it; use L=0 (default). Use default mu_hat=(1+L)*mean to reflect the long-run demand (no recent changepoint or calendar spike detected). Use default sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std to represent observed variability. These settings give the OR engine a base-stock tuned to the profit/holding tradeoff while matching observed zero lead-time and documented demand variability.

These choices keep the OR base-stock close to observed demand while exploiting the low lead time to avoid excess pipeline; with profit=2 and holding=1, service-level weight is moderate (q\u22480.667), so modest safety stock (via z*) will be applied by OR engine.

Carry-over insight: Sustained actual lead_time=0 evidenced by concluded arrivals for orders placed in Periods 1\u201321 (all conclude with lead_time=0).

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-15 (Period 23). SKU 372860001 (women's fine-knit trainer socks). History shows sustained actual lead_time=0 (concluded arrivals for orders placed in Periods 1\u201322 all show lead_time=0). Current on-hand=48, in-transit=0. I set L to the promised/default 0 because concluded history confirms 0 and no overdue shipments. Demand samples (provided) have mean ~266.4 and std ~26.0; I use the default formulas so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std. These choices keep the OR engine's base-stock driven by observed demand while reflecting low lead time (minimizing pipeline) to balance high profit ($2) vs holding cost ($1).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-22 (Period 24). History shows sustained actual lead_time=0 across concluded arrivals through Period 23. On-hand=8, in-transit=0. Demand history (Periods 1\u201323) mean=343.5217 units/period, sample std=67.9779. Promised lead time=0 and concluded evidence supports using L=0. Using default formulas (review+lead =1 period), mu_hat=(1+L)*mean -> 343.5217 to target service while avoiding excess stock; sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std -> 67.9779 to capture observed variability. This balances a moderate service quantile (q = profit/(profit+holding)=2/3) with holding cost sensitivity and leverages the strong evidence of same-period arrivals to keep lead time minimal.

Carry-over insight: sustained actual lead_time=0 evidenced by concluded arrivals for orders placed in Periods 1\u201323 (all lead_time=0).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29. Product is seasonal basics (trainer socks); no calendar spikes this week. Concluded history shows sustained actual lead_time=0 for orders placed in Periods 1\u201324, so use promised/observed L=0. On-hand=83, in-transit=0; recent concluded demands are well above the small five-sample historical seed, but we keep statistical estimates anchored to provided past-samples while recognizing higher realized orders historically\u2014this setting lets the OR engine compute base-stock with conservative safety. Chosen methods: L=default (promised 0) because concluded messages uniformly show lead_time=0; mu_hat=default to reflect long-run mean demand per period scaled by (1+L); sigma_hat=default to reflect observed sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). These parameters trade off service (profit $2 vs holding $1) by yielding q = 2/(2+1)=0.666.. and an appropriate z safety factor inside the OR backend.

Carry-over insight: Sustained actual lead_time=0 evidenced by concluded arrivals for orders placed in Periods 1\u201324 (all concluded with lead_time=0).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). Historical concludes show sustained actual lead_time=0 through Period 25. On-hand=102, in-transit=0 \u2014 no overdue shipments. Use promised lead time (0) and historical demand samples as the baseline. I set L=0 (default). With L=0 I use the supplied past-demand samples (mean=266.4, std\u224826.04) to compute mu_hat and sigma_hat using the default formulas: mu_hat=(1+L)*mean_samples and sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std_samples. This balances service (targets profit-driven quantile) while avoiding excess holding given holding cost=$1/unit (keeps safety stock moderate).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). Product: socks (SKU 372860001). Profit $2, Holding $1. Concluded history through Period 26 shows sustained actual lead_time=0 (all concluded arrivals lead_time=0). On-hand=98, in-transit=0. Use promised/default lead time 0 since evidence strongly supports L=0. Demand baseline from provided historical samples [231,255,302,272,272]: mean=266.4, population std=23.295. With L=0 set mu_hat=(1+L)*mean=266.4 and sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std=23.295. These parameters reflect current rapid replenishment (L=0) and center the base-stock around recent mean demand to balance service (profit/holding ratio implies moderate service level) while avoiding excess holding given holding cost=$1/unit/period.

Use L=0 (calculated from observed concludes). Demand history (Periods 1\u201327) has mean \u2248333.07 units/week and sample std \u224867.91. With lead time 0, set mu_hat = (1+L)*mean = 333.07 and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std = 67.91. This keeps the OR engine's base-stock tied to observed high service-level demand while avoiding excessive hold cost given current on-hand stock (52) and zero in-transit.

Base demand data seed = [231,255,302,272,272] (mean=266.4, sample std\u224826.04). Profit=$2, Holding=$1 (implies moderate service target).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date=2019-09-23 (Period 33). Product is basic womens socks; no calendar spike indicated. Historical concludes P1\u2013P32 all show arrivals with lead_time=0 (sustained same-period fulfillment). On-hand=97, in-transit=0. I set L to promised/default (0) because concluded history confirms actual lead_time=0. I use default demand stats across all available samples (Periods 1\u201332) to avoid overreacting to week-to-week noise: mean demand per period = 321.625, sample std = 67.309. With L=0 mu_hat = (1+L)*mean = 321.625 and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std = 67.309. These parameters let the OR backend compute a base-stock that balances profit-driven service level (profit $2 vs holding $1 implies moderate fill-rate target) while avoiding excessive holding given current on-hand of 97 and zero in-transit.

Carry-over insight: Sustained actual lead_time=0 evidenced by concluded arrivals for orders placed in Periods 1\u201332 (all conclude with lead_time=0).

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-30. Product is basic women's socks; no major seasonal spike this week. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so no arrivals expected this period. Historical concluded arrivals show sustained actual lead_time=0 across many periods, so use promised lead time. Use demand history seed provided (samples=[231,255,302,272,272], mean=266.4, std\u224826.04). Set L via default (promised=0) so review+lead multiplier=(1+L)=1. mu_hat default => 1\xd7mean=266.4 to align base-stock with recent long-run mean demand. sigma_hat default => sqrt(1+L)\xd7std\u224826.04 to reflect observed demand variability. These settings keep orders sized to meet average weekly demand with moderate safety stock given profit/holding tradeoff (profit=$2, holding=$1).

Date 2019-10-07 (Period 35). Historical concludes show sustained actual lead_time=0. Current on-hand=34, in-transit=0 (no overdue shipments). Use promised lead time (0) and demand priors from provided sample set [231,255,302,272,272] (mean=266.4, std\u224826.03) to set base-stock inputs. This keeps (1+L)-period forecast aligned with observed weekly demand while limiting holding cost given moderate variance; with profit=$2 and holding=$1 the backend will target service without excessive inventory.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:

No evidence of lost or delayed shipments; use promised/default lead time. Use default demand estimates based on all available samples (historical seed provided) to let OR backend compute base-stock balancing profit vs. holding cost.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21 (Period 37). No external news; product is basic womens socks with stable weekly demand. Concluded history shows sustained actual lead_time=0 (all concluded orders P1\u2013P36 arrived same period). Current inventory: on-hand=104, in-transit=0 \u2014 no overdue shipments. I set L to promised/default (0) because concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=0. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the default formulas over the provided historical demand samples (mean=266.4, std\u224823.29) scaled by (1+L)=1. This gives a base_stock forecast that balances profit ($2) vs holding cost ($1) by using the OR engine's default demand estimates while keeping safety stock moderate given low observed volatility and immediate replenishment.

Carry-over insight: Sustained actual lead_time=0 evidenced by concluded arrivals for orders placed in Periods 1\u201336 (all conclude with lead_time=0).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). Historical concludes through Period 37 show fully sustained actual lead_time=0 for many periods; current on-hand=36, in-transit=0. Use promised/default lead time=0. Use default demand estimators (all-sample mean/std) because no recent changepoint or calendar event justifies deviating. Calculations: sample mean demand over Periods 1\u201337 = 319.486 units \u2192 mu_hat = (1+L)*mean = 319.486. Sample std dev = 66.906 \u2192 sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std = 66.906. These settings give the OR engine a base-stock aligned to observed demand with lead time 0, balancing service level (via mu+z\xb7sigma) against holding cost.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). Concluded history shows sustained actual lead_time=0 for all past orders; on-hand=100, in-transit=0. I use promised lead time (L=0). For demand I use the full-sample mean of concluded demands (Periods 1\u201339) to set mu_hat: mean(demand)=316.358 (forecast for the review+lead period = (1+L)*mean). I set sigma_hat to 70 units (sqrt(1+L)*std \u2248 70) as a conservative volatility estimate capturing observed spread including occasional spikes (e.g. 548, 405) to avoid understock. These parameters keep base-stock near historical mean demand while accounting for variability, balancing service level (profit $2 vs holding $1) without excessive holding cost given current on-hand.

372860001: ordered=337, arrived=337 units (ordered on Period 43, lead_time was 0 periods), starting on-hand inventory=337, demand=143, sold=143, ending on-hand inventory=194

Daily Reward (R_t): $92.00

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09 (pre-Christmas demand window). On-hand=194, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead_time=0 (sustained across many periods), so use promised/default lead time. Using historical demand seed [231,255,302,272,272]: mean=266.4 \u2192 mu_hat=(1+L)*mean=266.4. Volatility (population std) =23.293 \u2192 sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*23.293=23.293. These parameters keep the OR base-stock near observed average weekly demand while recognizing low lead time to avoid excess pipeline; with profit $2 and holding $1 the backend will target service while penalizing holding through the z* calibration.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16 (Period 45). Concluded arrivals across history consistently show actual lead_time = 0 (orders from Periods 1\u201344 all concluded with lead_time=0). Current inventory: on-hand=126, in-transit=0. I choose L by default = promised lead time (0) because concluded history shows sustained same-period arrivals. For demand I use default historical aggregation: mean of provided past-samples = 266.4 units \u2192 mu_hat = (1+L)*mean = 266.4. For volatility I use default std of samples (std \u2248 26.04) scaled by sqrt(1+L) \u2192 sigma_hat = 26.04. These settings give the OR backend a base-stock anchored to historical mean demand under confirmed zero lead time, balancing service level (uses profit/(profit+holding) to set z) against holding cost given current on-hand inventory and no in-transit pipeline.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/23 (one week before Christmas). Historical concluded arrivals show sustained actual lead_time=0 for all observed periods. Full demand history (Periods 1\u201345) has mean \u2248303.07 units/period and sample std \u224881.0. On-hand=102, in-transit=0. With promised lead_time=0 and robust evidence actual L=0, use default methods (no changepoint adjustments). These parameters provide the OR backend a base-stock equal to a one-period forecast (1+L)*mean while reflecting observed volatility, balancing service level vs holding cost ahead of a potential holiday demand spike.

Daily Reward (R_t): $340.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/30 (Period 47). All concluded arrivals through Period 46 show actual lead_time=0 (sustained). Current on-hand=108, in-transit=0. I use L=0 (default/promised) because concluded history consistently shows 0. Demand history Periods 1\u201346 mean=303.5, sample std=71.64; with L=0 the review+lead demand forecast (mu_hat) = 303.5 and sigma_hat = 71.64. These parameters keep the OR backend's base-stock tied to the full historical mean/volatility while recognizing same-period replenishment to avoid extra pipeline safety stock given reliable lead time.

Carry-over insight: Sustained actual lead_time=0 evidenced by concluded arrivals for orders placed in Periods 1\u201346 (all concluded with lead_time=0).
