Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. SKU 372860001 has on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical demand samples = [231,255,302,272,272] show no clear recent changepoint; no concluded arrivals exist to infer a different lead time. Use promised lead time and population statistics: set L to default (promised=2), mu_hat default ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and sigma_hat default (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples). This keeps the OR backend anchored to full-sample demand estimates and the promised lead time while avoiding premature adjustments for missing/undelivered shipments.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/2/18 (Period 2). Recent demand samples [231,255,302,272,272], mean=266.4. On-hand=0, in-transit=310 (order placed in Period 1). Promised lead time=2; no concluded arrivals yet so do not infer a lead-time change. Use default lead time and default demand statistics so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7sample mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std from full history. This keeps policy aligned with historical demand while allowing the in-transit 310 to be reconciled when/if it concludes.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent concluded arrival shows order placed in Period 1 arrived in Period 2 (observed lead_time=1). On-hand=0, in-transit=311 (Period 2 order) \u2014 no confirmed lost shipments. Use recent_N for L to reflect observed lead_time=1. Demand history mean (231,255,302,272,272)=266.4; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (all samples) scaled by (1+L) so backend will compute forecast and safety stock with L=1.

Carry-over insight: Observed lead_time=1 (Period 2 conclude: arrived=310 units ordered on Period 1, lead_time was 1 periods).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent concludes show actual lead time = 1 period (arrivals from Periods 1 and 2 each had W=1). On-hand=0, in-transit=374, demand history consistent with mean ~266.4. Set L to calculated average of observed lead times to reflect realized L=1. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample set, balancing service level against holding cost given profit=2 and holding=1.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/11 (Period 5). Recent history shows one concluded lead_time=1 (Period 2 conclude: order on P1 arrived in 1). On-hand=0, in-transit=706; recent demands: [231,255,302,272,272] (mean=266.4). Promised lead time=2 but observed arrivals indicate faster actual lead time (1). Use inferred average observed lead time to better match realized arrivals and avoid overstock. Choose L via calculate (avg observed lead times = 1). For demand forecast use default aggregation so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples, preserving full-sample stability given limited data. Use default sigma so backend scales historical volatility by sqrt(1+L). This balances service (avoid stockouts given observed shorter lead time and large in-transit) against holding cost.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). Recent realized lead times: Period2 conclude W=1, Period3 conclude W=1, Period5 conclude W=2 \u2192 variable but average \u22481.33. Historical demand samples mean=266.4 (samples=[231,255,302,272,272]). Current inventory: on-hand=122, in-transit=332 \u2192 total pipeline+on-hand=454, which is below (1+L)*mean demand (backend will compute). Choose L='calculate' to let backend use observed lead times average (captures the 1/1/2 pattern rather than blindly trusting promised 2). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level vs holding cost given modest sample size and recent lead-time variability. This approach is conservative to cover demand spikes while avoiding excess holding given holding cost=$1/unit and profit=$2/unit.

Carry-over insight: Observed lead times across concludes: 1, 1, 2 (Periods 2,3,5 concludes); recent average lead time \u22481.33 periods \u2014 lead time is variable and often below the promised 2.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019/3/25. On-hand=0, in-transit=568. Observed lead times = [1,1,2] (3 samples) \u2014 lead time is variable and often below promised 2. Recent demand (last 5 periods = 548,399,338,252,329) is higher than older seed samples, indicating an upward shift. Set L using recent_N (N=3) to reflect the observed variable/shorter lead time. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the recent higher mean and volatility across the (1+L) review+lead horizon so orders cover heightened demand while limiting holding cost exposure given zero on-hand and large in-transit.

Carry-over insight: Lead time regime shifted: observed lead_times {Period2:1, Period3:1, Period5:2} \u2192 recent average \u22481.33 (3 samples); Demand regime increased: recent 5-period mean=373.2 vs older sample mean lower.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. Recent demand has risen and become volatile (last demands: 399,338,252,329,415). On-hand=0, in-transit=814 (large pipeline). Observed lead times from concluded messages = {1,1,2} (Periods 2,3,5) => recent average \u22481.33. I set L to recent_N (N=3) to reflect the shorter, variable lead-time regime. For demand I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the elevated recent mean while excluding older low-demand samples. Sigma uses recent_N N=5 to reflect recent higher variance. These choices keep the backend's base-stock anchored to recent higher demand and variability while recognizing a shorter-than-promised lead time; with large in-transit stock this will avoid over-ordering from using the full promised L.

Carry-over insight: Lead time regime: recent observed lead_times {1,1,2} (Periods 2,3,5) => recent average \u22481.33 (N=3); Demand regime: recent 5-period mean elevated vs older history (evidence: recent demands 399,338,252,329,415).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). Recent concludes show variable but shortened lead times with recent observed leads = {2 (P5), 2 (P6), 1 (P7)} \u2192 recent average ~1.67; demand has stepped up recently (recent 5 demands 338,252,329,415,382; mean=343.2). On-hand=100 + in-transit=332=432 units; pipeline roughly covers ~1.25\u20131.3 periods at recent demand, so use recent-window estimates to capture elevated demand and variable lead time. Methods chosen: L by recent_N (N=3) to reflect current shorter/variable lead-time regime; mu_hat and sigma_hat by recent_N (N=5) to anchor forecasts on the last 5 demands and capture elevated mean/volatility. This biases ordering toward higher service with updated variability while not over-reacting to single-period spikes.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime shifted: recent observed lead_times (P5,P6,P7) = {2,2,1} \u2192 recent average \u22481.67 (N=3); Demand regime elevated: recent 5-period mean=343.2 vs older history lower.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15 (Period 10). Recent concluded lead times show variability but a recent regime of {2,2,1} (Periods 5,6,7 concludes) \u2192 avg \u22481.67; demand has risen recently (last 5 demands: 252,329,415,382,322; mean=340). On-hand=0, in-transit=624 so pipeline currently large. To balance higher recent demand and variable-but-shorter lead times, I set L to the recent average (N=3) and base demand forecast and volatility on the last 5 samples so the OR engine raises base-stock to cover the elevated regime while capping orders via its cap rule to avoid excess inventory given sizable in-transit stock.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22): on-hand=0, in-transit=719. Recent concluded lead times are variable (mix of 1s and 2s); use a short recent average to reflect current faster arrivals while allowing variability. Demand has shifted up recently: last 5 demands (periods 6-10) average elevated vs older history. Set L via recent_N (N=3) to capture the most recent lead-time regime. Set mu_hat via recent_N (N=5) to capture the elevated recent demand across the review+lead period. Set sigma_hat via recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent demand volatility. These choices keep orders responsive to the higher recent demand while the shorter L estimate reduces excessive pipeline built against an overestimated lead time.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29. Observed lead times from concludes = {1,1,2,2,1,2}; recent behaviour shows average >1 and variable. On-hand 0, in-transit 439 (pipeline present but lead_time uncertain). I choose L as recent_N (N=3) to reflect the most recent lead-time regime (captures recent variability without overreacting). Demand has been higher recently (last 5 periods mean ~371), so set mu_hat recent_N (N=5) to scale (1+L) by a recent mean. Volatility appears elevated recently; use sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent std. These settings bias orders toward meeting elevated near-term demand while keeping safety stock tuned to recent lead-time variability.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/6 (Period 13). On-hand=0, in-transit=775. Concluded history shows variable lead times (observed sequence 1,1,2,2,1,2 \u2192 avg=1.5; most recent three observed = {2,1,2} avg\u22481.67) and elevated recent demand (last 5 periods P8\u2013P12 demands = 382,322,308,427,438 \u2192 mean=375.4). To balance service vs holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1 (q=0.667 \u2192 higher target service level) I set L to the recent average regime (capture shorter-than-promised but variable lead time) using recent_N N=3. For demand forecast I use recent 5-period mean to capture the elevated regime (mu_hat recent_N N=5). I keep sigma_hat as default (use full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L)) so the OR backend retains conservative uncertainty estimates. These choices aim to raise target base-stock to meet higher demand while reflecting observed faster/variable arrivals and avoiding overcommitment beyond observed variance.

Carry-over insight: Lead time regime: observed lead_times [1,1,2,2,1,2] \u2192 mean 1.5 (6 samples); recent 3-sample avg = 1.67. Demand regime: recent 5-period mean (P8\u2013P12) = 375.4, elevated vs older history.

LLM Rationale:

Concluded lead-times show variability; recent observed concludes (Periods 2,3,5,6,7,9,11,12,13) imply mean \u22481.5 with recent 3\u20136-sample averages ~1.67. Demand regime is elevated (recent 5-period mean \u2248375). To account for faster-than-promised arrivals on average but variable lead time, set L using recent lead-time samples (captures shorter-than-promised behavior). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat from recent 5 demand observations to reflect the elevated demand and its volatility, so base-stock increases to protect service while sigma reflects recent variability.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20 (Period 15). On-hand=61, in-transit=467 => pipeline+on-hand=528. Recent concluded arrivals show variable lead times with a short-term average \u22481.67 (last 3 observed lead_times = {2,2,1}), so actual lead time is often below promised 2 but has frequent 2-period occurrences. Demand has been elevated recently; use recent-window estimates so the OR engine's base_stock and cap reflect the higher short-term mean and variance and adapt to variable lead times. Using recent_N for L (N=3) captures current lead-time regime; using recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat captures the elevated recent demand regime (5 most recent demands). This balances service (avoid stockouts given higher demand and variable L) against holding cost by letting the backend compute safety stock from these short-run statistics.

Carry-over insight: Lead time short-term mean \u22481.67 based on last 3 observed lead_times (2,2,1); recent demand elevated (5-period mean \u2248343.2).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27 (Period 16). On-hand=0, in-transit=676. Recent concluded lead-times show a short, variable regime; last 3 observed lead_times = {2,2,1} -> short-term avg \u22481.67. Demand has stepped up recently: recent 5-period demands (Periods 11\u201315) = [427,438,267,275,348], mean \u2248351, higher than older history. To protect availability given variable/shorter lead times and elevated demand, set L based on the recent 3 observed lead-times, set mu_hat from the recent 5-demand average across the review+lead period, and set sigma_hat from recent 5 samples to reflect current volatility. This balances higher service against holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time short-term mean \u22481.67 based on last 3 observed lead_times (Periods with observed LT = 2,2,1); recent demand elevated: Periods 11\u201315 mean \u2248351 (evidence: demands 427,438,267,275,348).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03 (Period 17). On-hand=0, in-transit=752. Historical concluded lead-times are variable; recent short-term average high-frequency signal uses the last 3 observed lead_times (2,2,1) \u2192 ~1.67. Demand has shifted up versus older history; recent 5-period demand is the best estimator of near-term demand. I set L to recent_N (N=3) to capture the current short-term lead-time regime. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the elevated recent demand and recent volatility, so the OR backend will target a higher base-stock while keeping pipeline cap reasonable given lead-time variability and potential lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time short-term regime: recent observed lead_times (most recent 3) = {2,2,1} \u2192 mean \u22481.67; Demand regime elevated: recent 5-period mean \u2248339.6 (Periods 12\u201316), higher than older history.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/10 (Period 18). On-hand=0, in-transit=676. Historical concluded lead_times are variable; the most recent 3 concluded lead_times average \u22481.67 (shorter than promised 2). Recent demand has been elevated vs older history; use a short recent window to reflect the current demand regime while keeping L responsive to observed quicker arrivals. I set L using recent_N (N=3) to capture current shorter-than-promised lead times. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to base the forecast on the latest five demand observations (captures recent elevated demand and variance). This balances service (raise target inventory for higher recent demand) while avoiding excessive holding by limiting the lookback.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time short-term regime: most recent 3 observed lead_times \u22481.67 (evidence: recent concludes showing mix of 2,2,1); Demand regime: recent 5-period demand elevated vs older history (use 5-period mean for forecasting).

LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). On-hand=0, in-transit=676. Recent concluded lead-times (most recent 3) = {2,2,1} => short-term mean \u22481.67; demand has been elevated recently (use recent 5-period mean for forecast). To balance service vs holding cost I use a short-term lead-time estimate (recent_N, N=3) and base demand on the last 5 periods to capture the current higher demand regime; volatility also from recent 5 samples to reflect current variability. This increases ordering to cover higher near-term demand while keeping cap limits enforced by OR backend.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time short-term regime: recent 3 observed lead_times = {2,2,1} \u2192 mean \u22481.67; Demand regime elevated: recent 5-period mean \u2248317 (Periods 14\u201318).

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). Recent demand elevated but variable: last 5 demands (Periods 15\u201319) = [348,370,297,294,334], 5-period mean \u2248 328.6. On-hand=0, in-transit=676 \u2014 substantial pipeline but arrivals have been intermittent. Observed recent lead_times (most recent 3 concluded) = {2,2,1} \u2192 short-term mean \u22481.67, so I use a recent_N lead-time estimate to capture the shorter-than-promised but variable lead-time. Use a recent 5-sample demand forecast (mu_hat) to reflect the elevated recent regime while keeping sigma default to let backend compute volatility across all samples. These choices keep target base-stock responsive to higher recent demand and shorter observed lead time while relying on backend volatility for safety.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time short-term mean \u22481.67 based on most recent observed lead_times {2,2,1} (N=3); Demand regime elevated: recent 5-period mean \u2248328.6 (Periods 15\u201319); Large pipeline outstanding (in-transit=676) with intermittent arrivals\u2014monitor for lost shipments.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-01 (Period 21). On-hand=0, in-transit=703. Historical concluded lead_times (most recent observed): {Period11:2, Period14:2, Period17:1} \u2192 short-term mean \u22481.67. Recent demand has been elevated but variable; last 5 demands (Periods16\u201320)=[370,297,294,334,289], mean=316.8. To balance service vs holding given intermittent arrivals and large pipeline, I set L to recent_N (N=3) to capture the short-term lead-time regime (\u22481.67). I set mu_hat to recent_N (N=5) so the backend forecasts using the most recent demand regime (covers review+lead). I keep sigma_hat as default to let backend use full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). This raises target base-stock to protect service against the observed elevated demands while avoiding excess hold when shipments are intermittent or lost.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time short-term regime \u22481.67 based on most recent observed lead_times (most recent 3 concludes: 2,2,1); recent demand regime elevated but variable (use recent 5-period mean). Large pipeline outstanding (in-transit=703) with intermittent arrivals \u2014 monitor for lost shipments.

Historical concludes show variable actual lead times; most recent 3 observed lead_times = {2,2,1} \u2192 short-term mean \u22481.67. Recent demand regime elevated but variable; use most recent 5 demands (Periods 17\u201321 = 297,294,334,289,317) to set forecast. To balance service vs holding cost: use L recent_N (N=3) to capture short-term lead-time regime; use mu_hat recent_N (N=5) to reflect current elevated demand; use sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to capture recent volatility. This keeps pipeline coverage aligned to recent lead-time behavior while avoiding overreaction to older low-demand periods.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/15 (Period 23). On-hand=0, in-transit=676 with intermittent past arrivals \u2014 monitor for lost shipments. Recent observed lead-times (concluded) show a shorter, variable regime; using a short-window estimate captures current variability. Demand has been elevated recently; use the last 5 demands to forecast (captures recent spike while limiting noise). Therefore: L estimated from most recent 3 observed lead-times (captures short-term shift ~1.67); mu_hat from recent 5 demands ((1+L)*mean of last 5 periods) to reflect current elevated demand; sigma_hat from recent 5 demands to capture recent volatility. These choices raise target base-stock to protect service given large pipeline and variable lead-time while keeping variability estimates grounded in recent data.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-22 (Period 24). On-hand=0, in-transit=676. Historical concludes show variable lead times; most recent observed lead_times (from concluded arrivals) = {2 (P22),1 (P17),2 (P14)} \u2192 short-term average \u22481.67 (use N=3). Demand regime elevated but variable; recent 5-period demands (P19\u2013P23) = [334,289,317,313,352], mean=321 \u2192 use recent_N N=5 to capture current demand. Sigma: use default population estimate scaled by sqrt(1+L). These settings raise the backend base-stock to cover the current elevated demand and variable but shorter-than-promised lead times while keeping volatility estimation standard so the capped order cap limits over-ordering given the large existing pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time short-term mean \u22481.67 based on most recent observed lead_times {2,1,2} (Periods 14,17,22); Recent demand regime: P19\u2013P23 mean=321 (elevated vs older history); Large pipeline outstanding in-transit=676 \u2014 monitor for lost shipments.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29 (Period 25). Recent demand regime elevated (recent 5-period mean ~328\u2013375 across P15\u2013P24) vs older history; on-hand=0, large pipeline=in-transit 685 with intermittent/late arrivals. Observed lead-times in concludes show short-term regime \u22481.67 (most recent 3 observed lead_times = {2,2,1}), so I use recent_N (N=3) for L to capture current faster-than-promised but variable lead-time. For demand I target the short recent regime using recent_N (N=5) to reflect elevated demand and smooth noise. Volatility I'll leave to backend default (uses all samples) to avoid overfitting given limited series. These choices aim to raise base-stock to meet higher short-term demand while accounting for variable but sub-promised lead-times and the large outstanding pipeline (monitor for lost shipments).

Carry-over insight: NEW: Large pipeline outstanding (in-transit=685 as of Period 25) with intermittent/late arrivals \u2014 risk of lost shipments; short-term lead-time regime \u22481.67 based on most recent 3 observed lead_times {2,2,1}.

Recent observed lead-times (most recent 3 concludes) = {2,2,1} \u2192 short-term mean \u22481.67; demand has been elevated but variable\u2014use most recent 5 periods for demand forecast. Choose L as recent_N (N=3) to reflect short-term observed lead-time regime. Use mu_hat recent_N (N=5) and sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) so the OR engine targets capacity for the latest demand regime while capturing recent volatility. This balances service (higher mu_hat for elevated demand) against holding cost, and acknowledges the large at-risk pipeline by relying on recent lead-time evidence rather than promised L=2.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/2 (Period 30). Demand has been elevated recently (recent 5-periods higher than older history) and observed lead times are variable but short-term ~1.67 based on most recent 3 concluded lead-times (2,2,1). Large pipeline outstanding (685 in-transit) with intermittent/late arrivals \u2014 risk of lost shipments. To balance service vs holding cost: set L to recent_N (N=3) to capture the short-term lead-time regime; set mu_hat to recent 5-period demand average to reflect the elevated demand regime; keep sigma_hat as default to let backend compute volatility from full history scaled for (1+L). This increases target base-stock to reduce stockouts while avoiding excessive explicit inventory inflation given existing large in-transit pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Large pipeline outstanding (in-transit\u2248685 as of Period 25) with intermittent/late arrivals \u2014 risk of lost shipments; short-term lead-time regime \u22481.67 based on most recent observed lead_times {2,2,1}.

LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). On-hand=0, in-transit=685 (large outstanding pipeline with intermittent/late arrivals). Recent observed lead-times show a short-term regime ~1.67 (most recent 3 observed LTs \u2248 {2,2,1}); demand has been variable but use the most recent 5 periods for forecasting (Periods 28\u201332 demands = 294,229,274,254,248 => mean\u2248259.8). To balance service vs holding given large pipeline and risk of lost shipments, set L using recent_N (N=3) to capture short-term lead-time regime; set mu_hat using recent 5-period mean (recent_N N=5) so orders reflect current demand level; keep sigma_hat default so backend uses full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). These choices reduce over-ordering from stale long-term means while accounting for the shorter observed lead time and current demand pattern.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:

Recent observed lead-time regime is short-term \u22481.67 (recent concludes mix 2,2,1) so I use recent_N for L with N=3 to capture current faster-than-promised but variable lead-time. Demand has been elevated/variable recently; I use recent 5-period demand to set mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine sizes orders to cover (1+L) periods of current demand and reflect recent volatility. These choices increase responsiveness to recent lead-time regime and demand while acknowledging the risky pipeline (monitor for lost shipments).

Carry-over insight: Large pipeline outstanding (in-transit\u2248685 as of Period 25) with intermittent/late arrivals \u2014 elevated risk of lost shipments (evidence: many periods with no arrivals after orders placed; in-transit stuck at ~685).

LLM Rationale:
2019-10-14 (Period 36). On-hand=0, in-transit=685 with many intermittent/late arrivals \u2192 elevated risk of lost shipments. Historical observed lead_times show short-term mean \u22481.67 based on most recent 3 concluded lead_times (2,2,1). Demand regime is elevated vs older history; use recent 5-period demand to capture current higher demand. Choices: L=recent_N N=3 to reflect short-term observed lead-time regime; mu_hat=recent_N N=5 to forecast using the most recent elevated demand regime across review+lead; sigma_hat=default to let backend scale volatility with chosen L. These settings bias orders upward to cover higher recent demand and variable/short but inconsistent lead times while acknowledging large in-transit risk.

Recent observed lead-times (most recent 3 concludes) = {2,2,1} \u2192 short-term mean \u22481.67, so use recent_N for L with N=3.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/10/28. On-hand=0, in-transit=685 with many periods of no arrivals \u2192 elevated risk of lost shipments. Recent observed lead_times (most recent 3 concludes) = {2,2,1} \u2192 short-term mean \u22481.67. Recent demand (last 5 observed demands P33\u2013P37 = 405,312,266,240,306) mean \u2248305.8, above the very old baseline. I set L to recent_N (N=3) to reflect the short-term lead-time regime so the OR engine orders for a shorter, empirically observed lead time; mu_hat uses recent_N (N=5) to capture the elevated recent demand pattern; sigma_hat left as default to let backend compute volatility from full history. This balances service (avoid stockouts given elevated demand) against holding cost while acknowledging the stuck pipeline\u2014monitor for lost shipments and adjust if arrivals remain absent.

Carry-over insight: Large pipeline outstanding (in-transit\u2248685 as of Period 25\u201338) with intermittent/late arrivals \u2014 elevated risk of lost shipments; short-term lead-time regime \u22481.67 based on most recent observed lead_times {2,2,1}.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/4 (Period 39). Demand regime remains elevated vs older history; recent 5-period demand is the best short-term anchor. Observed concluded lead-times are variable but short of promised 2; most recent 3 observed lead_times average \u22481.67. Large pipeline (in-transit\u2248685) with intermittent/late arrivals -> elevated risk of lost shipments; be conservative on lead-time estimate to avoid under-ordering. Chosen methods: L recent_N N=3 to capture short-term lead-time regime (~1.67); mu_hat recent_N N=5 to anchor forecast to the most recent demand regime; sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to reflect recent demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: NEW: Large pipeline outstanding (in-transit\u2248685 as of Period 25\u201338) with intermittent/late arrivals \u2014 elevated risk of lost shipments; short-term lead-time regime \u22481.67 based on most recent observed lead_times {2,2,1}.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=0, in-transit=685; recent demand elevated (last 5 samples) and lead times variable with short-term mean \u22481.67. Use recent 3-sample lead-time avg to capture current faster/variable regime; use recent 5-sample demand stats for mu and sigma to reflect elevated demand. This balances service (higher mu_hat for elevated demand) while keeping sigma_hat responsive to recent volatility; monitoring large in-transit suggests risk of lost shipments which favors using recent lead-time estimate rather than the promised 2.

Carry-over insight: Large pipeline outstanding (in-transit\u2248685 as of Period 25\u201339) with intermittent/late arrivals \u2014 elevated risk of lost shipments (evidence: many periods with no arrivals after orders placed; in-transit stuck \u2248685).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). On-hand=0, in-transit=685 (large, many periods without arrivals -> risk of lost shipments). Observed lead-time history shows short-term mean \u22481.67 using the most recent 3 concluded lead-times (mix of 2,2,1); recent demand (last 5 periods P36\u2013P40 = 240,306,276,241,252) mean \u2248263 and remains variable. I choose L recent_N N=3 to capture the short-term lead-time regime; mu_hat recent_N N=5 to base the replenishment target on the most recent demand level; sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to reflect recent demand volatility. These choices help the OR backend size orders for the current shorter/variable lead time and higher recent demand while reflecting recent variability; flagging the large stuck pipeline signals monitoring for lost shipments but the parameter choices use recent observations to avoid over-ordering against stale pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Large pipeline outstanding (in-transit\u2248685) with intermittent/late arrivals \u2014 elevated risk of lost shipments.

Recent observed lead-times (most recent 3 concluded) = {2,2,1} \u2192 short-term mean \u22481.67; demand has softened recently (most recent 5 concluded demands P37\u2013P41 = [306,276,241,252,210], mean=257). To balance service vs holding given risky pipeline, use a short-term lead-time estimate (recent behavior) and base demand forecast on the recent 5-period regime so OR backend orders to cover immediate demand while avoiding excessive extra inventory if in-transit fails to arrive.

Recent observed lead-time regime short-term \u22481.67 (most recent 3 observed lead_times = {2,2,1}), so use recent_N for L with N=3 to capture current lead-time mix. Recent demand has moderated: use recent 5-period mean (Periods 38\u201342) to set mu_hat (captures latest demand level). Use default sigma_hat so backend uses full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances service (shorter inferred L raises required pipeline coverage) against holding cost given large existing in-transit; using recent demand prevents over-ordering into an already large pipeline while acknowledging lead-time variability.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/9 (Period 44). Recent demand regime elevated vs older history (recent 5 demands higher); on-hand=0, large pipeline=685 with many periods of no arrivals \u2192 elevated risk of lost shipments/intermittent arrivals. Recent observed lead-times (most recent 3 concludes) = {2,2,1} \u2192 short-term mean \u22481.67. To be robust to elevated demand while acknowledging shorter but variable lead time and risky pipeline, I set L using the recent 3-sample lead-time average, set mu_hat using the recent 5 periods of demand to capture current elevated demand, and keep sigma_hat default to reflect full-sample volatility scaling. This balances service (higher mu_hat) against holding cost given high pipeline and possible lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Large pipeline outstanding (in-transit\u2248685) with intermittent/late arrivals \u2192 elevated risk of lost shipments (evidence: many periods with no arrivals after orders; pipeline stuck \u2248685).

LLM Rationale:
Date=2019/12/16 (Period 45). On-hand=0, in-transit=685 (large, intermittent arrivals \u2192 elevated risk of lost shipments). Observed lead-times have been variable; short-term mean of the most recent observed lead-times \u22481.67 (sequence {2,2,1}). Recent demand is variable; use the most recent 5 samples to capture current regime and volatility. Therefore set L by averaging the most recent 3 observed lead-times to reflect the short-term regime; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent 5-period demand to target service while limiting excess holding given high in-transit exposure.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date=2019-12-23 (Period 46). On-hand=0, in-transit=685 with many intermittent/late arrivals \u2192 elevated risk of lost shipments. Demand has been elevated and variable recently; use a short-term lead-time estimate based on most recent observed lead-times. Choices: L via recent_N (N=3) to capture the short-term regime (most recent observed lead_times \u22481.67); mu_hat via recent_N (N=5) to anchor forecast to the last 5 demand observations (captures recent elevated demand); sigma_hat use default to let backend scale volatility over (1+L). These parameters balance service (protect against stockouts given in-transit uncertainty) while avoiding excessive extra inventory given holding cost and risk of lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Large pipeline outstanding (in-transit=685) with intermittent/late arrivals \u2192 elevated risk of lost shipments (evidence: many periods with no arrivals after orders; pipeline stuck \u2248685).

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30 (Period 47). On-hand=0, in-transit=685 (large stuck pipeline with intermittent/late arrivals). Recent observed lead-times (most recent 3 concludes) average \u22481.67 \u2014 lead-time regime shorter than promised but variable, risk of lost shipments given long-standing in-transit buildup. Recent 5-period demand (Periods 42\u201346) mean = 232.2; use 5-period recent mean to capture current demand level. Choices: L -> recent_N (N=3) to reflect short-term observed lead-time ~1.67 so OR orders account for actual faster arrivals while remaining robust to variability; mu_hat -> recent_N (N=5) to forecast using latest demand regime; sigma_hat -> default to let backend compute volatility across all samples scaled by sqrt(1+L). These settings balance service (capture recent elevated/variable lead-time) against holding cost given large existing pipeline and zero on-hand.

Carry-over insight: Large pipeline outstanding (in-transit\u2248685 as of Period 25\u201346) with intermittent/late arrivals \u2192 elevated risk of lost shipments (evidence: many periods with no arrivals after orders placed; pipeline stuck \u2248685).
