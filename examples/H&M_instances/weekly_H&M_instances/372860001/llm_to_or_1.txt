Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11 (no special calendar events). Product: basic women's fine-knit trainer socks \u2014 stable demand. Historical demands = [231,255,302,272,272], mean \u2248266.4; no concluded arrivals observed so actual lead time unknown so use promised. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we need replenishment covering (1+L) periods; use default lead time and default demand/volatility estimates so OR backend applies its base-stock calculation conservatively.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Product: womens socks; past demand samples = [231,255,302,272,272] (mean=266.4). Period 1 conclude shows ordered=310 arrived=0 so no concluded arrivals yet \u2014 cannot infer actual lead time or mark shipments delivered/lost. On-hand=0, in-transit=310 which is well below expected (1+L) demand aggregate (sum of samples=1332). Use promised lead time and historical demand to let OR backend compute a base-stock that raises supply; choosing defaults avoids overfitting to a single missing arrival signal.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). On-hand=0, in-transit=621 (matches orders 310+311). No concluded arrivals yet beyond promised lead time, so no evidence actual lead time differs from promised L=4. Historical demand samples = [231,255,302,272,272] (mean ~266.4). I will use default lead time and default demand statistics so the OR backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std \u2014 conservative approach given no arrival confirmations and material pipeline already en route.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. SKU is seasonal basics (trainer socks) with no calendar spikes now. On-hand=0, in-transit=1108 which equals orders placed in Periods 1\u20133; no concluded arrivals yet so shipments are not yet overdue given promised L=4. Historical demand samples = [231,255,302,272,272]; no clear recent changepoint in demand mean/variance. Use promised lead time to keep OR engine aligned with contract, and default mu_hat/sigma_hat so backend uses all samples ((1+L) scaling) \u2014 conservative balanced approach given high in-transit volume and risk of lost shipments is not yet evidenced.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. Product: womens fine-knit trainer socks. Historical demands = [231,255,302,272,272], mean=266.4. No concluded arrivals yet for prior orders (Periods 1\u20134 all arrived=0) \u2014 cannot infer actual lead time; shipments may still be in-transit. On-hand=0, in-transit=1601 which exceeds (1+L)*mean demand (5*266.4\u22481332), so no urgent replenishment required. Use default lead time (promised 4) and default demand stats so backend computes base-stock from full-sample mean/SD; this avoids overreacting to unconfirmed late/lost shipments and balances service level vs holding cost.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 start: on-hand=58, in-transit=1398. Historical demands = [231,255,302,272,272] (mean\u2248266.4). Period 5 conclude shows arrival of 310 units ordered on Period 1 => observed lead_time=4. Several subsequent orders (Periods 2-4) remain in-transit with no conclude yet; no strong evidence of lead-time drift or demand regime change. I therefore set L by calculating the average of observed lead times (captures the confirmed 4-period lead time). For demand I use default aggregation ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and default volatility to let the OR engine compute base_stock and cap from full history. This balances service (confirmed 4-period lead time) against holding cost given substantial pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Observed lead_time=4 periods (Period 5 conclude: 310 units arrived that were ordered on Period 1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $618.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-03-25. Recent concluded arrivals show orders placed in Periods 1&2 arrived with lead_time=4, so actual lead time matches promised. On-hand=40 + in-transit=1301 provides large pipeline but demand has trended up recently (recent concluded demands: Periods 5-6 = 252, 329; earlier samples show elevated variability). To balance service level vs holding cost, keep L at default (use promised 4). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to bias forecasts toward the recent higher-demand regime while retaining some smoothing over available samples.

Carry-over insight: Observed lead_time=4 periods (Period 5 conclude: 310 units arrived ordered on Period 1; Period 6 conclude: 311 units arrived ordered on Period 2).

Daily Reward (R_t): $718.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-04-01. Recent conclude messages show consistent actual lead_time = 4 (Period5 & Period6 & Period7 arrivals all trace to orders placed 4 periods earlier). On-hand=112, in-transit=1370 (large pipeline). Demand recent series (Periods 3-7 concludes) shows higher and more variable demand than the small historical seed; to capture recent regime I use a recent_N demand estimate over the last 5 demand observations. L set to default (promised 4) because observed lead time matches promised. mu_hat uses recent_N with N=5 to reflect the higher recent mean demand across the review+lead window. sigma_hat uses default to let backend scale volatility from full sample std; this balances service level vs holding given large pipeline and moderate holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Observed actual lead_time = 4 periods (evidence: Period5 conclude: arrived 310 ordered P1; Period6 conclude: arrived 311 ordered P2; Period7 conclude: arrived 487 ordered P3).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08. Recent concluded arrivals show consistent actual lead_time=4 periods (Periods 5-8). On-hand=223, in-transit=1216 (healthy pipeline). Recent demand has shifted up \u2014 last 5 concluded demands (P4-P8) = [338,252,329,415,382], mean=343.2. To reflect sustained higher demand while respecting observed lead time, set L using observed average, and use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine sizes base-stock and safety stock to recent demand volatility. This keeps service high given large pipeline but avoids overstating long-term variance.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15 (Period 10). Recent conclude history shows consistent actual lead time = 4 periods (arrivals in Periods 5\u20139 correspond to orders in Periods 1\u20135). On-hand = 8, in-transit = 1446 \u2014 substantial pipeline stock exists from prior orders. Demand history (early samples and period concludes) shows stable weekly demand without a detected regime change. Given observed stable lead time matching the promised lead time and large pipeline, use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend applies its standard base-stock calculation; this avoids overreacting to pipeline volume while letting the engine cap orders appropriately to balance service level (profit $2 vs holding $1).

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22 (Period 11). On-hand=0, in-transit=1504. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=4 periods (arrivals from orders placed in P1..P6 concluded in P5..P10 with W=4). No clear demand regime shift; recent demands have been elevated but within historical variability. Use promised/default lead time so OR backend treats L=4. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples; this balances service level (profit>holding cost so q>0.5) against holding cost while leveraging full sample set. This keeps orders conservative given large in-transit stock and stable lead-time evidence.

Carry-over insight: Observed sustained actual lead_time = 4 periods; evidence: Period5 conclude (P1->arrived, W=4) through Period10 conclude (P6->arrived, W=4).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29. SKU is basic womens trainer socks; no special calendar events. Historical demand samples show mean \u2248266.4 units/week; recent concluded arrivals consistently indicate actual lead time = 4 periods. On-hand=129, in-transit=1161 \u2014 pipeline is large relative to demand (\u22485\xd7 mean), so maintain standard estimates and let OR cap control order size. I use promised/default lead time to match observed sustained L=4, and default demand/volatility calculations so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this avoids overreacting to normal variability while the pipeline clears.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). Item 372860001 (women's socks). Current inventory: on-hand=30, in-transit=1281. Historical conclude messages show consistent arrivals with lead_time=4 periods (orders placed P1->arrived P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8, P5->P9, P6->P10, P7->P11, P8->P12). No lost shipments signaled and pipeline is large relative to demand. I therefore use default methods so the OR backend uses promised lead time and full historical demand samples to compute base_stock and caps, keeping service high while letting the solver balance holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Sustained actual lead_time = 4 periods observed; evidence: Period5 conclude (P1->arrived, W=4) through Period12 conclude (P8->arrived, W=4).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13 (Period 14). No special calendar events apparent for basic women's socks. Historical concluded arrivals show a sustained actual lead time = 4 periods through Period 13; promised lead time = 4. On-hand=100, in-transit=1414 \u2014 pipeline is large relative to weekly demand, so no overdue shipments suspected. Demand seed (provided samples) is stable. To avoid overreacting to recent arrivals and to let OR backend use its standard estimates, I keep L at the promised value and use default demand/volatility calculations so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This keeps service level driven by profit/holding tradeoff without increasing holding risk given large pipeline.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27 (Period 16). SKU 372860001 (socks). On-hand=0, in-transit=1433. Historical concluded arrivals show a sustained actual lead time of 4 periods (arrivals for orders placed P1\u2192P11 all with W=4). Recent demand history (concluded periods) shows weekly demands ~250\u2013430; no clear regime shift. I therefore keep L at the promised/default to reflect observed stable lead time; use default demand scaling and default volatility so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full samples. This leverages the large in-transit pipeline (1433) to avoid over-ordering while the base-stock calculation balances profit (>$2) vs $1 holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Sustained actual lead_time = 4 periods observed through Period15 conclude: arrivals for orders placed P1..P11 all showed W=4.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/3 (Period 17). Inventory: on-hand=89, in-transit=1285. Historical concludes show sustained actual lead_time = 4 periods through Period 16, so stick with promised lead time. Historical sample mean (provided data) shows moderate demand; on-hand plus large pipeline covers several periods. Use default demand/volatility calculations so OR backend applies (1+L) scaling to sample mean/std\u2014this balances service level (high pipeline, profit>holding) against holding cost.

Current inventory: on-hand=262, in-transit=1193 \u2014 pipeline + on-hand (1455) comfortably covers a multi-period demand buffer.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-08 (Period 22). Demand context: stable weekly demand with past samples [231,255,302,272,272] and recent realized weekly demands in history; no major calendar spikes expected. Lead-time inference: concluded arrivals through Period 21 show consistent W=4 \u2014 actual lead time sustained at 4 periods. Inventory: on-hand=221, in-transit=1183, so pipeline + on-hand comfortably covers multiple weeks. Decision: use promised/default lead time to match observed sustained 4-period actual lead time; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend will compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from samples). This keeps OR engine aligned with observed demand and sustained lead time, balancing service (profit $2 vs holding $1) while avoiding aggressive extra stock accumulation.

Carry-over insight: Sustained actual lead_time = 4 periods observed through Period21 conclude (evidence: Period5 conclude P1->arrived W=4 through Period21 conclude P17->arrived W=4).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:

On-hand=127 and in-transit=1234 -> ample pipeline coverage. Use default lead time (promised 4) because concluded arrivals consistently show W=4. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history; this balances service level (high pipeline) against holding cost given large in-transit stock.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29. SKU 372860001 (women's socks). Profit $2 / unit, holding $1 /unit/period. On-hand=183, in-transit=1256 (total pipeline=1439) which comfortably covers several periods of demand. Historical conclude messages show sustained actual lead time = 4 periods (consistent P5..P24 concludes). Therefore use promised/default lead time so OR backend sees L=4. No clear recent demand regime shift; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (all-sample estimates) so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full history. This keeps the OR base-stock anchored to long-run mean while the high pipeline mitigates stockouts, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit/holding ratio (q\u22480.667).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). Historical concludes show a sustained actual lead time of 4 periods (consistent arrivals for orders placed P1..P21 with W=4). On-hand=206 and in-transit=1244 (ample pipeline). No overdue or missing shipments visible. Use promised/default lead time so backend uses L=4. Demand samples are stable; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (use full-sample mean and std scaled by (1+L)/sqrt(1+L) per backend). This balances service (high pipeline + observed steady LT) against holding cost without overreacting to noise.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). No special calendar event; product is basic socks with stable sales. Historical concludes show consistent actual lead_time = 4 periods (orders from P1..P22 all arrived with W=4) so promised lead time is reliable. On-hand 261 + in-transit 1175 gives ample coverage vs typical weekly demand; no evidence of lost shipments. Use default lead time to match promised/observed L=4. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from historical demand samples \u2014 this balances service-level (profit>holding cost) using the OR engine's base-stock formula while avoiding manual overstock given large pipeline.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19 (Period 28). SKU 372860001: on-hand=269, in-transit=1113. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead_time = 4 periods (sustained through Period 23 conclude). Pipeline (+on-hand) is large relative to typical weekly demand, so maintain conservative baseline parameters aligned with promised lead time. I choose default L (use promised lead time = 4) and default demand statistics so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7sample mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7sample std from historical demand samples; this avoids overreacting to short-term noise while letting the OR engine target the profit-driven service quantile.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26 (Period 29). Historical concludes show a sustained actual lead time of 4 periods (consistent from Period5 through Period28 concludes). On-hand=330, in-transit=1055 \u2014 pipeline is healthy. Demand history (seed samples) is limited but stable. I choose to trust the promised lead time and historical demand moments: use default lead time (promised L=4), default mu_hat to let OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples, and default sigma_hat so backend computes sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This keeps the OR engine calibrated to long-run demand while leveraging the observed stable L=4 and sizable pipeline to balance service level (profit > holding cost) against holding costs.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). Demand history shows stable weekly demand with no recent regime shift; concluded arrivals consistently indicate actual lead time = 4 periods. Current inventory: on-hand=368, in-transit=1077 \u2014 pipeline is healthy (covers multiple weeks). Choose L=default to use promised lead time (matches observed sustained L=4). Use mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full demand history; this leverages stable demand samples and the confirmed lead time to produce a base-stock that balances $2 profit vs $1 holding cost while capping order size for risk control.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-09 (Period 31). Historical concluded arrivals show a sustained actual lead time of 4 periods (consistent evidence through Period 30 conclude). On-hand = 338, in-transit = 1049 \u2014 pipeline is large relative to on-hand, no overdue/lost shipments visible. Demand history shows moderate weekly demand (see past samples); profit $2 / holding $1 implies target service quantile q=2/(2+1)=0.666.. so OR will set a moderately elevated base stock. I choose to trust the promised lead time and use default demand estimates so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility from full sample history; this avoids overreacting to recent variability while pipeline is healthy.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-16 (Period 32). Product is slow/steady apparel (trainer socks). Historic concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead_time = 4 periods through Period 31 conclude; no lost shipments observed. Inventory strong: on-hand=331, in-transit=1069 \u2014 pipeline + on-hand well above short-term demand. Use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend uses promised L and full-sample statistics; this keeps policy aligned with observed stable lead time and avoids overfitting to recent noise while letting the OR cap limit order size to control holding costs.

LLM Rationale:

Historical conclude messages show a sustained actual lead time of 4 periods through Period32 conclude (orders P1..P27 all arrived with W=4). Demand history appears stable. Given confirmed L=4 and modest profit/holding (profit=$2, holding=$1) I keep the backend's default calculations so the optimizer balances service level vs holding cost using (promised) L=4 and historical demand stats.

Demand history provided (seed samples) is limited and shows no recent regime shift. I therefore use the promised/default lead time (L=4) and default demand/volatility calculations so the OR backend applies (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std across all samples; this keeps the base-stock grounded in the full-sample statistics while the observed sustained L=4 ensures timing alignment with arrivals.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-07 (Period 35). Demand history shows stable weekly sales with no recent regime shift; concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead_time = promised 4 periods across many periods. On-hand = 168 and in-transit = 1168 (pipeline large relative to weekly demand), so no immediate shortage risk. I choose L=default to trust the sustained observed lead time of 4; mu_hat=sigma_hat default to let the OR engine compute (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std from the demand samples \u2014 this balances service level vs holding cost given stable demand and large pipeline.

On-hand=169, in-transit=1212 \u2014 pipeline ample but arrivals are observed with 4-period lag. Use promised/default lead time and default demand estimates so OR backend uses full sample history to compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std; this balances service (reasonable pipeline) against holding cost given high in-transit stock.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21 (Period 37). Historical conclude messages show a sustained actual lead time of 4 periods (orders placed P1..P32 all concluded with W=4). On-hand=174 and in-transit=1226 \u2014 pipeline + on-hand is large and covers (L+1)=5 periods of typical demand, so no emergency replenishment needed. I therefore keep L at the promised/default (4) supported by extensive conclude evidence. Demand history shows stable weekly demand around mid-200s\u2013300s; no recent regime shift detected, so use default population estimates for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend applies its standard base-stock calculation and the capped order cap appropriately. This balances service-level (profit > holding cost => moderate fill target) against holding cost given the already-large pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Sustained actual lead_time = 4 periods; evidence: conclude messages Period5 through Period36 (orders P1..P32 arrivals all show W=4).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). Historical conclude messages show a sustained actual lead time of 4 periods (arrivals for orders P1..P33 all W=4). Current inventory: on-hand=107, in-transit=1218 \u2014 pipeline is large relative to demand, so no urgent replenishment risk. Use promised/default lead time so backend aligns with observed W=4. Use default demand sizing and default volatility (use all historical samples) because there is no recent regime change in demand pattern that needs immediate adjustment and ample pipeline reduces stockout risk. These defaults favor the OR engine's base-stock calculation while avoiding overfitting to short-term noise and limiting holding cost exposure given holding cost=$1/unit/period vs profit=$2/unit.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). On-hand=248, in-transit=1106 \u2192 ample pipeline (total 1,354) given observed demand. Historical concluded messages show a sustained actual lead time of 4 periods (no sign of lost shipments). Demand history is stable without a recent structural shift. Use promised/default lead time so OR backend retains L=4; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history, providing a balanced service-level vs holding-cost tradeoff.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/11 (Period 40). On-hand=318, in-transit=1066. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead_time = 4 periods for arrivals through Period 39 conclude (orders placed P1..P35). No overdue or lost shipments signaled. Demand history shows stable weekly sales; given confirmed LT=4 and stable demand, use promised/default estimators so OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample set. This balances service (use observed L) vs holding cost by letting the backend set safety stock from full-sample stats.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/18. Historical demand stable around ~266 units/week; observed lead time has been consistently 4 periods in concluded history. Current on-hand (325) + in-transit (1040) = 1365 units, which roughly covers (1+L)=5 periods of demand (5 * mean \u2248 1,332), so no urgent deviation. Use promised/default lead time so OR backend retains L=4; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history, balancing service level vs holding cost given steady demand and ample pipeline.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/25 (Period 42). History shows sustained actual lead_time = 4 periods across many concluded periods (consistent W=4). On-hand=346 + in-transit=1054 provides ample coverage. Demand history is stable; no recent changepoint detected. I therefore use default lead time (promised=4) and default demand moments so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples; this keeps policy aligned with observed steady LT and stable demand while avoiding overfitting to short-term noise.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/02 (Period 43). Product: womens trainer socks; modest profit ($2) vs holding ($1). On-hand=297, in-transit=949 \u2014 large pipeline relative to recent weekly demand. Historical conclude messages show sustained actual lead time = 4 periods (consistent from Period5 through Period42 concludes). No strong recent demand upward trend that requires aggressive topping-up; pipeline already ample. I therefore use the default promised lead time and default demand moments so the OR backend computes base stock from the full historical sample, avoiding excess ordering given high in-transit stock.

Carry-over insight: Sustained actual lead_time = 4 periods (evidence: Period5 conclude through Period42 conclude show orders arriving with W=4).

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/9 (Period 44). Historical conclude messages show consistent actual lead time = 4 periods (orders placed P1..P39 arrived with W=4). On-hand=425, in-transit=1037 \u2014 ample pipeline coverage. No clear sustained regime shift in demand mean/variance; recent week dips appear transient (e.g. Period 43 demand=143). To keep the OR engine aligned with promised lead time and stable historical demand statistics, use default lead time and default demand mean/volatility (lets backend compute base-stock from full-sample stats). This keeps service level high given large pipeline while avoiding ad-hoc forecasts before stronger evidence of demand change.

Carry-over insight: Sustained actual lead_time = 4 periods observed through Period 43 conclude (orders P1..P39 arrivals all show W=4).

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16 (Period 45). Historical demand samples show mean=266.4 (samples [231,255,302,272,272]). Concluded messages through Period 44 consistently show actual lead_time=4 periods (sustained). On-hand 449 + in-transit 933 = 1,382 units which covers the (1+L)=5 period expected demand \u22481,332 units (5\xd7266.4). Therefore use default promised lead time and default demand/volatility aggregation so the OR backend uses full-sample statistics; current pipeline is sufficient to meet short-term demand while minimizing extra holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Sustained actual lead_time = 4 periods observed through Period 44 conclude (arrivals for orders P1..P39 showed W=4).

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23. Historical conclude messages show sustained actual lead time = 4 periods (consistent with promised L=4). Current inventory: on-hand 463 + in-transit 888 = 1351 units, which comfortably covers (1+L)=5 periods at recent demand rates. I choose L=default to trust the promised lead time given consistent evidence. I use mu_hat recent_N with N=5 to bias the forecast toward the most recent demand pattern (capturing late-Nov/Dec softness) while keeping responsiveness. I keep sigma_hat=default to use full-sample volatility for stability. These settings balance service (avoid stockouts via recent demand focus) against holding cost (use pipeline stock and recent mean to avoid over-ordering).

Observed conclude messages consistently show actual lead_time = 4 periods for many periods (no evidence of lost shipments or drift). Current on-hand=439 and in-transit=688 provide healthy coverage. Use promised/default lead time and default demand/volatility aggregation so the OR backend computes base-stock from full-sample mean and std over (1+L) review+lead window; this balances service (high on-hand + in-transit) against holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1.
