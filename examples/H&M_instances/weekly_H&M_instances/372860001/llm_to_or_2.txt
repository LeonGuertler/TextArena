Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11, no special calendar event for basic cotton trainer socks; on-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must restock to cover typical demand. No evidence of demand or lead-time regime change in history. Use default methods with promised lead time (L=0). Historical mean demand = 266.4 units; use mu_hat = (1+L)*mean = 266.4. Historical std (population) \u2248 23.292, so sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std \u2248 23.292. These parameters give the OR backend a base-stock that balances the $2 profit vs $1 holding cost (q = 2/(2+1) = 0.666...), targeting a service level while keeping holding exposure moderate.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). Last period's order (Period 1) arrived with lead_time=0 and was fully sold (ending on-hand=0). Current on-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish. Historical demands = [231,255,302,272,272], mean=266.4, sample std\u224823.29. No calendar spikes apparent in mid-February for basic trainer socks. Use observed lead time=0 (consistent with Period 1 conclude) and default demand estimates to let the OR backend compute base stock balancing $2 profit vs $1 holding cost (q=0.667 => higher service target).

Carry-over insight: Observed lead time = 0 periods (Period 1 conclude: arrived=278, ordered Period 1, lead_time 0); recent demand mean \u2248266.4, std \u224823.29.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Observed concluded lead times in Periods 1\u20132 are 0; use calculated L=0. Demand shows a recent upward shift (Period 2 demand=548 vs prior history), so I use a recent_N demand estimate with N=3 (last 3 demands: 272, 287, 548) to capture the new regime. mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_recent = 369.0 units. sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std_recent = 155.229 (sample std of the 3-point window). These settings keep promised lead time, react to the demand spike to avoid stockouts, and accept higher safety stock given profit/holding tradeoff (profit=$2, holding=$1).

Carry-over insight: New demand regime detected: recent high demand spike (Period 2 demand=548) increases recent mean to 369.0 over last 3 periods (272,287,548); retain observed lead_time=0 evidence.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent concludes show fast arrivals (Periods 1-3 all arrived; observed lead_time=0). Demand spiked in Period 2 and remained high in Period 3; recent 3-period mean is materially above the long-run mean, so I use a recent-window forecast to capture the new high-demand regime. I set L by averaging observed lead times (calculate) => 0. I set mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to bias base-stock toward current elevated demand: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last 3 demands) = 411.333. I set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=3) population std scaled by sqrt(1+L) = 106.909. These parameters raise target stock to protect service during the higher-demand regime while recognizing lead_time=0 (keeps holding costs from inflating unnecessarily).

Carry-over insight: New high-demand regime beginning Period 2: recent 3-period mean demand = 411.33 (Periods 1-3 demands: 287, 548, 399); observed lead_time = 0 (Periods 1-3 arrivals all showed lead_time 0).

Daily Reward (R_t): $546.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent concluded periods show arrivals for Orders placed in Periods 1-4 with lead_time=0 consistently. Demand has shifted to a higher regime starting Period 2 (demands in Periods 2-4 = 548, 399, 338) so I use a recent-3 estimate for demand. Set L to promised (default) = 0 given consistent evidence. mu_hat uses recent_N=3 to capture the new higher mean demand over the review+lead window: mean(548,399,338)=428.33. sigma_hat uses recent_N=3 sample std to reflect increased volatility: std(sample)=108.03. These parameters increase the base-stock to raise service level during the sustained higher-demand regime while keeping holding costs tied to observed variance.

Carry-over insight: Observed lead_time=0 confirmed (arrivals on Periods 1-4 all show lead_time 0); New high-demand regime from Period 2 onward \u2014 recent 3-period mean demand (Periods 2-4) = 428.33, sample std = 108.03.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). On-hand=223, in-transit=0. Historical concl: arrivals in Periods 1\u20135 all show lead_time=0 \u2014 treat L=0. Recent demand has softened since the spike: last 3 realized demands (Periods 3\u20135) = [399, 338, 252], mean=329.6667, std\u224860.331. I use recent_N=3 to capture the current regime (decline after spike) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect near-term demand for the (1+L) review+lead window. This keeps base stock responsive to the recent downward move (reducing holding cost) while L=0 preserves fast replenishment evidence and service.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25. On-hand=33, in-transit=0; recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime starting Period 2 (demands: 548,399,338,252,329). All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0. I set L by averaging observed lead times (all zeros) -> L=0. For demand I detect the changepoint at Period 2 and use recent_N with N=5 (regime length=5) to capture the new higher mean. mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last 5 demands) = 373.2 units to raise the base-stock target; sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(last 5 demands) = 110.78 to reflect increased volatility. This increases order quantity to improve service (profit > holding cost) while the OR engine's cap still limits extreme orders.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime from Period 2 onward; last 5-period mean demand=373.2, std=110.78; observed lead_time=0 confirmed (arrivals Periods 1-6 all lead_time 0).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. Concluded arrivals through Period 7 confirm actual lead_time = 0 (all concluded arrivals show lead_time 0). Demand has been in a sustained high regime since Period 2; last 5-period mean = 373.2 and std = 110.78 (Periods 3-7 demands: 399,338,252,329,415 produce the cited statistics consistent with earlier carry-overs). To meet service targets while controlling holding cost, I use a lead time estimate averaged from observed concludes (calculate \u2192 0) and set demand forecast and volatility from the recent 5-period regime (recent_N) so the OR engine's base-stock and cap reflect current elevated demand.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. All concluded arrivals through Period 8 show lead_time=0 (many identical confirms), so set L=0. Recent demand remains in a higher regime since Period 2; I use the most recent 5-period demand (Periods 4-8 demands = 338,252,329,415,382) to forecast the next review+lead demand. Recent-5 mean = 343.2 \u2192 mu_hat; recent-5 sample std = 61.66 \u2192 sigma_hat. These choices keep base-stock responsive to the sustained high-demand regime while L=0 minimizes pipeline overhang given confirmed same-period arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime from Period 2 onward (evidence: recent 5-period mean demand=343.2, std=61.66); observed lead_time=0 confirmed by concluded arrivals through Period 8.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15 Period 10. On-hand=48, in-transit=0. Concluded arrivals through Period 9 consistently show lead_time=0, so use promised/default L=0. Demand has shifted to a sustained higher regime since Period 2; recent 5-period mean (Periods 5-9) = 343.2 and std = 61.66 \u2014 use recent_N=5 to capture current regime. mu_hat set to (1+L)*mean_recent = 343.2 to target service under current high demand; sigma_hat set to sqrt(1+L)*std_recent = 61.66 to reflect observed volatility. These parameters keep base-stock high enough for service while reflecting measured variability; with L=0 no pipeline correction needed beyond on-hand.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime from Period 2 onward (evidence: recent 5-period mean demand=343.2, std=61.66 through Period 9); observed lead_time=0 confirmed by concluded arrivals through Period 9.

Date 2019-04-22. Concluded history shows consistent actual lead_time=0 (all concluded arrivals through Period 10 had lead_time 0). Demand has been in a sustained high regime since Period 2; recent 5-period mean demand = 343.2, std = 61.66 (carry-over). Current inventory: on-hand=59, in-transit=0 \u2014 far below expected one-period demand. Set lead time L=0 (use observed actual), forecast demand using recent 5-period mean to reflect the sustained high-demand regime, and use the recent sample std for safety. This raises base-stock to service next period demand while keeping holding cost considered (profit=2, holding=1 implies moderate service quantile).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). All concluded arrivals through Period 11 show lead_time=0. Recent data shows a sustained high-demand regime from Period 2 onward; last 5 concluded demands (Periods 7-11 = 415,382,322,308,427) give mean=370.8 and std\u224853.76. With promised L=0 and confirmed actual L=0, I set L via recent observed lead times. I set mu_hat using recent_5 to capture the sustained higher demand and avoid understocking; sigma_hat uses recent_5 sample std to reflect current volatility. These parameters raise target base-stock to service the higher regime while keeping holding risk explicit to the OR engine (profit $2, holding $1 implies moderate service-level).

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime from Period 2 onward confirmed by recent 5-period mean demand=370.8 (Periods 7-11: 415,382,322,308,427); observed lead_time=0 confirmed by concluded arrivals through Period 11.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Observed concluded arrivals through Period 12 show actual lead_time = 0 consistently. Recent demand remains in a sustained high-demand regime; last 5 realized demands (Periods 8-12 = 382,322,308,427,438) have mean 375.4 and sample std \u224859.21. With promised L=0 and no in-transit/on-hand stock, use a 1-period forecast based on the most recent 5 periods to capture the elevated demand while limiting sensitivity to single spikes.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime from Period 2 onward confirmed (evidence: recent 5-period mean 375.4 for Periods 8-12); observed lead_time = 0 confirmed by concluded arrivals through Period 12.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13. Historical concludes through Period 13 confirm actual lead_time=0 and a sustained high-demand regime from Period 2 onward. Recent 5-period demands (Periods 9-13: 322,308,427,438,267) give mean=352.4 and std\u224875.97. I set L to the promised/default (0) since concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time 0. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand regime and recent volatility; mu_hat=(1+L)*mean=352.4, sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std=75.97. These parameters raise the base-stock to meet elevated demand while sigma captures recent variability so the OR backend balances service level versus holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime from Period 2 onward confirmed through Period 13 (evidence: recent 5-period mean demand Periods 9-13 = 352.4, std=75.97); observed lead_time = 0 confirmed by concluded arrivals through Period 13.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20 Period 15. On-hand=111, in-transit=0. Concluded arrivals through Period 14 consistently show lead_time=0; recent demand has been in a sustained higher regime. I set L to observed lead time (0) to align OR with realized shipments. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 concluded demand samples (Periods 10-14 = 308,427,438,267,275) to capture the current high-demand regime; mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(5)=343.0 units (covers review+lead period). sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*sample_std(5)=83.24 to reflect observed volatility. These parameters raise the base-stock to meet elevated demand while holding cost remains moderate (profit $2 vs holding $1), balancing service and inventory cost.

Carry-over insight: Observed lead_time=0 confirmed through Period 14 arrivals; sustained high-demand regime from Period 2 onward \u2014 recent 5-period mean demand (Periods 10-14) = 343.0, sample std = 83.24.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/27. On-hand=31, in-transit=0. Concluded history through Period 15 consistently shows actual lead_time=0 (all concluded arrivals had lead_time 0). Demand has been in a sustained higher regime; I use the most recent 5 observed demands (Periods 11-15: 427,438,267,275,348) to forecast the review+lead demand. Set L to promised (default=0) because concluded arrivals confirm 0 lead time. Set mu_hat using recent_5 mean = 351 units (1+L times mean). Set sigma_hat using recent_5 sample std \u2248 80.95 to reflect current volatility. These parameters raise the base-stock to cover elevated recent demand while using observed low lead time to avoid extra pipeline, balancing service level (profit > holding cost favors higher fill) against holding cost risk.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:

Recent demand (Periods 12-16: 438,267,275,348,370) shows a sustained higher-regime; I use the most recent 5 periods to capture current demand level while keeping responsiveness high. Set L based on observed lead times (calculate -> 0). Forecast mu_hat as (1+L)*recent-5 mean = 339.6 to target service for immediate-period demand. Sigma_hat as sqrt(1+L)*recent-5 sample std = 70.94 to reflect observed volatility; these parameters raise the base-stock to meet high short-term demand while the moderate sigma avoids excessive safety stock and holding cost.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10 (Period 18). On-hand=74, in-transit=0. Concluded arrivals through Period 17 consistently show lead_time=0; use promised/default L=0.

I set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the current regime (forecast demand over review+lead = 1\xd7mean). sigma_hat uses recent_N=5 (sqrt(1+L)\xd7sample std) to reflect current volatility. These parameters keep base-stock aligned with recent realized demand while avoiding excess holding given moderate on-hand inventory.

I set L to promised 0 (confirmed by concluded arrivals). I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to adapt to the more recent downshift while still capturing variability. mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_recent = 316.8 units to target service for the next period; sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*sample_std_recent = 40.2 to reflect observed volatility.

Demand has been in a sustained higher regime since Period 2; to capture recent behavior I use the last 5 observed demands (Periods 15-19 = 348,370,297,294,334) giving mean=328.6 and sample std\u224832.85. With L=0, set mu_hat=(1+L)*recent_mean to target one-period demand and sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*recent_std to reflect observed volatility.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/8 (Period 22). On-hand=15, in-transit=0; no arrivals pending or overdue. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=0. Recent demand has moderated relative to earlier spikes. I choose L=default (promised 0) because concluded history confirms same-period arrivals. For demand I use recent_N (N=5, Periods 17-21 demands 297,294,334,289,317) to capture the current regime: mean=306.2 and sample std=18.84. Using recent stats keeps base-stock responsive to the current (slightly lower) demand while avoiding overreacting to earlier spikes, balancing profit vs holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Observed lead_time=0 confirmed through Period 21 concluded arrivals; new recent 5-period mean demand (Periods 17-21) = 306.2, std = 18.84.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/15 (Period 23). Historical concluded arrivals through Period 22 consistently show actual lead_time = 0. Demand has been in a sustained higher regime since Period 2; recent 5-period demands (Periods 18-22 = [294,334,289,317,313]) give mean 309.4 and sample std \u224818.23. I set L based on observed lead times (calculate average of concluded lead_times = 0). I set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the sustained high-demand regime and avoid dilution by older low-demand samples: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_last5 = 309.4. I set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) as well: sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*sample_std_last5 = 18.23. These parameters keep the OR backend focused on the current high-demand level while recognizing the very low lead time, balancing service (higher base stock) against holding cost given holding=$1 and profit=$2 (service quantile q = 0.666...).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals through Period 23 consistently show lead_time=0, so use observed lead time=0. Recent demand has settled above early-season lows; last 5 realized demands (Periods 19-23 = 334,289,317,313,352) give mean=321.0 and sample std\u224823.63. I set L via recent observed lead times (average=0) and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the current high-demand regime while avoiding older low-demand samples. These parameters raise the backend base-stock to match current demand while keeping volatility estimate modest to limit excess holding given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-07-29. On-hand=55, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals through Period 24 confirm actual lead_time=0 (all concluded arrivals show lead_time 0). Recent demand has softened versus earlier high spike regime; last 5 realized demands (Periods 20-24 = 289,317,313,352,277) give mean\u2248309.6 and low dispersion. Set L by averaging observed lead times (calculate) \u2192 0 to reflect confirmed same-period arrivals. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the recent regime (most relevant for forecast and volatility). These parameters (mu_hat \u2248 309.6, sigma_hat \u2248 28.95) steer the OR engine's base-stock toward serving ~310 units of (review+lead) demand while keeping safety-stock modest given low std, balancing service (profit $2) against holding cost ($1).

Carry-over insight: Observed lead_time=0 confirmed through Period 24 concluded arrivals; recent 5-period mean demand (Periods 20-24)=309.6, std=28.95.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). On-hand=67, in-transit=0. Concluded arrivals through Period 25 consistently show lead_time=0, so use promised/default L=0. Demand has settled lower recently vs earlier high regime; I use a recent_N = 5 estimate (Periods 21-25 demands = 317,313,318,277,256) to capture the recent downshift. This gives (1+L) * mean = 296.2 units for mu_hat and sample std scaled by sqrt(1+L) = 28.18 for sigma_hat. These parameters keep the base stock responsive to the recent lower demand while the zero lead time evidence allows same-period replenishment to limit stockouts and avoid excess holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Observed lead_time=0 confirmed through Period 25 concluded arrivals; recent demand downshift (Periods 21-25 mean=296.2, std=28.18).

Daily Reward (R_t): $454.00

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). All concluded arrivals through Period 26 show lead_time=0 (no late/lost shipments). Demand has downshifted recently vs earlier high regime; Periods 21-25 mean=296.2, std=28.18 (carry-over). On-hand=62, in-transit=0 so we must cover current period demand plus maintain safety. I set L based on observed lead times (calculate average of concluded lead times = 0). For demand I use a recent_N forecast to capture the detected downshift: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean of last 5 demands (Periods 21-25) = 296.2. Volatility uses recent_N std scaled by sqrt(1+L): sigma_hat = 28.18. These choices keep target base-stock aligned to the newer lower-demand regime (reducing excess holding) while keeping service given L=0 and limited on-hand inventory.

Carry-over insight: Recent demand downshift confirmed: Periods 21-25 mean=296.2, std=28.18; observed lead_time=0 confirmed through Period 26.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Observed concluded arrivals through Period 27 confirm actual lead_time=0.

With L=0 I set mu_hat and sigma_hat from this recent 5-period regime so the OR engine targets service for the current lower-demand regime while avoiding excess holding cost given on-hand=8 and no in-transit.

Carry-over insight: Recent demand downshift confirmed: Periods 23-27 mean=288.8, std\u224839.7; observed lead_time=0 confirmed through Period 27 arrivals.

Observed lead_time=0 confirmed by concluded arrivals through Period 28. On-hand=12, in-transit=0 \u2014 risk of stockout this period. Recent demand shows a sustained downshift; I use recent_N=5 (Periods 24-28 demands) to keep forecasts responsive. Set L=default/promised (0). Set mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_recent5 = 277.2 to target service with current lower demand. Set sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*sample_std_recent5 = 20.413 to reflect observed volatility and let the backend compute base stock given profit/holding.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-09. All concluded arrivals through Period 30 show lead_time=0 (consistent); on-hand=7, in-transit=0 so stock is very low. Recent 5-period demand (Periods 26-30 = 258,301,294,229,274) shows a lower-demand regime vs earlier spikes. I set L to promised (0) because concluded history consistently confirms 0. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the recent downshift: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_recent = 271.2 units; sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std_recent = 29.02 units. This tightens safety stock to avoid excessive holding cost while preserving service for the current lower-demand regime.

For demand I use recent_N (N=5, Periods 27-31 demands = [301,294,229,274,254], mean=270.4) to capture the sustained lower regime; mu_hat = (1+L)*mean = 270.4. Volatility estimated from the same 5-sample window (sample std \u224829.55) => sigma_hat=29.55. These settings reduce target base-stock to align orders with the recent lower demand while keeping same-period lead-time assumption to avoid unnecessary pipeline. This balances service (by using short-term mean) against holding cost (lower mu_hat and moderate sigma).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-23. On-hand=36, in-transit=0 \u2014 low cover. All concluded arrivals through Period 32 show lead_time=0, so use promised lead time L=0. Recent demand has downshift; use last 5 observed demands (Periods 28-32: 294,229,274,254,248) to capture current regime. Forecast (1+L)*mean = 259.8 units; sample std scaled by sqrt(1+L) = 24.96. These parameters target the recent lower-demand regime while keeping service with minimal holding cost given low on-hand and no pipeline.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-30. No special calendar events; product is basic trainer socks. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Concluded arrivals through Period 33 show consistent lead_time=0 (orders from Periods 1\u201333 all arrived same period). Recent demand shows a spike in Period 33 (405) but the most relevant short-run average is the last 5 demands (Periods 29\u201333 = [229,274,254,248,405]) with mean=282.0 and sample std\u224870.63. I set L to promised/observed 0 to reflect reliable same-period delivery. I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to adapt quickly to the recent regime including the spike; mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_recent = 282.0. sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std_recent = 70.629. These parameters give the OR backend a short-horizon forecast that balances service (captures recent spike) against holding cost given zero lead time and no pipeline.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/10/07 (Period 35). On-hand=1, in-transit=0 -> urgent replenishment risk. Concluded history through Period 34 shows all arrivals had lead_time=0 (consistent, use observed lead_time=0). Recent demand volatility: last 5 demands (Periods 30-34 = 274,254,248,405,312) capture a small downshift then two larger weeks; I use recent_N=5 to reflect the latest regime. With L=0, mu_hat = 1*mean(last5)=298.6 units (covers review+lead). Recent sample std(last5)=64.53 -> sigma_hat = 64.53 (scaled by sqrt(1+L)=1). These settings keep the backend's base-stock responsive to the latest demand level while relying on confirmed same-period deliveries to avoid extra pipeline. Low on-hand motivates ordering to raise on-hand toward the computed base stock.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-14 (Period 36). All concluded arrivals through Period 35 show lead_time=0 (no evidence of delays or losses). Recent demand shows a modest downshift vs earlier high-regime; last 5 observed demands (Periods 31-35 = 254,248,405,312,266) give mean=297.0 and sample std\u224865.37. On-hand=61, in-transit=0 so we need ~1 period of coverage (L+1). I set L based on concluded lead-time history (calculate \u2192 0). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent 5-period regime (recent_N=5) so the OR engine targets service consistent with current demand while avoiding excess holding cost given the lower recent mean.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Concluded arrivals through Period 36 all show lead_time=0 so use L=0. Recent demand regime best represented by the last 5 periods (Periods 32-36) where demand = [248,405,312,266,240]; recent 5-period mean=294.2 and sample std\u224867.94. Use recent_N=5 to capture the latest demand level/volatility and keep (1+L) factor (L=0). These parameters keep base-stock responsive to current demand while holding cost remains moderate (profit=2, holding=1 implies service-focused q).

Carry-over insight: Observed lead_time=0 confirmed through Period 36 concluded arrivals; recent 5-period demand (Periods 32-36) mean=294.2, sample std\u224867.94.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). Historical concluded arrivals through Period 37 confirm actual lead time = 0 (all concluded arrivals show lead_time 0). Recent demand shows a moderate level around ~306 units/week (Periods 33-37 demands = 405,312,266,240,306; mean=305.8, sample std\u224862.84). On-hand = 18, in-transit = 0 so we must order for current period demand plus safety. I set L using observed lead times (calculate) = 0. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the recent 5-period regime (recent_N) to capture the current demand level and volatility so the OR backend's base-stock and cap reflect the recent downshift from earlier spikes while keeping service given zero lead time.

Carry-over insight: Observed lead_time=0 confirmed through Period 37 concluded arrivals; new recent 5-period demand regime (Periods 33-37) mean=305.8, std\u224862.84.

To keep service but limit holding cost I set L=default (promised=0) and use a recent_5 estimate for mu_hat and sigma_hat to react to the new lower-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained lead_time=0 through Period 38; recent demand downshift (Periods 34-38 mean=280, sample std\u224829.64).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). All concluded arrivals through Period 39 show lead_time=0 (no evidence of loss or delay). Recent demand has shifted down versus earlier high regime. I set L to the promised/default (0) since concluded history consistently shows 0. For demand I use a recent_N=5 estimate (Periods 35-39 demands = [266,240,306,276,241]) to capture the current lower-demand regime; mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_recent; sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std_recent. This keeps the base-stock focused on current demand, reducing holding cost while retaining service given observed stable zero lead time.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained lead_time=0 through Period 39 concluded arrivals; new recent downshift in demand: Periods 35-39 mean=265.8, std\u224827.39.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). Concluded arrivals through Period 40 show consistent lead_time=0. Demand has recently downshifted; I use the most recent stable regime (last 5 periods) to forecast. On-hand=26, in-transit=0 so orders must cover current-period demand after decision. Set L=default (promised=0) because concluded history confirms 0. Set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) = (1+L)*mean(demands Periods36-40 = [240,306,276,241,252]) = 263.0 to target the current downshifted mean. Set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) = sqrt(1+L)*sample_std(Periods36-40) = 28.07 to reflect observed volatility. These parameters keep target service high enough for the current regime while limiting holding given holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Sustained lead_time=0 confirmed through Period 40 concluded arrivals; recent demand downshift (Periods 36-40 mean=263.0, sample std\u224828.07).

Last 5 demands (Periods 37-41) = [306,276,241,252,210], mean = 257.0, sample std \u2248 36.26. On-hand = 66, in-transit = 0 \u2014 insufficient to cover (1+L)\xb7mean demand (\u2248257 units) so an order is required. Choose L by 'default' = promised lead time 0 (confirmed by concluded arrivals). Use mu_hat recent_N with N=5 to capture the sustained downshift (mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7recent mean = 257.0). Use sigma_hat recent_N with N=5 to reflect current variability (sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7sample std \u2248 36.26).

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/2 (Period 43). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Concluded arrivals through Period 42 confirm actual lead_time=0. Recent demand (Periods 38-42 = 276,241,252,210,354) shows mean \u2248266.6 and elevated volatility (sample std \u224854.3) driven by a spike in Period 42. To keep service with minimal holding cost I set L to promised (0) and use recent_5 for demand estimates so the base-stock reflects the latest regime.

Carry-over insight: Observed lead_time=0 confirmed through Period 42 concluded arrivals; recent 5-period demand mean shifted to \u2248266.6 (Periods 38-42), sample std \u224854.3.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09 (Period 44). Concluded arrivals through Period 43 confirm observed lead_time = 0 consistently; on-hand=147, in-transit=0. Recent demand has downshifted vs earlier high regime; last 5 concluded demands (Periods 39-43 = 241,252,210,354,143) average 240 with sample std \u224876.56. To adapt quickly to the recent regime while preserving the confirmed lead_time=0, I use promised lead time (default L=0) and a recent_N=5 demand estimate so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the latest demand pattern. This keeps the OR base-stock responsive to the downward shift and limits excess holding given holding cost=$1 versus profit=$2.

Carry-over insight: Observed lead_time=0 confirmed through Period 43 concluded arrivals; recent demand downshift (Periods 39-43 mean=240, sample std\u224876.56).

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16. Historical concluded arrivals confirm lead_time=0; recent demand has downshift (Periods 40-44 demands = [252,210,354,143,209], mean\u2248233.6, std\u224877.78). On-hand=64, in-transit=0 so we need replenishment. Choose L=default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded history consistently shows 0. Set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the recent lower-demand regime (mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_recent = 233.6). Set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect observed volatility (sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std_recent = 77.78). These parameters keep target base-stock responsive to the recent downshift while the OR backend's cap will limit excessive single-period orders.

Carry-over insight: Observed lead_time=0 confirmed through Period 44 concluded arrivals; recent demand downshift (Periods 40-44 mean=233.6, std\u224877.78).

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23. Concluded arrivals through Period 45 confirm actual lead_time=0. Recent demand shows a downshift; last 5 demands (Periods 41-45 = [210,354,143,209,231]) have mean=229.4 and sample std\u224877.13. Use L=0 (calculate from observed lead times). Forecast demand across review+lead (1+L) periods using recent_N=5 to capture the new lower regime. Sigma set from the same recent 5-sample volatility. These parameters keep base-stock aligned with the current lower demand regime and exploit fast same-period replenishment to avoid excess holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Observed lead_time=0 confirmed through Period 45 concluded arrivals; recent demand downshift \u2014 last 5-period mean (Periods 41-45)=229.4, sample std\u224877.13.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30. All concluded arrivals through Period 46 show lead_time=0 (no lost shipments). Recent demand has downshifted vs earlier high regime; last 5 concluded demands (Periods 42-46 = [354,143,209,231,224]) have mean=232.2 and sample std\u224876.51. I set L using the average observed lead time (0) and forecast demand using a recent_N=5 estimate to capture the sustained downshift; sigma_hat uses the same 5-sample volatility. These parameters keep base-stock close to current low-demand regime, minimizing holding cost while maintaining service under observed zero lead time.

Carry-over insight: Observed lead_time=0 confirmed through Period 46 concluded arrivals; recent demand downshift: Periods 42-46 mean=232.2, sample std\u224876.51.
