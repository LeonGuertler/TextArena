Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019-02-11). No on-hand or in-transit inventory and no concluded arrivals to infer lead-time shifts. Historical demands = [231,255,302,272,272] (mean=266.4, std\u224825.8). Promised lead time = 4 periods; no evidence to change it. Use default lead time so backend assumes promised L=4. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample\u2014this balances service level (using full-sample demand mean) against holding cost given modest profit/holding ratio (profit $2, holding $1).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). Product is seasonal basics (socks) with no special calendar events. History: demand samples [231,255,302,272,272] (mean=266.4). Promised lead time = 4 and there are no concluded arrivals yet (Period 1 conclude shows ordered=310 arrived=0) \u2014 this is consistent with actual lead time >=1, so no evidence to change promised L. On-hand=0, in-transit=310 but expected demand over (L+1)=5 periods \u2248 1332 units, so pipeline is currently insufficient; we retain default demand estimate to let OR backend compute an appropriate replenishment given its statistical model. Chosen methods: use default L (promised), default mu_hat to capture long-run mean (1+L)*mean(all samples), and default sigma_hat to reflect full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). These choices balance service level (cover multi-period demand) against holding cost without overreacting to a single unresolved shipment.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. On-hand=0, in-transit=621. Promised lead time=4; no concluded arrivals yet (orders placed in P1/P2 show arrived=0) so cannot infer a shorter/longer actual lead time\u2014use promised. Historical baseline demand mean \u2248266 units, but Period 2 demand spiked to 548 (recent surge). To be responsive to the surge I use a recent window to raise the forecast: set mu_hat using recent_N (last 3 periods) to capture the uplift while keeping L at the promised value. Sigma_hat left as default to let backend scale volatility across the review+lead horizon.

Carry-over insight: Recent demand spike: Period 2 demand=548 vs historical mean\u2248266; treat as potential regime shift until further periods confirm.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Orders from Periods 1\u20133 have not arrived (arrived=0) despite promised L=4 \u2192 shipments overdue; treat actual lead time as longer than promised. On-hand=0, in-transit=1167 (may not arrive soon), recent demand has spiked (Period2=548, Period3=399, Period1=287) \u2014 possible new higher-demand regime. To be responsive, set lead time explicitly longer to cover delayed arrivals (explicit L=6). Use recent_N for demand stats (N=3) to capture the recent higher-demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine raises base stock and cap accordingly. This balances higher service level now versus holding cost risk from delayed/uncertain arrivals.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Inventory on-hand=0, in-transit=1794 but no concluded arrivals in any prior periods (orders placed Periods 1\u20134 all show arrived=0) \u2014 signals shipments are delayed/lost or lead time >> promised 4. Recent demand levels are well above historical baseline (recent demands 287,548,399,338; recent mean\u2248387 vs historical mean\u2248266) so I treat demand as a new higher regime. To be conservative I set lead time explicitly longer to avoid under-ordering; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N=4 to reflect the current elevated mean and volatility and drive higher base stock.

Carry-over insight: Sustained recent demand uplift: last 4-period mean=387 (periods with demands 287,548,399,338) vs historical mean\u2248266; treat as elevated-demand regime until contradicted.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/18. Recent demand elevated: last 4 demands = [287,548,399,338], mean \u2248 387 vs historical mean \u2248 266 \u2014 treat as elevated-demand regime. Observed arrival from Period 1 confirms actual lead time = promised 4 so far; multiple orders remain in-transit (2063) so pipeline is large and will cover elevated demand. To adapt to the higher demand regime while letting the OR backend compute appropriate base-stock given promised L, use L=default (promised), set demand forecast based on the recent 4-period mean (recent_N N=4) and estimate volatility from the same recent window (recent_N N=4). This increases target inventory to reduce stockouts under the sustained uplift while the large in-transit quantity limits aggressive additional ordering.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25. Concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 4 (Period1\u2192arrived P5, Period2\u2192arrived P6). On-hand=40, in-transit=1752 \u2192 very large pipeline relative to demand, so avoid inflating orders. Recent demand regime: last 4 demands (P3\u2013P6 = 399,338,252,329) average \u2248329.5, indicating elevated but variable demand vs older history. Choose L=default to trust promised lead time (consistent with observed 4). Set mu_hat using recent_N N=4 to capture the current elevated-demand regime. Set sigma_hat using recent_N N=4 to reflect recent demand volatility. These params bias the OR backend toward stocking for the recent higher mean while letting the large in-transit pipeline limit actual order quantities.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Observed concluded arrivals show orders from Periods 1\u20133 each had lead_time=4 \u2192 no evidence lead time changed; promised L=4 remains appropriate. Recent demand has shifted upward versus original historical seed: last 5 concluded demands = [399,338,252,329,415], mean \u2248 347, suggesting an elevated-demand regime vs original historical mean \u2248266. On-hand(171)+in-transit(1206)=1377 units; the backend will target base-stock using (1+L)\xd7demand forecast \u2014 using a recent-N demand estimate helps capture the uplift while avoiding overreacting to a single spike. I therefore set L to default (promised), mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to reflect the recent regime and moderate sample size.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent concluded arrivals show consistent actual lead time = 4 (orders placed Periods 1\u20134 arrived with W=4). Demand has shifted up from the original historical sample; using the last 8 concluded demands (Periods 1\u20138: 287,548,399,338,252,329,415,382) gives a robust elevated-demand estimate (mean\u2248369) to size the (1+L) demand forecast while still using the promised lead time. On-hand (416) + in-transit (998) is ample but we keep forecast elevated to avoid stockouts given the sustained high sales; default volatility lets the OR backend compute safety stock from the full sample variance.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-04-15. Observed concluded lead times consistently 4 periods (orders from Periods 1-5 all arrived with lead_time=4). Recent demand remains elevated vs historical: last 5-period demands (Periods 5-9) = [252,329,415,382,322], mean=340 -> (1+L)*mean = 5*340=1700 forecast across review+lead. On-hand 673 + in-transit 933 = 1606, which roughly matches one review+lead period demand (1700) but leaves a small shortfall; choose parameters that reflect sustained elevated regime while avoiding excessive holding cost. Therefore: set L by calculating observed lead times; set mu_hat and sigma_hat from recent_N (N=5) to capture the elevated-demand regime and recent volatility. These parameters steer the OR engine to target a base stock sized to the elevated mean while keeping cap constraints in mind.

Date 2019-04-22. Observed concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=4 (orders placed Periods1-5 arrived with W=4). On-hand=365, in-transit=1088 -> pipeline+on-hand=1453. Recent demand has stayed elevated since Period 5 (periods 5-10 demands = 252,329,415,382,322,308; recent 6-pt mean\u2248334.7). Using L=default (promised 4) because concluded evidence matches promised lead time. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 to capture the sustained uplift regime; backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over these 6 most recent samples. This raises the base-stock to better cover elevated demand while the capped order cap prevents extreme over-ordering.

On-hand=0 but in-transit=1364 units (sufficient coverage for multiple periods). Choose L=default to trust promised lead time (supported by past concluded arrivals). Set mu_hat using recent_N N=4 to capture the sustained uplift and avoid diluting with older low-demand data. Set sigma_hat using recent_N N=4 to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise the backend base-stock to improve service during the elevated regime while sigma_hat from recent data keeps safety stock aligned with recent variability.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). Observed concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=4 (orders placed Periods 1-8 arrived after 4 periods). Recent demand has been elevated since Period 2 with sustained higher sales from Period 5 onward (multiple demands >300, recent concluded demands: periods 5-12 include 252,329,415,382,322,308,427,438). On-hand=0, in-transit=1396 \u2014 ample pipeline arriving under promised L=4 so avoid inflating lead time. I treat demand as shifted to an elevated regime (regime length \u22488 periods from Period 5\u201312) and use recent_N with N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new mean and volatility. L uses default (promised 4) because concluded arrivals consistently confirm L=4. This balances service (higher target stock given elevated mean) against holding cost given large in-transit inventory.

Carry-over insight: Sustained elevated-demand regime detected from Period 5\u201312: recent 8-period demand average materially above historical mean (evidence: demands 252,329,415,382,322,308,427,438); actual lead time confirmed at 4 periods.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13 (Period 14). Historical demand shows a sustained elevated regime since Period 5 (recent 8-period avg materially > historical mean). Actual lead time has been confirmed at 4 periods in conclude messages. Current inventory: on-hand=247, in-transit=1346 (pipeline total=1593) \u2014 ample cover versus recent demand levels but some past shipments were delayed so keep promised L. I choose L=default (use promised 4). For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=8 to capture the sustained elevated-demand regime (will give (1+L)*mean of last 8 samples). For volatility I use recent_N N=8 to reflect recent variation. These settings bias base-stock upward to preserve service during the elevated regime while sigma from recent data controls safety-stock scale to limit excess holding given holding cost=$1/unit/period.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20 (Period 15). Recent history shows a sustained elevated-demand regime since Period 5 (multi-period average materially above pre-run historical mean) and concluded arrivals consistently indicate actual lead time = 4. On-hand=127, in-transit=1464 \u2014 pipeline is large but future arrivals are observed with 4-period lag. I therefore keep L at the promised/default (4) to match observed concluded lead times and let backend treat lead time as promised. For demand I use a recent_N estimate to capture the sustained elevated-demand regime (use last N=8 samples from the elevated regime) so base stock reflects higher demand. For sigma I also use recent_N with N=8 to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise the base_stock to reduce stockouts under the new regime while sigma_hat based on recent variability moderates safety stock to control holding costs given large pipeline.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). On-hand=55, in-transit=1436 (large pipeline arriving per past orders). Historical conclude messages show consistent actual lead time = 4 periods (orders from Periods 1\u201311 that concluded all had lead_time=4). Recent demand remains elevated vs original baseline: recent 8-period demands (Periods 8\u201315) = [382,322,308,427,438,267,275,348], mean \u2248345.9. I therefore keep L at the promised/default (4) since observed lead time matches promise. For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=8 to capture the sustained elevated regime (evidence: persistent higher mean over last 8 periods). I also set sigma_hat to recent_N N=8 to reflect recent volatility. These choices ensure the OR backend builds a base stock around the elevated recent mean (raising service) while sigma reflects current variability; large in-transit plus elevated mu will avoid stockouts given the 4-period lead time and reduce lost-sales cost, while sigma controls safety stock to balance holding cost.

Demand has been in an elevated regime since Period 5 with an 8-period average materially above historical mean (evidence periods 5\u201312). Current on-hand=136 and large in-transit=1287 cover upcoming demand but we should base forecasts on the recent elevated regime. Set L to promised (default=4), and use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets service for the sustained higher demand while capping orders via its cap.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10 (Period 18). Recent history shows a sustained elevated-demand regime confirmed earlier (Periods 5\u201312 average materially above historical mean) and concluded arrivals consistently indicate actual lead time = 4. On-hand=303, in-transit=1184 \u2014 ample pipeline but demand remains higher than long-run baseline. I keep L="default" to use the promised lead time (promised=4) because concluded arrivals confirm a stable 4-period lead time. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N with N=8 to capture the sustained elevated-demand regime (evidence: recent 8-period demands average materially above historical mean per Period 13 insight) so the OR base-stock calculation uses the elevated mean and observed volatility rather than the older low baseline. This raises target inventory to maintain service while the recent volatility (recent 8-period std) informs safety stock to balance profit vs holding cost.

On-hand=282, in-transit=1194 \u2014 ample pipeline but demand has shifted to a higher regime since Period 5. Recent 8-period average demand (~339.5) remains materially above original historical mean (~266). To keep service while avoiding stockouts during confirmed elevated demand, use promised lead time (default) and set demand estimates from the recent 8-period window so the OR backend raises the base stock to match the elevated regime; use recent_N for sigma to reflect recent volatility. This balances higher service level (reduce lost-sales profit loss) against holding cost given large existing pipeline.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=196, in-transit=1233 \u2014 ample pipeline but we must set forecast to reflect the elevated regime to avoid stockouts when pipeline depletes. Set L to default (promised 4) because concluded messages confirm LT=4. Use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained higher mean and recent volatility (8 most recent demand observations capture the elevated regime without overreacting to single spikes). These choices bias base-stock upward to preserve service level while sigma_hat recent_N tightens uncertainty estimate to current variability.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:

Date 2019/7/1 (Period 21). Historical concluded lead time repeatedly observed = 4 periods; recent demand has been elevated vs original historical mean (sustained regime detected from Period 5\u201312 and continued thereafter). On-hand 209 + in-transit 1197 provides large pipeline cover; expected pipeline covers multiple lead periods so we can rely on recent-demand estimates. Set L=default (use promised lead time 4). For mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=8 to capture the sustained elevated-demand regime (regime length = 8 observed in Periods 5\u201312; using N=8 balances responsiveness and stability). These parameters drive the backend to raise the base stock to meet the elevated demand while capping order size to limit excess holding cost.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-08 (Period 22). Demand has been in an elevated regime vs original historical mean (recent rolling demands ~290\u2013370). Concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 4 periods (no lost shipments). On-hand=253 and in-transit=1012 (large pipeline) so we should base demand forecast on the recent elevated regime while keeping promised lead time. Chosen: L=default to reflect promised lead time (4) consistent with concluded arrivals; mu_hat=recent_N (N=8) to capture the sustained elevated-demand regime in the most recent 8 observations and avoid dilution by much older low-demand samples; sigma_hat=recent_N (N=8) to measure volatility from the same recent window so the OR backend sets safety stock appropriate to current variability. This balances service (high pipeline + elevated demand) against holding cost by using recent higher mean and matching recent volatility rather than the long-run historical lower mean.

On-hand=223, in-transit=1074 \u2014 pipeline is ample but demand remains higher than original baseline. I therefore keep L at the promised/default (confirmed by concluded arrivals = 4) and set demand estimates using recent data from the sustained elevated regime to better match current demand and variance. Using recent_N (N=8) captures the elevated mean/volatility from the last prolonged regime and balances service level vs holding cost given large pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Sustained elevated-demand regime in effect since Period 5\u201312 and continuing through later periods (evidence: multi-period averages well above historical mean); actual lead time confirmed at 4 periods from concluded arrivals.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/22 (Period 24). Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 (consistent arrivals from Periods 5\u201323). Demand has been in sustained elevated regime since Period 5 (multi-period averages well above earlier historical mean). On-hand=158 + in-transit=1119 provides large pipeline but demand remains elevated; keep lead time = promised to match observed confirmations. Use recent_N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor forecasts to the most recent elevated regime while smoothing shorter noise; this keeps base-stock responsive to higher demand but caps orders via OR cap. No evidence of lost shipments or lead-time drift to justify explicit L change.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). Demand has been in a sustained elevated regime since Period 5 (multi-period averages well above earlier historical mean). Concluded arrivals show actual lead time consistently 4 periods (many 'arrived' messages confirming ordered on Period t arrived in t+4). On-hand=67, in-transit=1247 \u2014 pipeline large but demand elevated, so keep promised L=4. I select recent demand window to capture the sustained elevated regime when forecasting (use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat). Chosen N=20 to reflect the long elevated regime from Period 5 onward (regime length \u224821 periods), capped by available data; this focuses the base-stock on recent higher mean and volatility to maintain service while avoiding excess ordering given a large pipeline. These parameters steer the OR backend to a higher base-stock (raising service) while sigma_hat from recent data captures elevated variability so the capped order cap constrains overly large orders against holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Sustained elevated-demand regime since Period 5 confirmed by multi-period averages well above historical mean; actual lead time consistently 4 periods (evidence: many concluded arrivals showing lead_time=4).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). Product is womens fine-knit trainer socks; recent history shows a sustained elevated-demand regime since Period 5 (confirmed across many periods through Period 26) and concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4. On-hand=154, in-transit=1292 \u2014 pipeline is large so orders should target elevated demand while avoiding excess holding. I set L to default (promised 4) because concluded history repeatedly confirms 4-period arrivals. For demand and volatility I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (use last 20 demands to compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std), which biases base-stock upward to maintain service during the elevated regime while letting the OR backend cap orders to limit overstock.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=185, in-transit=1203. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead_time=4 (many period conclude messages), and demand has remained in an elevated regime since Period 5 (multi-period averages well above original historical mean). No overdue/lost shipments visible. To keep service while avoiding excess holding, use promised/default lead time (4). For demand forecast use recent regime data: set mu_hat using recent_N with N=8 to capture the sustained elevated 8-period average (keeps forecast responsive to the elevated-demand regime). For volatility use recent_N with N=8 to reflect recent variance. These choices align the OR backend's base-stock calculation to the currently higher demand level while the large in-transit pipeline plus on-hand inventory will moderate ordering.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=310, in-transit=905 (pipeline healthy). I set L to default (promised 4) because concluded history confirms LT=4. For demand I use recent_N (N=8) to capture the sustained elevated regime without over-weighting older low-demand history. For volatility I also use recent_N (N=8) to reflect current variability under the elevated regime.

LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). Historical/concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead_time = 4. Recent demand has been in an elevated regime for many periods (multi-period averages well above original historical mean). On-hand = 232 and in-transit = 1051 (large pipeline). Use promised lead time to match observed arrivals (L=4). For demand forecast use recent-window estimates to capture the sustained elevated regime: set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=8 (captures the most recent elevated-demand regime while respecting sample/cap rules). This keeps the OR base-stock responsive to higher demand while the large pipeline limits urgent ordering and reduces risk of overstock.

Demand has been in a sustained elevated regime since Period 5 (multi-period averages well above the original historical mean); concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4. On-hand = 348 and in-transit = 841, so pipeline+on-hand is healthy but we still target replenishment sized for the elevated-demand regime. Use promised/default L=4 (confirmed by concluded arrivals). For mu_hat, use a recent_N window to capture the current elevated demand regime (N=8 covers the recent stable elevated periods). Keep sigma_hat at default to let backend scale volatility over the full history with the chosen L. These choices keep service high under elevated demand while avoiding excessive extra safety stock beyond what the backend cap permits.

On-hand=210, in-transit=946 (pipeline well-stocked vs demand). I set L to default (use promised lead time=4). For demand I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the sustained elevated-demand regime (use most recent 20 demands to compute (1+L)*mean) and reduce sensitivity to older low-demand samples. Sigma_hat also uses recent_N N=20 to reflect recent volatility.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:

Demand has been in a sustained elevated regime since Period 5 (multi-period averages well above historical mean); actual lead time has been consistently 4 periods in concluded history. Current inventory: on-hand=102, in-transit=992 (large pipeline covering multiple periods). I keep L as default (promised 4) because concluded arrivals repeatedly confirm 4 and pipeline is large. I set mu_hat to recent_N with N=8 to capture the sustained elevated-demand regime (use the last 8 periods' demand average for (1+L)\xb7mean). I keep sigma_hat as default so backend uses overall sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances higher forecasted demand (improved service) against holding cost given the already-large in-transit inventory.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-07 (Period 35). On-hand = 0, in-transit = 1198. All concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time = 4 periods (many concluded messages); demand has been in a sustained elevated regime since Period 5 (multi-period averages materially above original historical mean). With confirmed LT=4, use promised/default lead time so backend aligns with reality. Set mu_hat from recent_N to reflect the sustained elevated-demand regime (use last 20 periods to capture the long-run uplift while still weighing recent variability). Use default sigma_hat (backend's sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) so volatility is estimated from full history and scaled by lead time. This balances service (higher mu_hat to avoid stockouts given in-transit but zero on-hand) against holding cost by letting the OR engine compute the exact safety stock from profit/holding tradeoff.

Historical and concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods; demand has remained in the sustained elevated regime since Period 5 (multi-period averages well above original historical mean). To keep the OR backend aligned with observed realities I keep L at the promised/default (4) while basing demand forecasts on recent elevated data. I use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained elevated-demand regime (useful to raise base-stock and cap appropriately) while smoothing short-term noise. This balances service (avoid stockouts given large in-transit but low on-hand) against holding cost by relying on recent empirical mean/volatility rather than long-ago low-demand samples.

Current on-hand=37, in-transit=1105 \u2014 pipeline is large. I keep L at the promised/default (4) since concluded history confirms lead_time=4. To capture the elevated-demand regime I set mu_hat using recent_N with N=8 (use last 8 demand observations from the elevated period) so the base-stock reflects the recent higher mean; I also set sigma_hat to recent_N N=8 to reflect recent volatility.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:

Current on-hand=147 and in-transit=1070 (total pipeline 1217) \u2014 ample cover vs. near-term demand but we keep safety by sizing forecast from recent elevated regime. Set L to promised (default=4) because concluded arrivals repeatedly confirm 4. Use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat to capture the sustained elevated-demand regime (recent 8-period average materially above long-run mean). Use recent_N (N=8) for sigma_hat to reflect volatility in the same recent window. These choices inform the OR engine to target a base stock centered on the elevated mean while using recent volatility for safety, balancing the $2 profit vs $1 holding cost under confirmed lead time.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:

Current inventory: on-hand=250, in-transit=966 (healthy pipeline). To respect observed lead time stability and capture the elevated-demand regime, set L to default (promised 4). Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the most recent elevated regime; I choose N=8 to cover the sustained uplift window (recent 8 periods) so the OR backend builds a base-stock appropriate for the higher demand while limiting overreaction to single-period noise. This balances service level (avoid stockouts during elevated demand) against holding cost given substantial pipeline inventory.

Current inventory: on-hand=163, in-transit=1117 (comfortable coverage vs. typical weekly demand). To keep the OR backend responsive to the elevated regime while trusting confirmed lead time, I use the promised/default lead time, compute mu_hat from the recent elevated regime (recent 8 periods) to capture the current higher mean, and keep sigma_hat as default (uses full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L)). This balances service (higher mu_hat) against holding cost given large pipeline stock.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:

Current inventory: on-hand=160, in-transit=864 (total pipeline=1024) which comfortably covers multiple future periods at elevated demand.

For demand I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the sustained elevated regime while smoothing short-term noise; sigma_hat also recent_N N=20 to reflect recent volatility.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09 (Period 44). Historical conclude messages show consistent actual lead_time = 4 (many arrivals flagged lead_time=4); recent demand regime remains elevated since Period 5 per prior carry-overs. Current inventory: on-hand 294 + in-transit 946 = 1,240 units, which is ample coverage vs expected demand over review+lead. I choose L=calculate to reflect observed lead-time history (backend will compute average observed lead times = 4). For demand I use recent_N N=8 to capture the sustained elevated-demand regime (use the last 8 concluded demands to form (1+L)*mean forecast) and set sigma_hat recent_N N=8 to capture recent volatility. These settings keep the base-stock tuned to the elevated regime while the calculate lead time fixes ordering timing to observed performance, balancing service level and holding cost given current healthy pipeline.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16 (Period 45). Product is basic women's trainer socks; no holiday spike immediate but high baseline demand has persisted since Period 5. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4. Current inventory: on-hand=300, in-transit=816 (healthy pipeline). Evidence: multiple concluded periods (Periods 5\u201344) show arrivals with lead_time=4 and sustained elevated demand vs early-sample mean. I set L=default to use promised lead time (4) which matches observed actual lead time. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the sustained elevated-demand regime while smoothing short-term noise; this biases the base-stock higher to protect service level given profit/holding tradeoff and abundant pipeline. This balances avoiding stockouts during the continued elevated-demand regime while limiting excess holding by using recent-sample statistics rather than all-time averages.

Date 2019-12-23 (Period 46). Demand regime: sustained elevated-demand regime has been in effect since Period 5 and confirmed repeatedly; recent 8-period average still above long-run baseline. Actual lead time has repeatedly concluded at 4 periods. Inventory: on-hand=343 + in-transit=812 gives strong coverage vs (L+1) periods, but I still target recent demand to avoid understock if elevated demand persists. Choices: set L to default (use promised lead time=4). For mu_hat use recent_N with N=8 to capture the sustained elevated regime (balances responsiveness to recent higher mean while smoothing short blips). For sigma_hat use default to let backend scale variability over the (1+L) horizon. This balances service (protect vs stockouts under elevated demand) against holding cost by relying on recent-demand signal for order quantity while keeping volatility estimates conservative.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30 (Period 47). Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 4 periods and a sustained elevated-demand regime since Period 5 (multi-period averages well above original historical mean). Current inventory: on-hand=217, in-transit=824 (pipeline healthy). To match confirmed LT and elevated recent demand I keep L at the promised value and use recent data to set demand forecast and volatility so the OR backend raises base-stock appropriately: L set to default (promised 4); mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N (N=8) to capture the sustained elevated-demand regime evidenced in recent 8-period averages and reduce lag in response versus full-history statistics. This balances higher service level from elevated demand against holding cost given substantial pipeline inventory.
