Cost tradeoff: profit = $2/unit, holding = $1/unit \u2192 critical fractile q=2/3, implying moderate safety stock but high holding cost penalizes large overstock.

Demand outlook: recent single-period demands (Periods 39\u201345) = [241,252,210,354,143,209,231], mean \u2248 242 and moderate variability; seasonality: date = 2019-12-23 (pre-Christmas) can push demand modestly but recent weeks show a dip then recovery (143 then 209,231), so I lean on the recent 7-period mean ~242 rather than long-run higher means. OR baseline = 257 units (uses older history and promised L=0). Because lead_time = 0, we only need to cover a single upcoming period plus small safety. Required order \u2248 max(0, expected_demand \u2212 on_hand) = 242 \u2212 75 = 167. Add a small buffer (~10 units) for variability and potential Christmas uplift => order 170.
