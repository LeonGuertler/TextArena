Inventory analysis: On-hand=0, in-transit=943. Demand outlook: historical sample mean \u2248266 units/period (use provided samples), so (L+1)=3 periods demand \u2248 798 units. Pipeline coverage: in-transit 943 > 3-period demand \u2248798, so pipeline already covers the required (L+1) demand buffer. Cost tradeoff: profit $4 vs holding $1 favors avoiding extra holding when pipeline is sufficient. OR recommended 63 units (uses promised L and historical mean) \u2014 I reduce to 0 because ordering would create unnecessary holding cost given ample in-transit stock and uncertain/delayed supplier behavior.

Ordering additional units now would likely increase holding cost without materially reducing stockout risk given pipeline already exceeds the safety-adjusted requirement. Although past periods showed delivery failures up to Period 38, Period 40 had a large on-time arrival (800 from P39, lead_time=1), showing supplier can deliver; there is no sustained new evidence of persistent loss since that arrival. Therefore place no order this period to avoid excess holding cost and let pipeline fulfill upcoming demand. Action: order 0 units.",
