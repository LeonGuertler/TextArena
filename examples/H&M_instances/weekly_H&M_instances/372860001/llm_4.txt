Period 47 (2019/12/30) VM Action:
============================================================
{
  "rationale": "a) World/calendar: Date=2019/12/30 (post-Christmas/week between Christmas and New Year) \u2014 apparel/accessory demand typically softens after holiday gift purchases. Product is womens socks (non-seasonal but gift-driven spike in Dec). b) Demand regime: Recent sales (Periods 43\u201346) = [143,209,231,224], mean \u2248202 units/period, which is substantially below earlier reported regime (~268\u2013309). This suggests a short-term post-holiday demand drop. c) Lead time / missing orders: Multiple concluded arrivals confirm actual lead_time = 4 periods (consistent through history); in-transit=962 matches orders from Periods 43\u201346 (arrivals scheduled P47\u2013P50). No lost orders indicated. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=154; in-transit=962 (including 379 arriving during Period 47). Total pipeline (on-hand+in-transit)=1,116 units. Forecast L+1 horizon = 5 periods; using conservative demand forecast = 200 units/period \u2192 required coverage \u22481,000 units. Current pipeline already exceeds this. Holding cost is high ($1/unit/period) vs profit $2/unit; avoid excess inventory. e) Final order logic: Do not place additional order this period to avoid unnecessary holding costs; existing pipeline provides adequate coverage for the lead-time horizon.",
  "carry_over_insight": "New short-term demand drop: Periods 43\u201346 (2019/12/2\u20132019/12/23) sales [143,209,231,224], mean \u2248202 units/period \u2014 treat as evidence of a post-holiday lower-demand regime until contradicted; lead_time remains confirmed = 4 periods (multiple arrivals).",
