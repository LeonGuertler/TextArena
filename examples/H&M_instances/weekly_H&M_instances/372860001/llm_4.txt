Inventory & pipeline: on-hand 174 + in-transit 793 = 967 units, short \u22483 units vs target. No evidence of a new sustained demand regime (need \u22653 full periods of consistent shift) beyond normal holiday variability. Lead time: previously confirmed as 4 periods; no new anomalies or lost orders observed. Order logic: pipeline essentially matches the 5-period target and placing any sizable order now (which will arrive after 4 periods) risks extra holding cost given holding=$1/unit/period and modest upside uncertainty. Place no order this period to avoid unnecessary holding cost while monitoring next periods for holiday demand realization.",
