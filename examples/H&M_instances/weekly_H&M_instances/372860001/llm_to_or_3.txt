Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11, no arrivals or conclude history yet; product is basic womens trainer socks with no obvious seasonality around this date. No evidence of delayed or lost shipments (in-transit=0, no conclude messages), so use promised lead time. Historical demand samples = [231,255,302,272,272]; no changepoint detected. Use default estimators: L = promised (0), mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) to reflect baseline demand, sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples) to capture observed variability. This balances service (mean demand coverage) against holding cost given profit/Holding ratio.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. SKU 372860001 (women's trainer socks). History: Period 1 conclude shows an order placed in Period 1 arrived in Period 1 (arrived=278, lead_time=0) \u2014 confirms actual lead time = 0. Current on-hand=0, in-transit=0 and Period 1 demand=287 with sold=278 (stockout occurred). I use promised/default lead time = 0 (confirmed). Demand forecast: use full-sample mean of past demands (231,255,302,272,272) = 266.4 units for the review+lead window (1+L=1). Volatility: sample std dev = 23.29, scaled by sqrt(1+L)=1 gives sigma_hat=23.29. These settings target a base-stock around the historical mean with moderate safety stock reflecting observed variability while avoiding excess holding given holding cost=$1 and profit=$2.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead time = 0 periods (Period 1 conclude: ordered on Period 1 arrived in Period 1).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Concluded arrivals in Periods 1\u20132 show lead_time=0 (orders placed arrived same period). No in-transit or on-hand inventory; recent sells exhausted receipts. Use observed lead time=0. Demand history (samples [231,255,302,272,272]) has mean=266.4 and std\u224823.29; no strong sustained regime shift detected despite isolated high demand in Period 2 conclude. Set L by averaging observed lead times (0). Use default mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) = 266.4 to match backend base-stock anchoring. Use default sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples) = 23.294 to reflect historical variability and keep service/holding balance given profit=$2 and holding=$1 (q=2/(2+1)=0.666).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Concluded history (Periods 1\u20133) shows all orders arrived same period (lead_time=0). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, recent demands include a large spike (548) but overall sample mean is stable. I set L using the observed lead times (average of concluded lead times = 0). I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat computed from all available demand samples ([231,255,302,272,272,287,548,399]) so the OR backend sees a representative mean and volatility that include the recent spike. This balances service (capture high demand episodes) against holding cost by keeping base-stock tied to the full-sample mean and measured variability.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead time = 0 periods (arrived in Periods 1\u20133 for orders placed in those same periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $648.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. Recent concluded periods (1\u20134) show a clear upward demand regime vs. historical seed data: demands = [287,548,399,338], mean=393.0. Lead time has been confirmed repeatedly as 0 (Periods 1\u20134 conclude). I set L using the promised/default (0). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the new high-demand regime: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(recent 4 demands) = 393.0 to ensure the base-stock reflects current demand; sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*sample_std(recent 4) = 113.0 to size safety stock for observed volatility. These parameters raise target inventory to improve service during the higher-demand regime while the holding cost ($1) vs profit ($2) is reflected by the OR backend's service-level calculation.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand upshift detected: recent concluded demands (Periods 1\u20134) = [287,548,399,338], recent mean=393.0; confirmed actual lead time = 0 periods (Periods 1\u20134 concludes).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. Concluded history shows sustained actual lead time = 0 and a recent demand upshift (Periods 1\u20134 concluded demands = [287,548,399,338], mean=393). On-hand=190, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. To protect service versus holding cost I set L to promised (0) and base demand forecast using the recent high-demand regime (most recent changepoint covering 4 periods). Sigma uses the same 4-period sample to capture elevated volatility. These parameters raise the base-stock to cover the new demand regime while keeping holding cost in check.

Carry-over insight: actual lead time = 0 confirmed (Periods 1\u20135 concludes); sustained demand upshift detected: Periods 1\u20134 demands=[287,548,399,338], mean=393.0

Daily Reward (R_t): $549.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25. All concluded periods (1\u20136) confirm actual lead time = 0. On-hand=109, in-transit=0. Recent realized demands (Periods 3\u20136) = [399,338,252,329] show a cooler recent average than earlier upshift; I therefore forecast using a recent-window estimate to react to the latest regime. Set L to promised (0) because all concludes confirm 0. Use recent_N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand regime (N=4 chosen as recent regime length, >=3). This keeps inventory responsive (lower safety stock than the earlier large upshift) while preserving service given same-period arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time = 0 confirmed through Period 6; recent demand cooled vs. prior upshift \u2014 use recent 4-period mean=329.5 as current demand baseline.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Concluded history through Period 7 confirms actual lead time = 0 (all recent orders arrived same period). Recent demand has cooled vs. the earlier upshift; using recent_N=4 (Periods 4\u20137 demands = [338,252,329,415]) to set demand forecast. Set L = default (promised 0) to reflect confirmed same-period arrivals. mu_hat = recent_N mean = 333.5 units (covers review+lead). sigma_hat = recent_N std = 66.67 (sqrt(1+L) * sample std of last 4). These parameters keep base-stock responsive to the now-lower recent demand while limiting holding cost given zero lead time and volatile recent demand.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead time = 0 periods through Period 7; recent demand cooled \u2014 last 4 concluded demands (Periods 4\u20137) mean=333.5, std\u224866.67.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08. Concluded history through Period 8 confirms actual lead time = 0 periods (consistent arrivals each period). Recent demand shows a cooled but still-elevated regime; last 4 concluded demands (Periods 5\u20138 = 252,329,415,382) have mean 344.5 and std ~61.6. I therefore keep L at promised (0) and set demand forecasts using recent_N (N=4) to capture the current regime; sigma based on same 4-period window. These settings supply the OR engine a rolling baseline (mu_hat) and realistic volatility (sigma_hat) so orders cover next-period demand while limiting holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Recent 4-period demand baseline updated: Periods 5\u20138 mean=344.5, std\u224861.6 (use for short-term forecasting); confirmed actual lead time = 0 through Period 8.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15. Actual lead time has been consistently 0 through Period 9 (concludes). Recent demand has moderated from the earlier upshift; last 4 concluded demands (Periods 6\u20139) = [329,415,382,322], mean=362.0, sample std\u224844.35. On-hand=54, in-transit=0 so we need to replenish for current review+lead window (L=0). I set L using the observed average lead time (calculate). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the most recent regime (cooling vs prior spike) so the OR backend targets a base-stock tuned to current demand and realized lead time, balancing service level against $1 holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead time = 0 through Period 9; recent 4-period demand (Periods 6\u20139) mean=362.0, std\u224844.35 (use for short-term forecasting).

Date 2019-04-22 (Period 11). All concluded periods through Period 10 confirm actual lead time = 0 and no lost shipments; on-hand=74, in-transit=0. Recent demand shows a cooled but elevated level vs early history; I use the most recent 4 concluded demands (Periods 7\u201310 = [415,382,322,308], mean=356.75, std\u224850.38) as the short-term demand baseline. Set L to the observed average lead time (0) to reflect confirmed same-period arrivals. mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N=4 to react to the post-upshift cooling while keeping responsiveness to further short-term changes. These parameters provide the OR backend a demand forecast and volatility that match observed short-run behavior, balancing service level (z*\u22480.43 embedded in OR) against holding cost.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Actual lead time confirmed 0 through Period 11. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish to cover next-period demand. Demand regime has shifted recently; use the most recent 4 concluded demands (Periods 8\u201311 = [382,322,308,427]) to capture current baseline and volatility. Set L to the observed average lead time (0). Use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets service for the current demand regime while limiting excess holding given holding cost >0.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06): on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Concluded history through Period 12 consistently shows orders arriving same period \u2192 actual lead time = 0. Recent demand has cooled relative to earlier upshift; use the most recent 4 concluded demands (Periods 9\u201312: [322,308,427,438]) as the short-term baseline. Set lead time to the observed average (0) and forecast demand across review+lead using the recent-4 mean (373.75). Use recent-4 sample volatility to capture current variability (std \u2248 68.27). These choices keep the base-stock responsive to the latest regime while avoiding excess inventory given zero pipeline and confirmed same-period arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $397.00

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Actual lead time has been consistently 0 through Period 13 (all concluded orders arrived same period). On-hand=137, in-transit=0, so we must cover current-period demand plus short horizon. Recent 4 concluded demands (Periods 10\u201313 = [308,427,438,267]) show a stable short-term mean = 360 and std \u2248 74. I set L=0 (use promised/observed 0), mu_hat based on recent 4-period mean to capture the current demand regime (mu_hat=(1+L)*mean=360), and sigma_hat from the same recent 4 samples (sigma_hat\u224874) so the OR backend targets service appropriate to the current elevated but slightly variable demand while limiting extra holding given on-hand stock.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20 (Period 15). On-hand=122, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show actual lead time = 0 confirmed through Period 14. Recent demand has moderated vs earlier spikes; use most recent 4 concluded demands (Periods 11\u201314 = [427,438,267,275]) as short-term baseline. Set L to promised/default (0). Set mu_hat using recent_N (N=4): (1+L)*mean(Periods11\u201314)=351.75 units. Set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4): sqrt(1+L)*std(Periods11\u201314)=80.90 units. These parameters keep the base-stock tied to the latest demand regime while avoiding excess inventory given current on-hand and zero pipeline.

Recent demand has cooled from earlier upshift; last 4 concluded demands (Periods 12\u201315 = [438,267,275,348]) give a short-term baseline. I set L to promised (default 0) because concluded history shows lead time=0. I use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to anchor to the most recent regime (captures cooling) and recent_N for sigma_hat to represent current volatility; this balances service level versus holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1 (q=2/3 \u2192 moderate service target).

I set L to promised/default (0) since concludes confirm 0. I use recent_N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the latest regime (N=4 fits the recent changepoint at Period 15). mu_hat = (1+L)*recent_mean = 327.25 to target service for the immediate period; sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*recent_std = 37.78 to reflect current demand variability. This balances profit vs holding cost by using a short-term baseline (reducing overstock vs using older higher means) while keeping safety stock via sigma.

I set L using default (promised) = 0 since concluded arrivals confirm 0. For demand I use a recent_4 window (Periods 16\u201319 demands = [370,297,294,334]) to capture the latest regime: mean=323.75 and sample std\u224835.79. mu_hat = (1+L)*mean => 323.75; sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*sample_std => 35.79. These choices bias the base-stock toward current realized demand (limiting excess holding cost) while preserving service given observed low lead time.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-08 (Period 22). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Actual lead time has been consistently 0 through Period 21 (concluded history). Recent demand cooled vs earlier upshift \u2014 last 4 concluded demands (Periods 18\u201321 = [294,334,289,317]) give mean=308.5 and std\u224818.13. Use L=promised (default 0) since all concluded messages confirm 0 lead time. Set mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the current short-term baseline (mu_hat=(1+L)*mean_recent=308.5). Set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4) to reflect current low volatility (sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std_recent=18.13). These parameters keep the base-stock responsive to the recent cooled demand while avoiding excess holding given holding cost=$1 vs profit=$2.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead time = 0 through Period 21; new short-term demand baseline (Periods 18\u201321) mean=308.5, std\u224818.13.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/15 (Period 23). Recent concluded demand has cooled vs earlier upshift. On-hand=5, in-transit=0 (no overdue shipments). I set lead time L to promised 0 (confirmed repeatedly through Period 22). For demand I use a recent_N=4 short-term baseline (last 4 concluded demands Periods 19\u201322 = [334,289,317,313]) to capture the recent cooling; mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_recent = 313.25. Volatility uses the same recent 4 sample std (sample std \u2248 18.55) scaled by sqrt(1+L) => sigma_hat=18.55. These choices keep target base-stock responsive to the recent lower demand while reflecting low lead time and minimal pipeline, minimizing holding cost given small on-hand inventory.

Carry-over insight: New short-term demand baseline (Periods 19\u201322) mean=313.25, std\u224818.55; actual lead time still 0 through Period 22.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/22 (Period 24). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 through Period 23. Recent demand (Periods 20\u201323 concluded) = [289,317,313,352], 4-period mean=317.75, std\u224825.96. I set L = promised (0) because all concludes show 0 lead time. Use a recent_4 demand estimate (mu_hat) to capture the latest uptick in Period 23 while weighting recent cooling earlier in July. sigma_hat uses the same 4-period sample to reflect current volatility. These settings keep base-stock responsive to recent demand (raise service with modest extra safety) while avoiding excess holding cost given holding=$1/unit/period.

Carry-over insight: New short-term demand baseline (Periods 20\u201323) mean=317.75, std\u224825.96; actual lead time confirmed = 0 through Period 23.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/29 (Period 25). Actual lead time has been consistently 0 through Period 24 (concluded arrivals). Recent short-term demand baseline (Periods 20\u201323) mean=317.75, std\u224825.96 \u2014 stable low variance. On-hand=52, in-transit=0 so inventory is below a one-period demand. I set L=0 (use promised/observed 0) and use a recent_4 forecast for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the latest regime (Periods 20\u201323). This raises target base-stock to cover this short-term demand while keeping safety stock moderate (sigma from recent 4) to limit holding cost given holding=$1/unit and profit=$2/unit (service level q=0.666...).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). All concluded periods through Period 25 confirm actual lead time = 0. Recent demand cooled: last 4 concluded demands (Periods 22\u201325) = [313,352,277,256], mean=299.5, std\u224842.2. On-hand=72, in-transit=0; with L=0 the OR policy should target a single-period demand base stock. I set L=default (promised) = 0 given consistent confirmations. I use a recent_4 demand forecast (mu_hat=(1+L)*recent_mean=299.5) to capture the recent cooling and reduce overstock risk; sigma_hat uses recent_4 std (sqrt(1+L)*std\u224842.2) so the backend sizes safety stock to the observed short-term volatility. This balances service (use recent demand mean) against holding cost (lower target vs. longer-run mean).

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead time = 0 through Period 25; new short-term demand baseline (Periods 22\u201325) mean=299.5, std\u224842.2.

LLM Rationale:

Recent demand cooled; use most recent 4 concluded demands (Periods 23\u201326 = [352,277,256,258]) as short-term forecast: mean=285.75, std\u224839.12. Setting L=0 (default) and mu_hat as (1+L)*recent_4_mean captures current baseline while sigma_hat from recent 4 captures reduced volatility \u2014 this lowers safety stock vs. earlier upshift and reduces holding costs while preserving service given observed lead time=0.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19 (Period 28). On-hand=5, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show actual lead time = 0 consistently through Period 27. Recent demand has cooled: last 4 concluded demands (Periods 24\u201327) = [277,256,258,301], mean=273.0, std\u224820.95. I set L to promised/default (0) because concluded history confirms 0 lead time. I use a recent_4 demand estimate for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent downward regime (N=4 chosen per detected changepoint at Period 24\u201327). mu_hat = (1+L)*recent_mean = 273.0 to target service for one-period demand; sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*recent_std = 20.95 to reflect reduced volatility. This tightens inventory to lower holding cost while keeping service for the shorter recent demand level.

I set L to promised (0) since all concluded arrivals through Period 28 show lead time 0. I use a recent_N demand estimate (N=4, Periods 25\u201328 demands = [256,258,301,294]) to capture the current short-term baseline: mean=277.25 and population std\u224820.41. mu_hat = (1+L)*recent_mean covers one period of expected demand given 0 lead time; sigma_hat uses sqrt(1+L)*recent_std to reflect observed volatility. This keeps service for the immediate period while limiting holding cost exposure.

LLM Rationale:

Recent demand has cooled vs earlier periods; last 4 concluded demands (Periods 26\u201329 = [258,301,294,229]) show mean=270.5 and sample std\u224833.48. I use L=promised (0) since concludes confirm same-period arrivals. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the recent cooling regime (N=4 chosen because a clear change vs prior baseline is visible and 4 most recent periods are most relevant). This keeps the base-stock moderate to avoid excess holding given current lower demand and holding cost.=1.0 vs profit=2.0 (service level q=2/(2+1)=0.6667).

Carry-over insight: New short-term demand baseline (Periods 26\u201329) mean=270.5, std\u224833.48; actual lead time remains 0 through Period 29.

Date 2019/9/9 (Period 31). On-hand=11, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead time has been consistently 0 through Period 30, and recent history shows variable weekly demand but no new changepoint requiring deviation. I use the promised/default lead time (L=0) since all concluded arrivals confirm same-period delivery. For demand I use the default (1+L)*mean of all 30 concluded samples to let the OR engine compute base-stock with full-sample statistics; this balances service level vs holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1. Sigma is the sample std of all 30 demands (scaled by sqrt(1+L)=1) to reflect observed volatility. These parameters provide a stable input to the OR engine while acknowledging low on-hand (11) relative to mean demand, so the engine will replenish toward its computed base-stock.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-16 (Period 32). Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 through Period 31. Recent demand has cooled vs earlier months: last 4 concluded demands (Periods 28\u201331) = [294,229,274,254], mean=262.75, std\u224827.79. On-hand=93, in-transit=0 so current inventory covers ~0.35 of one-period demand; ordering needed. I set L=recent_4 but equal to 0 (observed), mu_hat and sigma_hat based on recent 4-sample baseline to make the OR backend target a base-stock appropriate to the current lower-demand regime and avoid excess holding given holding cost=$1/unit/period vs profit=$2/unit.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead time = 0 through Period 31; new short-term demand baseline (Periods 28\u201331) mean=262.75, std\u224827.79.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-23. On-hand=27, in-transit=0. Actual lead time has been consistently 0 through Period 32 (concludes). Recent demand has cooled versus earlier baselines; last 4 concluded demands (Periods 29\u201332) = [229,274,254,248], mean=251.25, sample std\u224818.52. I set L to promised/default (0) because concludes show no lead-time slip. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the recent cooled regime: mu_hat = (1+L)*recent mean to target one-period demand; sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*recent sample std to reflect recent volatility. This tightens the base-stock toward the current lower demand to reduce holding cost while maintaining service given lead time=0.

Carry-over insight: New short-term demand baseline detected: Periods 29\u201332 mean=251.25, std\u224818.52 (evidence: concluded demands [229,274,254,248]); actual lead time still 0 through Period 32.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-30 (Period 34). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Actual lead time has been consistently 0 through Period 33 (many concluded arrivals). Recent concluded demands for Periods 30\u201333 = [274,254,248,405]; last period (33) shows a large demand (405) but was partly censored by stockout (sold=260). I treat this as a genuine spike but keep a short horizon forecast using the most recent 4 concluded periods to be responsive. Set L=0 (confirmed by concluded history). Set mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) => (1+L)*mean_last4 = 295.25 to capture the higher recent baseline. Set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4) sample std \u2248 74.04 to reflect increased volatility from the spike. These parameters increase target stock to reduce costly stockouts given profit=$2 vs holding=$1, while the higher sigma preserves safety stock for variability.

Carry-over insight: New short-term demand baseline (Periods 30\u201333) mean=295.25, std\u224874.04 (evidence: concluded demands [274,254,248,405]); actual lead time still 0 through Period 33.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-07 (Period 35). On-hand=16, in-transit=0 \u2014 low cover entering the period. Concluded history through Period 34 confirms actual lead time = 0. Recent demand shows a short-term regime change: last 4 concluded demands (Periods 31\u201334) = [254,248,405,312], mean=304.75, std\u224872.80. I set L to promised/default (0) because all concludes confirm same-period arrivals. I use a recent_4 forecast for mu_hat to reflect the latest regime and keep variability in sigma_hat via recent_4 sample std. These parameters supply the OR backend with a base-stock tuned to the current short-term mean while accounting for observed volatility, balancing service (high profit relative to holding cost) against holding cost given low on-hand and zero pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead time = 0 through Period 34; new short-term demand baseline (Periods 31\u201334) mean=304.75, std\u224872.80.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-14 (Period 36). On-hand=71, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 through Period 35. Recent changepoint: short-term baseline (Periods 31\u201334) mean=304.75, std\u224872.80 \u2014 evidence of a higher recent mean vs earlier cooling episodes and recognized in history. With lead time reliably 0 we set L=0 (default). For demand forecast use recent_N (N=4) to capture the latest regime: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_last4 = 304.75. Volatility uses recent_N std scaled by sqrt(1+L): sigma_hat = 72.80. These choices let the OR engine place orders to cover this immediate-period demand regime while reflecting the elevated variability, balancing service level (high profit per unit) against holding cost.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). All concluded periods through Period 37 confirm actual lead time = 0. On-hand=32, in-transit=0; recent demand cooled. I use a short-term (most recent 4 concluded periods) baseline because demand has shown multiple regime shifts and the latest 4-period mean best represents current demand (Periods 34\u201337 demands = [312,266,240,306], mean=281.0, std\u224829.57). Set L to promised/default (0) to match confirmed history. mu_hat set to (1+L)*recent-4-mean = 281.0 to target current one-period demand; sigma_hat set to recent-4 std scaled by sqrt(1+L) = 29.57. These parameters keep the base-stock focused on the current lower demand to reduce holding cost while preserving service given observed zero lead time.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead time = 0 through Period 37; new short-term demand baseline (Periods 34\u201337) mean=281.0, std\u224829.57.

Recent short-term demand regime is best represented by the 4-period baseline around Periods 34\u201337 (mean\u2248281, std\u224829.57). To restore service while limiting holding cost I use promised lead time L=0 and set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the recent-4 regime so the OR engine targets supply for the current short-term demand level rather than longer-run older samples.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). On-hand=43, in-transit=0; historical concluded lead time consistently 0 through Period 39 so use L=0. Recent demand has cooled; use most recent 4 concluded periods (Periods 36\u201339 demands = [240,306,276,241]) as short-term baseline. This keeps forecast responsive to the latest regime and limits holding given low on-hand. Parameters chosen: L=default(promised)=0; mu_hat = (1+L)*recent_4_mean = 265.75 units; sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*recent_4_std \u2248 31.62 to reflect current volatility and drive an appropriate service level vs holding-cost tradeoff.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). On-hand=72, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 through Period 41. Recent demand has cooled; last 4 concluded demands (Periods 38-41) = [276,241,252,210], mean=244.75, std\u224827.39. I set L=default (promised=0) and use a recent_4 forecast for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the short-term cooled baseline so the OR backend orders to cover the next (L+1) period of demand while avoiding excess holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead time = 0 through Period 41; new short-term demand baseline (Periods 38\u201341) mean=244.75, std\u224827.39.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/2 (Period 43). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 periods through Period 42. Recent 4 concluded demands (Periods 39\u201342) = [241,252,210,354], mean=264.25, std\u224862.41. I set L=0 (explicit) because every concluded arrival shows 0 lead time. I use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand regime (including the large Period 42 spike) so the OR engine responds to current volatility while keeping target inventory moderate (mu_hat = (1+L)*recent_mean). This balances service (react to spike) vs holding cost by using a short recent window rather than the long-run mean.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09. SKU is basic socks (holiday season near but recent demand has cooled). On-hand=149, in-transit=0. Actual lead time confirmed = 0 through Period 43. Recent 4 concluded demands (Periods 40\u201343) = [252,210,354,143], mean=239.75, std\u224888.43 \u2014 I treat this as the current short-term regime. Use promised/default L=0; set mu_hat and sigma_hat from recent 4-period statistics so the OR engine targets the current lower-demand regime and avoids excess holding cost while maintaining service.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead time = 0 through Period 43; new short-term demand baseline (Periods 40\u201343) mean=239.75, std\u224888.43.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16 (Period 45). Actual lead time has been consistently 0 through Period 44. Recent demand has cooled; use the most recent 4 concluded demands (Periods 41\u201344 = [210,354,143,209], mean=229.0) as short-term baseline. Set L=0 (confirmed), mu_hat as (1+L)*recent-4-mean to target the next-period demand, and sigma_hat as sqrt(1+L)*std of the same recent 4 samples to reflect current volatility. This keeps base_stock responsive to the recent drop in demand while the cap will limit extreme orders given observed variability.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (pre-Christmas). Confirmed actual lead time = 0 historically through Period 45. Recent concluded demands (Periods 42\u201345) = [354,143,209,231], recent 4-mean = 234.25 and std \u2248 76.36, indicating a short-term demand cooling vs earlier baselines. On-hand=37, in-transit=0 so we must replenish to cover next period's demand. I set L to promised 0 (supported by persistent confirmed zero lead time). I use a recent-4 forecast for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the latest regime (cooling + higher variability spike from period 42), which nudges the OR backend toward moderate base-stock that balances $2 profit vs $1 holding cost.

Carry-over insight: New short-term demand baseline (Periods 42\u201345) mean=234.25, std=76.36; actual lead time still 0 through Period 45.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30 Period 47. On-hand=49, in-transit=0 and actual lead time has been consistently 0 through Period 46. Recent demand has cooled; last 4 concluded demands (Periods 43\u201346 = [143,209,231,224]) give mean=201.75 and std\u224840.24. To balance service level vs holding cost, I set L=0 (promised lead time), and use recent 4-period demand to set mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets the short-term baseline while avoiding excess inventory given low on-hand and no pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead time = 0 through Period 46; new short-term demand baseline (Periods 43\u201346) mean=201.75, std\u224840.24.
