Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019-02-11). Historical demands: [231,255,302,272,272], mean=266.4; on-hand=0, in-transit=0, no concluded arrivals to infer lead time. Promised lead time=2. No recent changepoint or season signal in available data. Use default lead time and default demand/volatility aggregation ((1+L)\xd7mean, sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so OR backend applies full-sample estimates and the capped policy to balance service vs holding cost.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). On-hand=0, in-transit=310 from Period 1 order (arrived=0 in Period 1 conclude) \u2014 expected given promised lead time=2. Historical demands = [231,255,302,272,272], mean ~266.4. No evidence yet to alter promised lead time or demand regime. Use default lead time (promised=2) so backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean demand and default volatility; this keeps target base-stock aligned with historical average while allowing backend cap to limit single-period order. Conservatively do not downweight or upweight demand until arrivals confirm actual lead time or demand shift.

Carry-over insight: Outstanding order of 310 units placed Period 1; no arrivals observed yet (consistent with promised L=2).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019-02-25). Recent history shows an order placed in Period 1 arrived in Period 2 with observed lead_time=1 (Period 2 conclude: ordered on Period 1, lead_time was 1). On-hand=0, in-transit=311. Given the single observed lead-time datapoint, I set L to be the calculated average of observed lead times (captures the evidence L\u22481). Demand history samples [231,255,302,272,272] show mean demand \u2248266.4; I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std consistently with the inferred L. This keeps the base-stock anchored to historical demand while letting the OR engine size safety stock per profit/holding tradeoff; treating L via 'calculate' ensures we react to the observed shorter lead-time and avoid over-ordering given in-transit stock.

Carry-over insight: Observed actual lead time = 1 period (Period 2 conclude: ordered on Period 1 arrived Period 2).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04 (Period 4). Recent concludes show actual lead time = 1 period (Period 2 conclude: order on P1 arrived in P2; Period 3 conclude: order on P2 arrived in P3). On-hand = 0, in-transit = 374 (order placed in Period 3). Demand history = [231,255,302,272,272], mean=266.4. Given consistent observed L=1, use calculated lead time to reflect realized supply speed; use default demand/volatility formulas (which scale with 1+L) so backend computes base-stock and cap appropriately. This balances service (higher mu_hat because L=1 doubles the review+lead period) against holding cost (profit/holding implies moderate service quantile).

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time regime: observed lead_time=1 period in Period 2 and Period 3 concludes; outstanding in-transit order exists from Period 3 (374 units).

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/11. Recent concludes show actual lead time = 1 period for orders placed in Periods 1 and 2 (arrived in Periods 2 and 3); Period 4 had no arrival for the Period 3 order (possible loss) but overall recent lead-time regime is 1. On-hand=0, in-transit=706 (outstanding from prior orders). Demand has stepped up recently (recent concludes: 287, 548, 399, 338) \u2014 I use the most recent regime for demand forecasting. Choices: set L based on recent lead-time observations (N=2) to reflect the 1-period regime; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 4 demand samples (N=4) to capture the higher recent demand mean and volatility. This increases the base-stock to protect service given higher demand and observed short lead time while sigma_hat recent_N raises safety stock for variability. 

Carry-over insight: Actual lead-time regime shifted to 1 period (observed in Period 2 and Period 3 concludes: ordered on Period 1\u2192arrived Period 2; ordered on Period 2\u2192arrived Period 3). Evidence: Period 2 conclude and Period 3 conclude.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019/3/18): recent demand samples = [231,255,302,272,272], on-hand=122, in-transit=481. Concluded lead-time observations: 1 (P2 conclude), 1 (P3 conclude), 2 (P5 conclude) \u2192 mixed regime with average >1. To capture observed lead-time variability, set L to be calculated from observed lead times (backend will average). Demand forecast and risk handled via defaults so backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples; this is conservative given stable demand history and remaining in-transit stock.

Carry-over insight: Observed concluded lead times = [1,1,2] (orders on P1\u2192P2, P2\u2192P3, P3\u2192P5); recent average lead time \u22481.33 indicating intermittent 2-period delays.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date=2019-03-25 (Period 7). SKU 372860001 has on-hand=0, in-transit=568. Recent concluded lead times = [1,1,2] (orders on P1\u2192P2, P2\u2192P3, P3\u2192P5) indicating mostly 1-period lead time with intermittent 2-period delays; recent average ~1.33. Demand has been elevated and volatile in recent periods (recent demands: P2\u2013P6 = [548,399,338,252,329]). To protect service while acknowledging occasional 2-period delays, I set L by averaging the last 3 observed lead times, and use recent data for demand mean and volatility over the last 5 periods to capture the higher recent demand regime. This balances higher safety stock against holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

Carry-over insight: Intermittent lead-time regime: observed lead_times [1,1,2] (Period concludes P2,P3,P5); recent average lead_time\u22481.33 indicating mostly 1-period with occasional 2-period delays.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date=2019-04-01 (Period 8). Recent concluded lead times = [1,1,2] (Periods 2,3,5) -> intermittent 1-period with occasional 2-period delays; recent average \u22481.33. On-hand=0, in-transit=814 (covers multiple periods). Demand recent run (Periods 3\u20137) shows elevated mean and volatility versus older samples. I set L to recent_N to capture the current intermittent lead-time regime. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N (N=5) to base forecast and volatility on the most recent 5 demand observations (Periods 3\u20137), so the backend's base-stock and cap reflect the higher recent demand and variability while accounting for the shorter/variable lead time and avoiding excessive overstock if delays are transient.

Carry-over insight: Intermittent lead-time regime: observed lead_times [1,1,2] (Periods 2,3,5 conclude); recent average lead_time\u22481.33 indicating mostly 1-period with occasional 2-period delays.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08 (Period 9). On-hand=100, in-transit=332. Historical concluded lead times show intermittent regime (mostly 1, occasional 2\u20133); latest concludes include a 3-period delay (ordered P5\u2192arrived P8). Demand history moderate but volatile. To protect service against intermittent multi-period delays, I estimate L from recent observed lead times (most relevant signal) using recent_N=4. For demand and volatility I use default aggregation so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over all samples, ensuring base_stock scales with the chosen lead-time estimate while keeping demand estimate anchored to full-history mean.

Carry-over insight: Intermittent lead-time regime persists and has widened: observed lead_times include 1,1,2,3 (Period concludes show orders P1\u2192P2, P2\u2192P3, P3\u2192P5, P5\u2192P8); recent average lead time elevated and variable \u2014 protect against occasional 2\u20133 period delays.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15 P10. On-hand=0, in-transit=613. Historical concluded lead_times show intermittency: recent observed = [1,1,2,3] (avg ~1.33) with some 2\u20133 period delays and occasional lost/late arrivals. To protect service while avoiding excess holding cost I set L based on recent lead-time behavior (average of last 4 observed lead times). Demand history (5 samples, mean=266.4) is stable so use default demand aggregation ((1+L)\xd7mean) and default volatility (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so backend scales safety stock to the inferred L. This balances higher protection for occasional 2\u20133 period delays while not overreacting to one-off spikes.

Carry-over insight: Intermittent lead-time regime: recent concluded lead_times = [1,1,2,3]; protect against occasional 2\u20133 period delays (avg \u22481.33).

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). Recent demand history shows high, volatile weekly demand (samples mean=266.4; recent demands often >300). Concluded lead times in history = [1,1,2,3] (orders placed P1\u2192P2, P2\u2192P3, P3\u2192P5, P5\u2192P8) indicating an intermittent longer-lead regime; protect against occasional 2\u20133 period delays. On-hand=0, in-transit=710 \u2014 substantial pipeline but some prior orders were delayed/lost. I set L by averaging the 4 most recent concluded lead times to reflect the current intermittent regime (recent_N, N=4). I set mu_hat explicit to (1+L)*recent mean demand \u2248 733 units to cover the review+lead period demand under the elevated L. I keep sigma_hat at default so the OR backend uses full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). These choices hedge service level against observed 2\u20133 period delays while avoiding extreme overstock given holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Intermittent lead-time regime: concluded lead_times [1,1,2,3] (orders P1\u2192P2, P2\u2192P3, P3\u2192P5, P5\u2192P8); recent average lead_time elevated and variable ~1.75 \u2014 protect against occasional 2\u20133 period delays.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29): on-hand=0, in-transit=502. Recent concludes show intermittent lead-times (1,1,2,3,2) with occasional 2\u20133 period delays; pipeline is large but arrival timing variable. Set L via recent_N to capture elevated/variable lead time and protect against 2\u20133 period delays. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full demand history, keeping demand forecast stable given moderate sample size.

Carry-over insight: Intermittent lead-time regime with occasional 2\u20133 period delays (recent concluded lead_times include 1,1,2,3,2); protect forecasts/orders for L\u22481.5\u20132.0 until arrivals stabilize.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06): demand history shows samples [231,255,302,272,272] (mean\u2248266). Concluded lead times recently show intermittent delays with values [1,1,2,3,2,2]; recent average elevated (~1.8\u20132.0) with last 5 concludes averaging \u22482. To protect service given intermittent 2\u20133 period delays and a large in-transit balance (718), set lead-time estimate using recent_N to reflect current regime. Use recent_N for mu_hat (last 5 demand samples) so forecast weights latest demand; keep sigma_hat default to let backend scale volatility across (1+L). This balances higher pipeline protection (higher L) against holding cost given large in-transit inventory.

Carry-over insight: Intermittent lead-time regime has shifted higher: recent concluded lead_times include 1,1,2,3,2,2; recent average \u22481.8\u20132.0 \u2014 protect forecasts/orders for L\u22482 until arrivals stabilize.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). Recent concluded lead_times show intermittent but rising delays (history includes 1,1,2,3,2,2; recent average \u22481.8\u20132.0). On-hand=0, in-transit=803 \u2014 substantial pipeline but arrivals have been delayed/variable. To protect service against occasional 2\u20133 period delays I set L explicit=2 (aligns with elevated observed regime). Use mu_hat default and sigma_hat default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample set, keeping forecasts conservative while letting backend apply the prescribed safety stock formula.

Carry-over insight: Intermittent lead-time regime shifted higher: recent concluded lead_times include [1,1,2,3,2,2]; recent average \u22481.8\u20132.0 \u2014 treat lead time as ~2 periods until arrivals stabilize.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). Demand history shows low-to-moderate mean (~266 units) but recent concluded lead times have risen and stabilized around ~2 periods (recent concluded lead_times include [1,1,2,3,2,2] \u2192 avg \u22481.8\u20132.0). On-hand=0, in-transit=854 \u2014 substantial pipeline but arrivals have been intermittent and delayed. To protect service given intermittent 2\u20133 period delays, set lead time explicitly to 2 periods so the OR backend orders against a 3-period demand window; use default demand/volatility aggregation so backend applies full-sample mean/std scaled by (1+L). This balances higher safety stock for delayed arrivals versus holding cost given existing large in-transit position.

Carry-over insight: Intermittent lead-time regime has shifted higher: recent concluded lead_times [1,1,2,3,2,2], recent average \u22481.8\u20132.0 \u2192 treat lead time as ~2 periods until arrivals stabilize.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). Recent concluded lead-times show a sustained shift to longer, intermittent delays (recent observed W = [1,1,2,3,2,2] \u2192 avg \u22481.8\u20132.0). On-hand=0, in-transit=1060 units. Using L=2 (explicit) protects against the now-common 2-period delays. Demand has recently softened from early spikes; I base demand sizing on the most recent regime (Periods 11\u201315) to adapt quickly to current demand level. Choosing recent_N N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat uses the latest 5 demands (427,438,267,275,348) so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std for volatility. With L\u22482 the in-transit (1060) roughly covers three periods of recent demand\u2014this avoids over-ordering while protecting service against 2-period lead times.

Carry-over insight: Intermittent lead-time regime has shifted higher; recent concluded lead_times = [1,1,2,3,2,2], recent average \u22481.8\u20132.0 \u2192 treat lead time as ~2 periods until arrivals stabilize.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/3 (Period 17). Historical concluded lead_times show intermittent delays with recent values [1,1,2,3,2,2] (Periods 2,3,5,8,11,14) -> recent average ~1.8\u20132.0. In-transit is large (1114) while on-hand=0; protect against occasional 2\u20133 period delays by treating lead time as \u22482 for forecasting. Use recent_N for L to reflect observed regime (N=6 most recent concluded lead times). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all demand samples, keeping forecasts conservative given elevated L and large pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Intermittent lead-time regime shifted higher: recent concluded lead_times = [1,1,2,3,2,2] (Periods 2,3,5,8,11,14); treat lead time \u22482 periods until arrivals stabilize.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019/6/10). Recent demand history is high and volatile (historical samples mean=266.4, samples=[231,255,302,272,272]). On-hand=24, in-transit=793 \u2014 pipeline is large but arrivals have been intermittent with multiple 2\u20133 period delays in recent concludes. Concluded lead-times show a persistent shift to longer, variable lead times (mostly 1 but frequent 2 and occasional 3), so treat lead time as 2 periods to be conservative. Use default demand aggregation so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean over all samples; use default sigma so backend scales std by sqrt(1+L). This raises target base-stock to cover the longer effective lead time and protect availability while backend caps order size.

Carry-over insight: Intermittent lead-time regime has shifted higher; treat lead time \u22482 periods until arrivals stabilize (evidence: recent concluded lead_times include frequent 2-period and occasional 3-period delays).

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 19 (2019-06-17). On-hand=0, in-transit=1034 \u2014 large pipeline but history shows intermittent 2\u20133 period delays with recent regime shifted higher. To protect service level against the elevated/variable lead time I treat L as 2 periods (explicit).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-08 (Period 22). Recent concluded history shows intermittent but sustained longer lead-times (frequent 2-period delays, occasional 3); pipeline=1027, on-hand=0. To be consistent with promised lead time=2 and the observed elevated/variable lead-time regime, use default L (promised=2) so OR backend assumes L=2. Demand evidence is mixed but no single recent regime changepoint clearly dominates; use default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean of samples) and default volatility to let the OR engine compute base_stock and cap using full sample stats. This balances service (protects against observed 2\u20133 period delays via L=2) while letting backend combine profit/holding tradeoff.

Carry-over insight: Intermittent lead-time regime elevated: recent concluded lead_times include frequent 2-period and occasional 3-period delays; treat effective L\u22482 until arrivals stabilize (evidence: multiple concluded orders with lead_time=2 or 3 across recent periods).

Date 2019/7/15 (Period 23). Recent concluded lead-times show an elevated intermittent regime (frequent 2-period delays with occasional 3-periods); to be conservative treat effective L as 2. On-hand=0, in-transit=1042 \u2014 substantial pipeline but arrivals are delayed/intermittent. Use L explicit=2 to force OR engine to cover (1+L) periods of demand given delayed arrivals. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history, letting the OR formula and cap limit manage service vs holding tradeoff given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime elevated: recent concluded lead_times include frequent 2-period delays and occasional 3-period delays (evidence: multiple concluded orders with lead_time=2 or 3 across recent periods). Treat effective L\u22482 until arrivals stabilize.

LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22). On-hand=0, in-transit=1042. Recent concluded lead-times show frequent 2-period and occasional 3-period delays; effective lead time has shifted higher (~2). To protect service given high in-transit and variable arrivals, set L explicitly to 2 to force the OR engine to cover (1+L) periods. Use default demand and volatility aggregation so backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples (keeps forecasts grounded in full sample while accounting for longer L).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/5 (Period 26). On-hand=0, in-transit=1042. History shows intermittent but now sustained elevated lead times (frequent 2-period delays, occasional 3-periods); to be conservative treat lead time as 2. Use mu_hat and sigma_hat defaults so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history, leveraging all demand data while the system stabilizes. This balances service (protect vs. 2-period delays) with holding cost given large in-transit position.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019/8/12). On-hand=0, in-transit=1042. Historical concluded lead times show persistent elevation and intermittent 3-period delays; recent regime treats effective L\u22482. To protect service vs. holding cost, set lead time explicitly to 2 (treat as elevated/stable). Use default demand/volatility calculations so backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from samples.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime elevated and persistent: recent concluded lead_times include frequent 2-period delays and occasional 3-period delays; treat effective L\u22482 until arrivals stabilize (evidence: multiple concluded orders with lead_time=2 or 3 across recent periods).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=0, in-transit=1042. Historical concluded lead times show a persistent elevated/intermittent regime with frequent 2-period delays and occasional 3-period delays; recent evidence across many concludes supports treating effective L\u22482. To protect service given current pipeline and volatile arrivals, set L explicitly to 2 so mu_hat/sigma_hat base calculations cover (1+L) review+lead demand. Use default demand estimators (all-sample mean/std scaled by (1+L)) so the OR backend applies the proven capped base-stock formula while accounting for the longer effective lead time.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime elevated and persistent: use effective L\u22482 until arrivals stabilize (evidence: multiple concluded orders with lead_time=2 or 3 across recent periods through Period 27).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=0, in-transit=1042. Historical concluded lead-times show a persistent elevated/intermittent regime with frequent 2-period delays and occasional 3-period delays; treat effective lead time as 2 periods to protect against delayed arrivals. Demand has been elevated vs initial seed; use a recent-window demand estimate (most recent 5 periods) to reflect current demand level and volatility. These settings raise the order cover for (1+L) periods while limiting excess inventory from older low-demand samples.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime elevated and persistent: recent concluded lead_times include frequent 2-period delays and occasional 3-period delays; treat effective L\u22482 until arrivals stabilize (evidence through Period 28).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/2 (Period 30). On-hand=0, in-transit=1042. Historical concluded lead_times show persistent elevation with frequent 2-period and occasional 3-period delays through Period 29 \u2192 treat effective lead time as 2. Demand history (samples [231,255,302,272,272]) will be scaled by (1+L). To protect service against intermittent multi-period delays while letting OR backend compute safety stock, set L explicitly to 2 and use default demand/volatility calculations so backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This balances higher replenishment protection given large in-transit volume and elevated lead-time risk.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). Recent concluded lead-times have been elevated and intermittent (frequent 2-period delays, occasional 3-period delays) so treating promised L=2 is appropriate. On-hand=0 with large in-transit=1042 units; pipeline already covers multiple periods of demand so use backend defaults for demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to let the OR engine cap orders appropriately and avoid over-ordering. This balances service (protecting against occasional 2\u20133 period delays) versus holding cost given the existing large pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Large pipeline: in-transit=1042 units at Period 31 start \u2014 sufficient to cover multiple periods; reduce aggressive additional ordering until arrivals confirm instability.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). Demand history shows sustained weekly demand ~250-430 with recent samples consistent; carry-over lead-time regime remains elevated/variable (~2 periods). Large existing pipeline (in-transit=1042) is sufficient to cover multiple periods, so avoid aggressive new orders. Set L explicit=2 to reflect the elevated effective lead time; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes demand over (1+L) periods from full sample history and scales volatility accordingly. This balances service (protect against 2-period delays) while letting the large pipeline deplete before adding more stock.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/23 (Period 33). Demand context: recent observed concluded lead-times have been elevated and intermittent with frequent 2-period and occasional 3-period delays; current in-transit = 1042 units (large pipeline) and on-hand = 0. Given persistent elevation in actual lead time, use the promised/default L (2) to match backend expectation and avoid underestimating lead time. Large pipeline is sufficient to cover multiple periods; avoid aggressive extra ordering. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting the capped policy limit order size against the existing pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime elevated and persistent: treat effective L\u22482 until arrivals stabilize (evidence: multiple concluded orders with lead_time=2 or 3 across recent periods); large pipeline=1042 at Period 31 start \u2014 sufficient to cover multiple periods, reduce aggressive ordering.

This keeps orders conservative given large in-transit volume and elevated holding cost relative to profit.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). Recent demand history (samples: [231,255,302,272,272,287,548,399,338,252,329,415,382,322,308,427,438,267,275,348,370,297,294,334,289,317,313,352,277,256,258,301,294,229,274,254,248,405,312,266]) shows high and variable weekly demand with mean well above zero. On-hand=0 but large in-transit=1042 units (sufficient to cover multiple upcoming periods). Concluded lead-time history has settled around 2 periods recently with occasional 3-periods; promised lead time=2. To avoid overreacting while pipeline clears, use default (promised) lead time and default demand/volatility calculations so the OR backend applies its capped base-stock formula using full sample stats. This reduces unnecessary extra ordering given the large pipeline and aligns with observed elevated effective L\u22482.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/4 (Period 39). Recent concluded lead-times show frequent 2-period delays and occasional 3-periods; effective lead time elevated ~2. On-hand=0, in-transit=1042 (large pipeline sufficient for multiple periods) \u2014 reduce aggressive ordering. Choose L explicit=2 to reflect elevated effective lead time; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from historical demand, balancing service vs holding given high pipeline and moderate holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime elevated and persistent: recent concluded lead_times include frequent 2-period delays and occasional 3-period delays; treat effective L\u22482 until arrivals stabilize. Large pipeline (in-transit=1042) at Period 39 start \u2014 sufficient coverage; avoid aggressive new orders.

Pipeline of 1042 provides multi-period coverage so avoid aggressive new ordering. Use promised/default lead time so backend keeps L=2; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so demand estimates are based on full sample history (stable mean from past demands). This balances service (protecting against frequent 2-period delays) while avoiding extra holding cost given large in-transit inventory.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/02 (Period 43). Demand history shows regular weekly demand (historical seed samples and long history) and recent prolonged arrivals pattern: effective lead-time regime has been elevated and persistent around 2 periods. Current inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=1042 \u2014 large pipeline sufficient to cover multiple periods. To avoid over-ordering while protecting service vs. occasional multi-period delays, set L explicitly to 2 (treat effective lead time as 2). Use default demand aggregation so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean of historical samples for mu_hat and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std for sigma_hat. This keeps orders conservative given large in-transit stock and elevated lead-time, reducing risk of excess holding while maintaining service during intermittent delays.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). Demand history shows multi-period variability with many recent periods of non-arrival but a large in-transit pipeline=1042 units. Concluded lead-time history has recently shifted to an elevated/intermittent regime (~2 periods with occasional 3s); promised L=2 is consistent with observed elevated regime. On-hand=0 but in-transit=1042 provides multi-period coverage, so avoid aggressive topping. I therefore use the promised lead time (default) and let the backend compute mu_hat and sigma_hat from full-sample defaults so ordering is conservative relative to the observed elevated lead-time regime while leveraging the large pipeline to avoid over-ordering.

Lead-time regime has been elevated/persistent around 2 periods; use promised/default lead time to match backend expectation. Use default demand/volatility (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from historical samples) so ordering is driven by pipeline vs. computed base_stock; this avoids aggressive new orders while in-transit stock clears.
