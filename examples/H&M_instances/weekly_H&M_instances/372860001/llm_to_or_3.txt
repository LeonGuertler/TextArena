Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11 (pre-Valentine but product is basic womens socks \u2014 no strong calendar spike expected). No on-hand or in-transit inventory and no concluded arrivals to infer lead-time; historical demands are stable: [231,255,302,272,272] (no clear changepoint). Use promised lead time (default) and let backend compute demand across review+lead using full-sample mean; use default volatility estimate. This balances service (use full-history mean/variance) while avoiding speculative increases given no evidence of a regime shift or lost shipments.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). No concluded arrivals yet (Period 1 order of 310 showed arrived=0) so actual lead time is unobserved; promised lead time (4) remains the appropriate default. Historical demand samples = [231,255,302,272,272] show mean ~266.4; with no calendar shock or recent changepoint signals and on-hand=0, in-transit=310, use default forecasting so OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This keeps parameters consistent with historical demand while respecting promised lead time and avoids overfitting to a single missed arrival.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. On-hand=0, in-transit=621; two recent concluded periods show no arrivals for orders (Period1 and Period2), so no confirmed shorter/longer lead-time yet. Demand history stable (samples [231,255,302,272,272], mean\u2248266.4). I will use promised lead time and default demand estimates so OR backend uses full historical mean/variance over (1+L) review+lead window; this is conservative given missing arrival confirmations and avoids overreacting to possibly lost shipments.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-03-04. Product: womens fine-knit trainer socks; no seasonal event. On-hand=0, in-transit=1108 from prior orders. Orders placed in Periods 1\u20133 (ordered=310,311,487) have not concluded (arrived=0) indicating shipments are delayed beyond the promised L=4. Demand history samples: [231,255,302,272,272], mean=266.4. To be conservative versus lost/delayed shipments, I increase the lead-time estimate to L=5 (one-period longer than promised) so the backend plans for a longer pipeline. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std using all samples \u2014 this balances higher safety stock for delayed arrivals while letting the OR engine compute safety factors from profit/holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Observed sustained shipment delays: orders placed in Periods 1\u20133 (ordered 310/311/487) all show arrived=0 in their conclude messages \u2192 probable lead-time > promised 4; treating as longer-lead regime until arrivals confirm otherwise.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/11. On-hand=0, in-transit=1601 (matches orders 310+311+487+493). Periods 1\u20134 concluded with arrived=0 for those orders \u2192 shipments delayed beyond promised L=4. To avoid underordering while shipments are outstanding, I set a conservative longer lead time. Choose L explicit=6 to cover the observed delay regime; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend scales demand summary ((1+L)\xd7mean, sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) using all historical samples [231,255,302,272,272]. This increases pipeline coverage and trades higher safety-stock vs. holding cost while we confirm arrivals in future concludes.

Carry-over insight: Sustained shipment delays: orders placed in Periods 1\u20134 (310,311,487,493) all still not arrived by Period 4 conclude \u2192 treat current regime as longer lead-time until arrivals confirm; evidence: in-transit=1601 matching outstanding orders; update lead-time estimate upward.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. Recent concludes show the order placed in Period 1 arrived in Period 5 with lead_time=4 (Period5 conclude), confirming promised lead time rather than a longer regime; however a large pipeline remains (in-transit=1775 matching outstanding orders). Demand history provided in environment (samples [231,255,302,272,272]) indicates steady mean ~266.4. Given confirmed lead time = promised 4 and no reliable evidence of a persistent demand shift, use defaults so the OR backend computes base-stock from full-sample mean/variance scaled by (1+L). This balances service (covering 5 periods of demand) against holding cost while letting the backend cap orders by its cap formula.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed at 4 periods: Period 5 conclude showed arrived=310 (ordered Period 1, lead_time=4). Large outstanding pipeline remains (in-transit=1775 matching outstanding orders).

Daily Reward (R_t): $618.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). Recent conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 4 (Period 5 showed arrival of Period 1 order lead_time=4; Period 6 showed arrival of Period 2 order lead_time=4). On-hand=40, in-transit=1464 (large outstanding pipeline matching prior orders). I set L via calculate to use observed lead times (confirmed 4). Demand has recent elevated volatility and a moderate downward shift after earlier spikes; to capture recent regime I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat (uses last 5 demand samples) so base-stock and cap reflect current recent mean and variance while accounting for the confirmed lead-time and large pipeline, balancing service vs holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed at 4 periods (evidence: Period5 conclude arrived=310 ordered Period1 lead_time=4; Period6 conclude arrived=311 ordered Period2 lead_time=4). Large outstanding pipeline persists (in-transit=1464 matching outstanding orders).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Recent conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 4 (Period5: arrived=310 ordered P1 lead_time=4; Period6: arrived=311 ordered P2 lead_time=4; Period7: arrived=487 ordered P3 lead_time=4). On-hand=112, in-transit=1446 (large outstanding pipeline matching past orders). Demand has increased vs older seed samples; recent realized demands (Periods 3\u20137 = 399,338,252,329,415) show a higher mean and elevated volatility. Therefore: set L via calculate to reflect observed lead-times (avg=4); set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture the recent higher-demand regime ((1+L)-scaled mean and sqrt(1+L)-scaled std computed by backend). This balances service level (capture recent demand spike) against holding cost given large pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed at 4 periods; evidence: Period5 conclude arrived=310 (ordered P1, LT=4), Period6 arrived=311 (ordered P2, LT=4), Period7 arrived=487 (ordered P3, LT=4). Large outstanding pipeline persists (in-transit ~1446).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-04-08 (Period 9). Recent conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (arrivals from Orders placed in Periods 1\u20134 all concluded with lead_time=4). On-hand=223, in-transit=1191 \u2014 large pipeline consistent with outstanding orders; no evidence of lost shipments. Recent demand has stepped up vs older samples (recent 5 demands = 338,252,329,415,382; mean\u2248343). To reflect the confirmed LT regime and the higher recent demand, I use the promised/default lead time and base demand estimates on the most recent 5 observations so the OR engine targets a higher base-stock while sigma uses the same recent window to capture current volatility. This balances service (higher mu_hat) against holding cost by relying on recent demand signal rather than the older low-demand history.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed lead-time regime: actual lead time = 4 periods (evidence: Period5\u20138 concludes show arrivals for orders placed in Periods1\u20134 with lead_time=4); large outstanding pipeline (~1191 in-transit) matching orders.

Daily Reward (R_t): $259.00

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15 (Period 10). Recent conclude messages (Periods 5\u20139) consistently show arrivals for orders placed 4 periods earlier (e.g. Period5 arrived order from P1, Period6 from P2, ... Period9 from P5). This confirms actual lead time = 4. On-hand=385, in-transit=1069 (large pipeline matching outstanding orders). Demand history shows no dramatic regime shift beyond samples provided. Use default lead time and default demand/volatility estimates so the OR backend applies (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std across all samples; this leverages confirmed LT=4 and the full sample set to balance service level versus holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time confirmed = 4 periods; evidence: Period5\u20139 conclude messages show arrivals for orders placed in Periods1\u20135 with lead_time=4; pipeline remains large (in-transit ~1069).

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 start: actual lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods (Period5\u201310 concludes show arrivals for orders placed in Periods1\u20136 with lead_time=4). On-hand=77, in-transit=1341 (large pipeline matching outstanding orders). No recent demand regime shift detected in the sample history; use promised/confirmed lead time and default demand/statistics to let OR backend compute base-stock balancing profit vs holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (evidence: Period5\u201310 conclude messages show arrivals for orders placed in Periods1\u20136 with lead_time=4); large outstanding pipeline persists (in-transit ~1341) matching outstanding orders.

Current inventory: on-hand=119, in-transit=1171 (large pipeline). Recent demand has risen and is volatile (demands in concludes: 287,548,399,338,252,329,415,382,322,308,427). I set L to default (promised 4) because concluded history confirms actual LT=4. I use recent_N (N=11) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend forecasts using the full recent realized-demand regime (captures elevated mean and volatility) to balance service (profit $2 vs holding $1) while avoiding excess extra safety from older low-demand samples.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained lead-time regime: actual lead time = 4 periods (evidence: Period5\u201311 conclude messages show arrivals for orders placed 4 periods earlier); large outstanding pipeline persists (in-transit \u22481171 matching outstanding orders).

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). Historical conclude messages (Periods 5\u201312) consistently show arrivals for orders placed four periods earlier; actual lead time confirmed = 4. On-hand=0, in-transit=1433 (large pipeline matching outstanding orders). Use observed lead-time regime to set L via calculation; keep mu_hat and sigma_hat at defaults so backend uses full-sample demand stats scaled by (1+L)=5 \u2014 this balances service (large pipeline + confirmed LT=4) against holding cost given modest profit/holding ratio.

On-hand=95, in-transit=1419 \u2014 large pipeline matching outstanding orders. To respect observed LT regime and let the OR engine use empirical lead-time, set L via observed average. Use default population demand stats for mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history; this balances service (given a large pipeline and confirmed LT=4) against holding cost without overreacting to recent noise.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). Historical conclude messages consistently confirm actual lead time = 4 (arrivals in Periods 5\u201314 correspond to orders placed 4 periods earlier). Large pipeline (in-transit=1393) plus on-hand=92 gives ample coverage but demand remains variable; recent demand has been moderate. Set L to promised/default to align with confirmed 4-period regime. Use mu_hat recent_N with N=5 to ground the (1+L) forecast on the most recent demand regime; sigma_hat default to let the OR engine compute volatility from full history scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances service (maintain coverage given long pipeline and confirmed LT) while avoiding excess holding given $1/period carrying cost.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). Recent conclude messages (Periods 5\u201315) consistently show orders arriving 4 periods after ordering \u2014 actual lead time confirmed = 4. On-hand=43, in-transit=1404 (large pipeline matching outstanding orders). Given confirmed LT=4 and stable demand history, use lead-time estimate from observed arrivals and default demand aggregation over the (1+L) review+lead horizon so the OR backend computes base-stock from the full-sample mean/variance and respects the large pipeline. This balances service (high fill given big pipeline and confirmed LT) against holding cost by relying on backend's cap and standard uncertainty sizing.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained lead-time regime: actual lead time = 4 periods (evidence: conclude messages Periods 5\u201315 show arrivals for orders placed 4 periods earlier); persistent large in-transit pipeline (~1400+).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03 (Period 17). Demand context: product = womens socks; steady historical samples with moderate demand. Recent conclude messages (Periods 5\u201316) consistently show orders arriving with lead_time=4 \u2014 actual lead time confirmed at 4 periods and a large persistent in-transit pipeline (~1200). On-hand=173, in-transit=1201. Given confirmed LT=4 and no recent regime change in demand, use default lead-time and default demand statistics so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7sample mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7sample std across all samples. This keeps orders aligned with observed 4-period lead time and leverages full-sample stability to balance service level versus holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time confirmed = 4 periods (evidence: Periods 5\u201316 conclude messages show arrivals for orders placed 4 periods earlier); persistent large in-transit pipeline (~1200) matching outstanding orders.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-06-10 (Period 18). History shows consistent confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (conclude messages Periods 5\u201317 show arrivals for orders placed 4 periods earlier). On-hand=224, in-transit=1231 (large pipeline matching outstanding orders). Demand samples seed present; no recent demand regime shift evident. To align with confirmed LT and stable demand, use default lead time (promised) and default demand aggregation: let backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This keeps the OR engine calibrated to the verified 4-period lead time and historical demand variability while avoiding overreaction to pipeline noise.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained lead-time regime: actual lead time = 4 periods (evidence: conclude messages Periods 5\u201317 show arrivals for orders placed 4 periods earlier); persistent large in-transit pipeline (~1200+ units) matching outstanding orders.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:

Current inventory: on-hand=176, in-transit=1271 \u2014 large pipeline matching outstanding orders. Demand history and calendar show no abrupt regime change; continue using standard base-stock inputs so OR backend (which assumes promised lead time) can compute the capped order. Chosen methods: use calculated/default statistics (backend will use promised/observed lead time and full-sample demand moments) to keep policy stable given confirmed LT=4 and large pipeline, avoiding overreaction to pipeline fluctuations.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained actual lead time = 4 periods (evidence: conclude messages Periods 5\u201318 show arrivals for orders placed 4 periods earlier); persistent large in-transit pipeline (~1200+ units) matching outstanding orders.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-22 (Period 24). Demand history shows consistently high weekly demand with recent ending on-hand=127 and in-transit=1234. Concluded arrivals across many periods consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (orders placed 4 periods earlier arrive in conclude messages), and the pipeline volume matches outstanding orders. Given confirmed LT=4 and stable demand regime (no recent changepoint in demand mean), use promised lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend applies its standard base-stock calculation anchored to full-sample stats. This balances service (maintain pipeline to cover L+1 periods) against holding cost by letting the backend compute safety stock from historical mean/variance.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained actual lead time = 4 periods (evidence: conclude messages across Periods 5\u201323 show arrivals for orders placed 4 periods earlier); persistent large in-transit pipeline (~1234) matching outstanding orders.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/29 (Period 25). Actual lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods (conclude messages Periods 5\u201324 show arrivals for orders placed 4 periods earlier). Current inventory: on-hand=183, in-transit=1256 (large pipeline matching outstanding orders). Demand history shows no recent regime shift requiring deviation. To align with confirmed LT and stable demand, use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend uses promised L=4 and population statistics for mu/sigma. This keeps service given the large pipeline while avoiding excess hold costs.

Historical concludes consistently confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (arrivals in Periods 5\u201326 correspond to orders placed 4 periods earlier) and a persistent large pipeline. Given confirmed LT=4 and stable demand history, use the backend defaults so it computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from samples; this keeps the base-stock calculation aligned with observed regime and lets the cap control order size given the large in-transit pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time confirmed = 4 periods (evidence: conclude messages Periods 5\u201326 show arrivals for orders placed 4 periods earlier); persistent large in-transit pipeline (~1175) matching outstanding orders.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:

Current inventory: on-hand=269, in-transit=1113 (large pipeline). Recent demand (Periods 23\u201327) = [352, 277, 256, 258, 301], mean=288.8. To align the OR backend with the observed regime and recent demand, use promised lead time (4) and set demand forecast over review+lead as recent-N to capture the higher recent mean; volatility also from recent-N. This keeps base-stock responsive to the recently elevated demand while recognizing the large pipeline to avoid over-ordering.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26 (Period 29). Historical conclude messages consistently confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (arrivals for orders placed 4 periods earlier appear in concludes). On-hand=330, in-transit=859 matching large outstanding pipeline. Demand history and calendar show no acute regime shift; recent demands have been stable. To align with confirmed lead-time regime and avoid overreacting to pipeline, use default lead time and default demand estimates so OR backend computes base-stock from full-sample mean/variance scaled by (1+L). This balances service-level (profit $2 vs holding $1) while avoiding unnecessary extra stock given large in-transit volumes.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained actual lead time = 4 periods (evidence: conclude messages across Periods 5\u201328 show arrivals for orders placed 4 periods earlier); persistent large in-transit pipeline (~859 current, historically ~1100\u20131400) matching outstanding orders.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). Many conclude messages across Periods 5\u201329 confirm actual lead time = 4 periods; pipeline remains large (On-hand=368, In-transit=1024). Demand has been stable ~230\u2013380 recently. Use observed lead-time avg to set L; use a short recent window for demand to capture the current regime while avoiding overreacting to older samples. This balances service (keep coverage for 1+L periods given long but stable lead time) against holding cost by relying on recent demand for mu_hat and default volatility for sigma_hat.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained actual lead time = 4 periods (evidence: conclude messages Periods 5\u201329 show arrivals for orders placed 4 periods earlier); persistent large in-transit pipeline (~1,000\u20131,400) matching outstanding orders.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-09 (Period 31). Demand context: product is basic women's socks; historical sample mean = 266.4 (samples [231,255,302,272,272]). Actual lead time has been consistently observed = 4 periods in conclude messages across many past periods; current on-hand=338 and in-transit=792 which matches outstanding pipeline. No recent changepoint in demand or lead time. I therefore use default lead time (promised 4, confirmed by history) and default demand aggregation (mu_hat and sigma_hat) so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from full sample set. This keeps the base-stock anchored to long-run demand while the backend's cap limits over-ordering given the large existing pipeline, balancing service level (profit>$ holding cost) against holding costs.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-16 (Period 32). Demand has been stable mid-200s\u2013300s historically; recent concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 (arrivals consistently match orders placed 4 periods earlier). On-hand=331 and in-transit=973 (large pipeline ~1,304 total supply) \u2014 pipeline matches outstanding orders so no evidence of lost shipments. Using promised/default lead time and default demand estimates lets the OR backend apply its standard base-stock calculation given the confirmed LT and historical samples; this balances service (avoid stockouts given steady demand and long pipeline) against holding cost by not inflating explicit forecasts.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained actual lead time = 4 periods (evidence: conclude messages across Periods 5\u201331 consistently show arrivals for orders placed 4 periods earlier); large persistent in-transit pipeline (~900\u20131400) matching outstanding orders.

Given confirmed LT regime and no new seasonality signal, use promised/confirmed lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend uses the full-sample mean/SD anchored to L=4. This keeps ordering aligned with observed long-run demand while the large in-transit pipeline reduces immediate ordering urgency and avoids excess holding cost.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). Product: womens fine-knit trainer socks; recent demand history shows steady weekly demand with no abrupt seasonal spike. On-hand=162, in-transit=1219 (large persistent pipeline). Historical conclude messages consistently confirm actual lead time = 4 periods. Given confirmed LT=4 and a large, stable pipeline, use the promised/confirmed lead time and population-level demand estimates to avoid overreacting to short-term noise: select L=default (promised 4), mu_hat=default (use all-sample mean scaled by 1+L) and sigma_hat=default (use all-sample std scaled by sqrt(1+L)). This balances service (high pipeline + confirmed LT) against holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time confirmed = 4 periods (evidence: conclude messages across Periods 5\u201335 consistently show arrivals for orders placed 4 periods earlier); persistent large in-transit pipeline \u22481200 matching outstanding orders.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21 (Period 37). Historical conclude messages (Periods 5\u201336) consistently show orders arriving 4 periods after ordering \u2014 actual lead time confirmed at 4. Current inventory: on-hand=263, in-transit=1137 (large pipeline matching outstanding orders). Demand history and seasonal context (women's trainer socks, autumn timeframe) show steady weekly demand; no recent changepoint in demand mean/variance. To keep the OR engine aligned with observed regime and avoid overreaction to pipeline noise, use default lead time (promised = 4) and default demand mean/volatility calculations so the backend computes base_stock = (1+L)\xd7mean and sigma = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample set. This balances service (capitalize on large pipeline arrivals) against holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained actual lead time = 4 periods (evidence: conclude messages Periods 5\u201336 show arrivals for orders placed 4 periods earlier); persistent large in-transit pipeline (~1137 currently) matching outstanding orders.

No new calendar-driven spike. Given confirmed LT=4 and stable demand samples, use the promised/default lead time and let the OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the seed samples so the capped ordering cap is respected. This keeps service level appropriate while limiting extra holding given $1 holding vs $2 profit.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). Historical demand samples steady (past demands [231,255,302,272,272], mean=266.4). Actual lead time has been consistently 4 periods (conclude messages across Periods 5\u201338 confirm arrivals for orders placed 4 periods earlier). Current inventory: on-hand=337, in-transit=1017 (total supply=1354) which aligns with a 5-period coverage \u2248 5\xd7mean demand (5\xd7266.4\u22481332). Given the stable demand regime and long-confirmed lead time, use the defaults so the OR backend applies the standard (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std calculations. This balances service level (covering L+1 periods) against holding cost while leveraging observed steady variability.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained actual lead time = 4 periods (evidence: conclude messages across Periods 5\u201338 consistently show arrivals for orders placed 4 periods earlier).

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/11 (Period 40). Historical conclude messages consistently confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (arrivals in Periods 5\u201339 map to orders placed 4 periods earlier). Current inventory: on-hand=318, in-transit=1066 \u2014 a large pipeline matching outstanding orders. Demand history shows stable weekly demand with no strong calendar spike for this socks SKU. Given the confirmed LT=4 and stable demand, use the promised/default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend applies its standard (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility over full history; this balances service level (profit > holding cost) while avoiding unnecessary extra safety stock against an already-large pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained actual lead time = 4 periods (evidence: conclude messages Periods 5\u201339 show arrivals for orders placed 4 periods earlier); persistent large in-transit pipeline (~1000\u20131400) matching outstanding orders.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:

Pipeline remains large (in-transit=1040) and on-hand=325. No new evidence of lead-time drift or demand regime change; recent demand history is stable. I therefore use the promised/default lead time and let the OR backend compute mu_hat and sigma_hat from the full sample set so the engine's base-stock calculation aligns with observed steady LT and aggregate demand statistics.

Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (arrivals for orders placed 4 periods earlier from Periods 5\u201341).

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). On-hand=439, in-transit=912. Historical conclude messages consistently confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (arrivals for orders placed 4 periods earlier across many concludes). Pipeline is large but matches outstanding orders. I therefore use the promised/confirmed lead time and full-sample demand statistics so the OR backend applies its standard base-stock calculation using all historical demand data. This balances service (use observed LT=4) vs holding cost by letting the OR engine compute safety stock from full-sample mean/variance.
