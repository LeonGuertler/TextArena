No evidence of delays or lost shipments yet, so assume uncertainty; be conservative but responsive. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, In-transit=0. Current period demand will occur after decision; because actual lead time is uncertain (could be 0), we need inventory to meet expected single-period demand. e) Final order logic: target to cover expected demand for this period using the historical mean (\u2248266). Ordering 266 balances capturing expected profitable sales (Profit $4/unit) against holding cost ($1/unit/period) given no evidence of regime/lead-time shifts.",
