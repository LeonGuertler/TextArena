======================================================================


Period 1 (2019/2/25) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
(1) Historical pattern summary: past demands = [61, 98, 152, 129, 213]. Overall range 61\u2013213 with a general upward tendency but some volatility. Mean of last 3 periods = 164.7. (2) Seasonal/calendar considerations: Current date 2019-02-25 \u2014 approaching spring in Northern Hemisphere where swimwear demand typically rises toward late spring/summer; expect upward pressure. (3) Recent trend analysis: recent values show strong increase from earlier periods, but one dip at period 4 (129) creates volatility; no multiperiod stable regime change evident. (4) Final forecast logic: use recent-period average (last 3 = 164.7) and apply modest seasonal uplift (~10%) for approaching swimwear season => forecast ~181 (rounded).

Period 2 (2019/3/4) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
1) Historical pattern summary: Training demands = [61,98,152,129,213] show overall upward movement with volatility; 5-period mean = 150.6 and recent training average (last 3) = (152+129+213)/3 = 164.7. 2) Seasonal/calendar considerations: Current date 2019-03-04 (early March) precedes spring/summer swimwear season\u2014expect rising demand into spring. 3) Recent trend analysis: Test Period1 observed demand = 175, above the training mean and above recent training avg, supporting a continuation of higher demand. 4) Final forecast logic: Weight recent observation (175) more than long-run mean; combine recent level and seasonal uplift to produce a modest increase. Forecast rounded to integer.

Period 3 (2019/3/11) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
(1) Historical pattern summary: Training demands = [61, 98, 152, 129, 213] show variability with an overall upward move into the last training period (213). (2) Seasonal/calendar considerations: Product is women's swimwear; early March (2019/3/11) is transition into spring in many markets, supporting stable-to-rising demand ahead of peak swim season. (3) Recent trend analysis: Test-phase observed demands are 175 (2019/2/25) and 173 (2019/3/4) \u2014 two very consistent, slightly declining observations around 174. No 3+ period sustained change yet. (4) Final forecast logic: weight recent observations heavily; use their mean (174) as the next-period forecast, adjusted minimally for seasonal uplift but conservatively given limited data.

Period 4 (2019/3/18) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
(1) Historical pattern summary: Training avg = 130.6 (periods before test: [61,98,152,129,213]); test observations show much higher levels. (2) Seasonal/calendar: Product is swimwear and current date 2019-03-18 is late winter/early spring in Northern Hemisphere \u2014 demand rising ahead of spring/summer. (3) Recent trend analysis: Test periods 1-3 (2019/2/25\u20132019/3/11) are stable-to-slightly-up around avg 176.3 (175,173,181), indicating a new higher regime versus training. (4) Final forecast logic: weight recent test mean heavily while accounting for small upward momentum and seasonal increase \u2192 forecast near recent mean slightly up.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 1 (2019/2/25): avg increased from 130.6 (training periods) to 176.3 (2019/2/25\u20132019/3/11) (+35%).

Period 5 (2019/3/25) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
(1) Historical pattern: training demands [61,98,152,129,213] have mean ~130.6 but high variability. (2) Calendar: current date 2019/3/25 \u2014 late March, seasonal increase for swimwear heading into spring/summer in Northern Hemisphere likely supports higher demand. (3) Recent trend: test-phase observed demands show a sustained higher regime: 175,173,181,200 (avg 182.25) with a slight upward trajectory. (4) Forecast logic: weigh recent four-period average and modest continuation of upward momentum given seasonality; produce a slightly above-average recent value.

Period 6 (2019/4/1) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
(1) Historical pattern summary: Training demands were [61,98,152,129,213] showing moderate variability; recent test-period demands are much higher: [175,173,181,200,268]. (2) Seasonal/calendar considerations: Product is womens swimwear and current date is 2019-04-01 \u2014 demand typically rises entering spring/summer, supporting upward pressure. (3) Recent trend analysis: consecutive elevated periods with an accelerating increase (period deltas: -2, +8, +19, +68). 3- and 5-period averages: last3_avg=216, last5_avg=199; linear recent average increment \u2248 +23 units/period. (4) Final forecast logic: weigh recent acceleration and seasonality more heavily while moderating single-period spike; project next period as last observed 268 plus a conservative increment (~27), yielding 295.

Carry-over insight: Upward demand trend confirmed for test periods 2019/2/25\u20132019/3/25: avg increased to 199.4 (5-period avg) from prior observed short-term avg 176.3 (+13%), sustained over 5 consecutive periods.

(2) Calendar/seasonality: Product is swimwear; early April marks ramp into spring/summer season, supporting rising demand. (3) Recent trend analysis: demand acceleration evident \u2014 week-over-week changes: -2, +8, +19, +68, +108; recent growth rates for last three transitions: +10.5%, +34.0%, +40.3% (avg \u2248 28%). (4) Forecast logic: apply conservative version of recent growth to last observed demand (376) using ~28% uplift, rounded to integer. Predicted demand = 480.

Period 8 (2019/4/15) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
(1) Historical summary: Training mean = 130.6 (periods: 61,98,152,129,213). Test observations show a clear upward shift vs training: Periods 1\u20137 = [175,173,181,200,268,376,295]. (2) Calendar/seasonality: Product is swimwear and current date 2019-04-15 is spring heading into peak swim season => demand uplift expected. (3) Recent trend analysis: demand accelerated beginning in test period 1 and intensified after period 3. Recent 3-period avg (P5\u2013P7) = (268+376+295)/3 = 313; recent 5-period avg (P3\u2013P7) = 264, both well above earlier short-term avg ~199.4. Variability is high but trend is upward. (4) Forecast logic: weigh recent observations more (60% on 3-period avg, 40% on 5-period avg) and account for seasonal uplift => forecast = round(0.6*313 + 0.4*264) = 310.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime further increased starting ~Period 3 (2019/3/11): 5-period avg (P3\u2013P7) = 264 vs prior short-term avg 199.4 (+32%), sustained over 5 consecutive periods.

Period 10 (2019/4/29) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
(1) Historical summary: Training demands were low (61,98,152,129,213) then test periods show much higher levels. (2) Calendar/seasonality: Product is swimwear; late April ahead of peak season (May\u2013Aug) supports rising demand. (3) Recent trend: Test P1\u2013P9 show a strong upward regime: P5\u2013P9 = [268,376,295,367,477], 5-period avg = 356.6 and average period-to-period change \u2248 +27.3. (4) Forecast logic: combine recent mean (356.6), positive short-term momentum (+27 per period), and seasonal strength \u2192 projected next period demand \u2248 477 + 27 \u2248 504.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime further increased starting Period 5: 5-period avg (P5\u2013P9) = 356.6 vs prior 5-period avg 264 (+35%), sustained over 5 consecutive periods.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
(1) Historical pattern summary: Training demands: [61,98,152,129,213] show low baseline. Test periods show a clear uplift vs training: P1\u2013P10 = [175,173,181,200,268,376,295,367,477,468]. (2) Seasonal/calendar: Current date 2019/5/6 \u2014 swimwear demand rises entering spring/summer and around late-spring promotional activity, supporting higher demand. (3) Recent trend analysis: Strong upward regime vs earlier periods. 5-period avg P6\u2013P10 = 396.6, 5-period avg P1\u2013P5 = 199.4 (+99%). Recent two periods (P9,P10) = 477,468 indicate a high, slightly volatile plateau. (4) Final forecast logic: Use recent 5-period average with slight weighting toward latest observations (to reflect sustained high demand), producing an integer forecast near 397.

Period 12 (2019/5/13) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
(1) Historical pattern summary: Training demands = [61,98,152,129,213] show overall growth into test phase. Test periods 1\u201311 show a clear upward regime beginning Period 5 with high volatility: [175,173,181,200,268,376,295,367,477,468,332]. (2) Seasonal/calendar considerations: Current date 2019-05-13 is late spring approaching summer in the Northern Hemisphere \u2014 swimwear demand typically rises into May/June, supporting higher near-term demand. (3) Recent trend analysis: Recent 5-period average (Periods 7\u201311) = 387.8, which is above the prior 5-period avg (Periods 5\u20139 = 356.6). Demand is elevated but volatile (peaks 477/468, trough 295/332). (4) Final forecast logic: weight recent 5-period average with slight conservatism due to last-period drop (332). Using the recent avg 387.8 rounded and tempering downward modestly yields a forecast of 388.

Test-period behavior shows a clear upward shift vs training with larger magnitudes (Periods 1\u201312 mainly 175\u2013477). (2) Seasonal/calendar considerations: Product is swimwear; current date 2019-05-20 is late spring approaching summer in Northern Hemisphere, supporting sustained high demand. (3) Recent trend analysis: Last 5 test periods (P8\u2013P12) = [367,477,468,332,417], 5-period average = 412.2 with volatility but no clear reversal; last three = [468,332,417] average = 405.7.

Period 14 (2019/5/27) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
(1) Historical pattern summary: training data shows a rising baseline (61,98,152,129,213) and test phase exhibits a clear step-up from Period 5 onward with high variability. (2) Seasonal/calendar: current date 2019/5/27 is late May approaching peak swim season (memorial day/weekend effects), supporting sustained elevated demand for swimwear. (3) Recent trend analysis: recent observations P9\u2013P13 = [477,468,332,417,370], 5-period average = 412.8, last 3-period average (P11\u2013P13) = 373, showing elevated but volatile demand. (4) Final forecast logic: weight recent average more heavily but account for seasonal lift; choose a conservative midpoint between 5-period avg and 3-period avg with slight upward seasonal bias => round( (412.8 + 373)/2 * 1.03 ) \u2248 400.

Period 15 (2019/6/3) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
1) Historical pattern: Training demands were low (61,98,152,129,213) then test period shows a large upward shift starting Period1 with sustained higher means. 2) Calendar/seasonality: Product is swimwear and current date is 2019-06-03 (start of summer in Northern Hemisphere) \u2014 seasonal demand is expected to be rising. 3) Recent trend: Recent observations show elevated, volatile but generally increasing demand. Last 5 periods (P10\u2013P14) = [468,332,417,370,525], 5-period avg = 422.4; last 3-period avg (P12\u2013P14) = 437.3 indicating short-term uptick. 4) Forecast logic: give weight to most recent 3 periods while accounting for volatility and seasonal uplift, produce a rounded integer near the 3-period average.

Carry-over insight: Elevated demand regime persists: Period10 (2019/4/29)\u2013Period14 (2019/5/27) 5-period avg = 422.4 vs prior 5-period avg 356.6 (+18%), sustained over 5 consecutive periods.

(2) Seasonal/calendar considerations: Product is swimwear; current date 2019/6/10 is start of summer in Northern Hemisphere, supportive of sustained high demand. (3) Recent trend analysis: Recent test demands (P11\u2013P15) = [332,417,370,525,330], 5-period avg = 394.8; last 3 avg = 408.3. Demand remains in elevated regime established earlier but is volatile week-to-week. (4) Final forecast logic: Combine recent 5-period average with slight upward seasonal bias for early June; round to nearest integer.

Period 20 (2019/7/8) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
(1) Historical pattern: training demands = [61,98,152,129,213] show rising baseline into test. Test phase shows clear upward regime vs training. (2) Calendar/world: current date 2019/7/8 \u2014 peak summer season for swimwear, supporting elevated demand. (3) Recent trend: last 5 test periods (P15\u2013P19) avg = 502.4; last 3 periods (P17\u2013P19) avg = 626.7, indicating a recent spike. (4) Forecast logic: weight recent weeks more due to seasonality and clear spike; use the 3-week average as primary signal tempered slightly toward 5-week mean. Calculation: round(0.7*626.7 + 0.3*502.4) = 625 (approx).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime increase starting Period 17 (2019/6/17): avg P17\u2013P19 = 626.7 vs prior 5-period avg 422.4 (+48%), sustained over 3 consecutive periods.

(2) Seasonal/calendar: Product is swimwear and current date 2019/7/15 is peak summer season in Northern Hemisphere \u2014 supports elevated demand. (3) Recent trend: Periods 17\u201320 = [517,771,592,542], 4-period average = 605.5; recent values show high but variable summer peak. (4) Forecast logic: weight recent 4-period average heavily while conservatively smoothing for variability and uncertainty; round to integer.

Period 22 (2019/7/22) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
(1) Historical pattern: training series low (61\u2013213) then test periods show multiple upward regime shifts culminating in much higher weekly demand since Period 5; recent test history (P17\u2013P21 = 517, 771, 592, 542, 510) avg = 586.4. (2) Calendar: current date 2019/7/22 is peak summer for swimwear (seasonally strong demand). (3) Recent trend: after a peak at P18 (771) demand has softened over the last three weeks (P19\u2013P21 avg = 548), suggesting a mild short-term cooling from the very high spike. (4) Forecast logic: combine recent 3-week downward signal with 5-week elevated regime mean and summer seasonal strength; lean toward the recent 3-week average while preserving elevated regime baseline.

LLM Rationale:
(1) historical pattern summary: training demands show rising trend [61,98,152,129,213] then test phase exhibits multiple upward regime shifts with recent high summer demand for swimwear. (2) seasonal/calendar considerations: current date 2019/7/29 is peak summer for swimwear in Northern Hemisphere -> elevated baseline. (3) recent trend analysis: Periods 17\u201322 average = 607; 5-period avg (P18\u2013P22) = 625; most recent 3-period avg (P20\u2013P22) = 587 \u2014 demand remains elevated and volatile but no sharp drop. (4) final forecast logic: weight recent 6-period average and summer seasonal uplift, lean slightly toward the 5-period average for stability -> forecast = 610.

Period 24 (2019/8/5) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
1) Historical pattern: training demands rose from 61 to 213 showing strong growth; test phase shows a clear elevated summer regime with many weeks >500. 2) Calendar: Current date 2019/8/05 is peak Northern Hemisphere summer\u2014swimwear demand expected high. 3) Recent trend: Periods 17\u201322 average = 607 (517,771,592,542,510,710); Period 23 dropped to 309 (likely an outlier/week-specific dip). 4) Forecast logic: given sustained elevated regime since Period 17 and seasonal peak, downweight the single low week 23 and use recent high-regime average (periods 18\u201322 avg \u2248 625) to predict next period. Predicted demand rounded to nearest integer.

Period 25 (2019/8/12) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
(1) Historical summary: Training avg low (~130) but test periods show a sustained elevated summer regime with multiple spikes (peaks in June\u2013July). (2) Calendar: Product is swimwear; peak season is late spring\u2013mid summer. Current date 2019/8/12 is post-peak summer where demand typically declines. (3) Recent trend: Periods 17\u201322 showed high sustained demand (517\u2013710), then a sharp drop in Periods 23\u201324 (309, 176) indicating a rapid post-peak decline but only two low observations so far. (4) Forecast logic: weigh most recent observations more heavily given rapid decline and seasonal tail-off; average of last 2 periods = 242.5, tempered slightly downward for continued summer decline -> 230 (rounded integer).

Period 26 (2019/8/19) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
1) Historical pattern summary: Training demands: [61,98,152,129,213]. Test-phase shows several regime shifts: large mid-spring and early-summer peaks (Periods 5\u201322) then a sharp drop in late July\u2013Aug. 2) Seasonal/calendar considerations: Product is swimwear; demand peaks in late spring/early summer (May\u2013July). By mid-late August (2019/8/19) seasonality and post-peak decline expected. 3) Recent trend analysis: Periods 22\u201325 = [710,309,176,132] show a rapid decline; last 3 periods (P23\u2013P25) average = 205.7, much lower than prior summer average (P18\u2013P22 avg \u2248 625.4). 4) Final forecast logic: Given swimwear seasonality (downtrend in mid-August), and strong evidence of a new lower demand regime over the last 3 periods, weigh recent 3-period average more heavily while being slightly conservative toward the most recent low. Forecast set near the recent 3-period avg but pulled toward the last two observations.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease starting Period 23 (2019/7/29): avg P23\u2013P25 = 205.7 vs prior P18\u2013P22 avg = 625.4 (\u221267%), sustained over 3 consecutive periods.

Period 27 (2019/8/26) LLM Demand Forecast:

LLM Rationale:
1) Historical summary: training demands ranged 61\u2013213 with test phase showing large seasonal spike in late spring/early summer (peaks up to 771) then sharp decline starting Period 23. 2) Calendar/seasonal: product is swimwear; peak demand occurred in June\u2013July (Periods 15\u201322). By late August (Period 27) seasonal demand typically falls. 3) Recent trend: Periods 23\u201326 = [309,176,132,155], showing a rapid drop and stabilization at a lower level; 3-period avg (P24\u2013P26)=154, 4-period avg=193. 4) Forecast logic: weight most recent periods more heavily and assume the lower post-peak regime persists for late-August. Balance between 3- and 4-period averages => forecast ~165.

(2) Calendar/world: Current date 2019-09-02 (early September) is off-peak for womens swimwear in Northern Hemisphere after summer; expect lower demand. (3) Recent trend: Periods 23\u201327 = [309,176,132,155,139], 5-period avg = 182.2 and a downshift from prior summer highs; the decline is sustained across 5 periods.

(2) Calendar: Current date 2019/9/9 is post-summer/early Sept when swimwear demand typically falls. No major retail event to boost demand. (3) Recent trend: Last 6 test periods show sustained decline from 309 (P23) to 78 (P28), recent three-point sequence 155,139,78 indicates accelerating drop. (4) Forecast logic: weight recent observations heavily due to clear post-season downtrend; project continuation of low post-season demand with modest further decline from 78 -> forecast ~60.

Period 30 (2019/9/16) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
(1) Historical pattern: training demands [61,98,152,129,213] show low-to-moderate baseline; test periods exhibited a strong spring\u2192summer rise with peaks in June\u2013July and a sharp post-summer collapse. (2) Calendar/world knowledge: product is womens swimwear \u2014 peak demand in late spring/summer, large drop expected entering Sept. Current date 2019/9/16 is post-summer, consistent with seasonal decline. (3) Recent trend: Periods 23\u201329 show sustained low demand (309,176,132,155,139,78,65) \u2014 7 consecutive low periods; last 3 periods are 139,78,65 indicating continued decline. 3-period avg = 94.

Period 32 (2019/9/30) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
1) Historical pattern: training demands rising [61,98,152,129,213] show overall upward seasonality into summer. 2) Calendar/seasonal: Product is swimwear; demand peaks in late spring/early summer and collapses after summer\u2014current date 2019/9/30 is post-summer. 3) Recent trend: sharp, sustained post-summer collapse starting Period 23 (7/29) with low values P23\u2013P31 = [309,176,132,155,139,78,65,30,35]; most recent three periods = [65,30,35] (avg 43). 4) Forecast logic: rely on recent observations and seasonal collapse; use a near-term average weighted to most recent periods -> predicted demand \u2248 40.

Period 33 (2019/10/7) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
(1) Historical pattern summary: Training demands small (61,98,152,129,213). Test phase shows strong spring/summer peak (peaks up to 771) and a sharp post-summer collapse. (2) Seasonal/calendar considerations: Current date 2019/10/07 is early October \u2014 off-season for womens swimwear in Northern Hemisphere, so low demand expected. (3) Recent trend analysis: Periods 28\u201332 = [78,65,30,35,62], 5-period avg = 54, showing sustained low demand since late Aug/Sept. No evidence of renewed summer demand. (4) Final forecast logic: Weight recent 5-period average heavily due to clear regime change to low post-season demand; round to nearest whole unit.

(2) Calendar/world knowledge: Current date 2019/10/14 is autumn \u2014 out of swim season, so low baseline demand expected. (3) Recent trend: Periods 28\u201333 = [78,65,30,35,62,38], 6-period avg = 51.3; most recent 3-period avg (P31\u2013P33) = 45.

Period 38 (2019/11/11) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
(1) Historical summary: Training demands [61,98,152,129,213] show upward early variability; test phase shows strong seasonality with peaks in spring/summer and collapse post-summer. (2) Calendar: Current date 2019/11/11 is late autumn in northern hemisphere; swimwear demand is low. No major retail holiday for swimwear that would raise demand. (3) Recent trend: Periods 30\u201337 = [30,35,62,38,43,50,36,34], avg = 41, stable low demand over 8 consecutive periods after the summer collapse. (4) Forecast logic: Given sustained low post-season regime and no seasonal drivers to increase demand, project next period near recent mean (rounding to integer).

Carry-over insight: Post-summer deeper low starting Period 30: avg P30\u2013P37 = 41.0 vs prior P23\u2013P29 avg = 150.6 (\u221273%), sustained over 8 consecutive periods.

(2) Calendar: current date 2019/12/2 \u2014 swimwear out-of-season in Northern Hemisphere; recent retail events (Black Friday/Thanksgiving) likely caused P40 spike (113). No major December swimwear demand drivers expected. (3) Recent trend: last 8 periods show low baseline with one isolated spike at P40; no sustained recovery (P30\u2013P39 avg \u224841). P40 likely promotional outlier. (4) Forecast logic: revert to post-summer low with small uplift possibility vs P30\u2013P39 baseline due to holiday spillover; forecast near that baseline rounded to integer.

(2) Calendar/world: Current date 2019/12/9 \u2014 early December; swimwear is highly seasonal with low baseline in late fall/early winter. Black Friday/Cyber Monday can cause single-week uplifts (observed Period 40 spike = 113). No major sustained December uplift expected for swim bottoms. (3) Recent trend: last five periods = [34,42,17,113,51] are volatile; excluding the isolated Black Friday spike, recent median/mean centers ~40\u201360. No sustained regime change (needs 3+ consecutive periods). (4) Forecast logic: weight very recent data, downweight the single promotional spike (P40). Use average of last three (17,113,51 = 60.3) and round to integer, yielding a conservative near-term forecast consistent with post-summer low seasonality.

Period 43 (2019/12/16) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
(1) Historical pattern: strong summer peak (Periods ~17\u201322) then sharp post-summer collapse into low baseline (~30\u201360 units) from Period 30 onward with occasional short spikes. (2) Calendar: current date 2019-12-16 \u2014 winter/holiday period for swimwear (off-season), limited upside except promotional spikes (e.g., late-Nov Black Friday). (3) Recent trend: last four periods = [17, 113, 51, 57], 4-period mean = 59.5; the 113 value appears a short promotional spike (not sustained). Baseline since Period 30 is low and stable. (4) Forecast logic: weigh recent baseline more than the isolated spike and apply seasonal off-season expectation -> predict near recent baseline around 60 units.

Period 44 (2019/12/23) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
1) Historical pattern summary: Training and early test show strong seasonality with peak swimwear demand in spring/summer (peaks up to 771) and deep post-summer/late-year lows (many weeks <100). 2) Seasonal/calendar considerations: Current date 2019/12/23 is in winter/holiday period for Northern Hemisphere \u2014 swim bottoms typically see very low demand; no major swim-related event. 3) Recent trend analysis: Last weeks show stabilized low demand after a brief November spike: P40\u2013P43 = [113,51,57,58]; the three most recent weeks (P41\u2013P43) average ~55.3, indicating a steady low regime. 4) Final forecast logic: Use short-term recent average (more weight to last 3 periods) given recent regime stability and calendar seasonality -> round to nearest integer.

Period 45 (2019/12/30) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
(1) Historical pattern: strong seasonal summer peaks (periods ~17\u201322) with post-summer collapse to low levels from Period 30 onward; overall training values low-to-moderate but test shows clear summer regime then sustained off-season low. (2) Calendar: Current date 2019/12/30 \u2014 winter season for swimwear in Northern Hemisphere, typically low demand; no major retail event boosting swimwear at year-end. (3) Recent trend: Periods 41\u201344 = [51,57,58,57] stable around mid-50s after an isolated Period 40 spike (113). (4) Forecast logic: use short-term recent average as best predictor in a stable low regime. Predicted demand = round(mean(51,57,58,57)) = 56.
