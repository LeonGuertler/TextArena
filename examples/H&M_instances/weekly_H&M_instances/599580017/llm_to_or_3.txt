Period 1 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical demands: [61,98,152,129,213] \u2014 recent uptick (last 3: 152,129,213) suggests higher short-term demand (spring swim season). Promised lead time=4 used (method: default) because no concluded arrivals to estimate actual lead time. To capture the upward shift I set mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) so the OR engine builds base stock around the most recent higher mean; sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent volatility. This balances service (avoid stockouts into swim season) against holding cost given modest per-unit profit ($2) vs holding ($1).

Carry-over insight: Upward demand regime detected in most recent 3 periods: mean_recent3=~164.7 (samples 152,129,213); treat as sustained short-term increase until contradicted by future concludes.

Period 2 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/4. Recent demand shows an upward regime in the latest 3 samples (152,129,213 => mean ~164.7). Period 1 conclude shows the order placed (237) did not arrive yet (arrived=0), so actual lead time is not yet observable; could be >=1 or shipment delayed. Use promised lead time (default L=4) because no concluded arrivals exist to compute an empirical lead time. For demand forecasting, use recent_N (N=3) to capture the detected short-term upward shift; apply same recent_N=3 for sigma to reflect increased volatility in the newer regime. Current in-transit=237 provides cushion vs. (1+L)-period demand under the elevated short-term forecast, so parameters prioritize service level while avoiding excess additional ordering until lead-time is confirmed by future concludes.

Carry-over insight: Upward demand regime detected in most recent 3 periods: mean_recent3\u2248164.7 (samples 152,129,213); treat as sustained short-term increase until contradicted by future concludes.

Period 3 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. On-hand=0, in-transit=479, recent demands show an upward regime (last 3 samples 152,129,213; mean\u2248164.7). No concluded arrivals yet (orders from Periods 1\u20132 remain unconfirmed), so do not change lead time estimate. Use L=default (promised 4). To capture the recent upward shift, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 (use last 3 samples) so OR backend sizes base-stock to the higher short-term demand while keeping lead time assumption unchanged. This balances higher service level for the observed demand spike against holding cost and flags outstanding in-transit stock for future confirmation.

Period 4 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-03-18 (Period 4). On-hand=0, in-transit=704; three consecutive conclude messages show arrived=0 for orders placed in Periods 1-3 -> suggests shipments delayed/lost and actual lead time > promised. Demand recent regime increased (last 3 historical samples 152,129,213 mean\u2248164.7). Set L explicitly longer than promised to guard against further unseen delays. Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the detected short-term upward demand regime. Keep sigma_hat default to reflect full-sample volatility scaled by chosen L.

Carry-over insight: Upward demand regime in most recent 3 periods (samples 152,129,213), mean_recent3\u2248164.7; treat as sustained short-term increase until contradicted.

Period 5 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-25): recent demand shows an upward regime (most recent 3 demands = 152,129,213; mean_recent3\u2248164.7). On-hand=0 but in-transit=962 (sum of prior orders 237+242+225+258) which covers multiple review+lead periods. No concluded arrivals yet, so cannot infer a shorter/longer actual lead time from concludes; use promised lead time. Set L to default (promised=4). Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the detected short-term demand increase. Use recent_N (N=3) for sigma_hat to reflect volatility in the same recent window. This balances higher service level for the uptick while relying on a large in-transit pipeline to limit extra ordering and holding cost.

Period 6 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-04-01). Recent demand has accelerated: last 3 concluded demands = [181,200,268] (mean\u2248216). One observed lead time (order on P1 arrived in P5) = 4, matching promised L=4. On-hand=0, in-transit=725 \u2014 substantial pipeline but arrival timing uncertain across multiple orders; maintain lead time=4. To respond to sustained upward demand, set mu_hat using the most recent 3 periods (captures upward shift) and set sigma_hat from the same window to reflect increased variability. These parameters raise the base-stock to improve service while the large in-transit reduces immediate additional ordering via the OR cap.

Period 7 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-04-08 (Period 7). Recent concluded arrivals show actual lead_time = 4 (Period1\u21925, Period2\u21926), so use calculated lead time consistent with observations. Demand has stepped up sharply in the last 5 periods (most recent demands: 152,129,213,268,376) \u2014 recent regime indicates a higher mean and higher volatility versus the original 5-sample history. On-hand = 0, in-transit = 775 (pipeline large but includes outstanding orders that will arrive with L\u22484). To balance service (high recent demand) vs holding cost, I use recent_N estimates over the last 5 demands so the OR engine raises the base-stock and reflects increased variance; keeping L set to observed average avoids underestimating pipeline timing and prevents over-ordering to cover phantom shorter lead times.

Period 8 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-15): on-hand=0, in-transit=930. Concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=4 for orders placed in Periods 1-3 (arrivals recorded in Periods 5-7), so use calculated average lead time. Recent demand shows an upward regime in the most recent 3 samples (152,129,213 \u2192 mean\u2248164.7); use recent_N=3 to capture this short-term increase for demand forecast and volatility. These choices increase mu_hat to cover (1+L) periods of elevated demand while sigma_hat recent_N captures current variability, balancing service level versus holding cost given modest profit/holding ratio.

Period 9 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/22 (Period 9). On-hand=0, in-transit=1078. All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 4 (orders from Periods 1\u20134 arrived in Periods 5\u20138 with W=4), so promised lead time is confirmed. Recent demand has shifted up sharply: last 3 concluded demands (Periods 6\u20138) = [376,295,367], mean \u2248 346; this is a clear changepoint above earlier recent3 mean\u2248165. To cover the review+lead demand while avoiding stockouts given confirmed L=4, I use L default (promised=4) and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent regime (recent_N, N=3) so the OR backend builds a base-stock reflecting the new higher mean and its volatility. This leverages confirmed lead time (no lost shipments) and prioritizes service level during the sustained higher-demand regime while limiting excess holding by using only the recent 3-period regime.

Carry-over insight: Sustained upward demand regime detected in most recent 3 periods (Periods 6\u20138): mean_recent3\u2248346 (samples 376,295,367); treat as sustained short-term increase until contradicted.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 10). On-hand=0, in-transit=1498. Concluded arrivals show observed lead_time=4 for multiple orders (orders from Periods 1\u20134), but a recent expected arrival (order from Period 5) did not arrive \u2192 evidence of occasional lost shipments; nevertheless observed lead times average to 4. Demand has a clear recent upward regime (Periods 6\u20138 demands = 376,295,367; mean\u2248346). To protect service while limiting holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1, set L to the calculated average observed lead time (captures proven 4-period lead), set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent short-term regime (recent_N with N=3) so the OR engine sizes base stock to cover the current higher demand and reflects recent volatility; this also mitigates risk from lost shipments by relying on recent realized demand rather than older low-demand samples.

Period 11 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/6 (Period 11). Recent demand has stepped up sharply: Periods 8\u201310 = [367,477,468], showing a new higher regime (recent3 mean\u2248404). Observed concluded lead times remain consistently 4 periods (multiple conclude messages show lead_time=4), so use calculated lead time. On-hand=0 with in-transit=1695 \u2014 pipeline is large but includes orders that may not all conclude (some recent orders delayed/lost). To prioritize service given profit/holding tradeoff, set demand forecast to emphasize the most recent 3-period regime (captures the jump) and estimate volatility from the same window so the OR engine raises base-stock appropriately while the cap limits excessive single-period orders.

Carry-over insight: New sustained upward demand regime detected in most recent 3 periods (Periods 8\u201310: 367,477,468), mean_recent3\u2248404; treat as sustained short-term increase until contradicted.

Historical concludes show consistent 4-period actual lead times for delivered orders (periods 5\u20138,10\u201311), but Period 9 shipment appears lost (ordered on P9, arrived=0). Recent demand has stepped up: Periods 9\u201311 demands = [477,468,332], indicating a recent higher-demand regime. I keep L as default (promised 4) because concluded lead times overwhelmingly equal 4; I use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to target the most recent elevated demand regime and recent_N (N=3) for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. This increases target base-stock to cover the current elevated demand while the large in-transit pipeline will constrain actual orders via the OR cap, limiting excess holding cost.

Period 13 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-20). Recent demands show a sustained elevated regime: last 3 observed demands (Periods 10\u201312) = [468, 332, 417], recent3 mean \u2248 406. On-hand is 37 with in-transit=1753; most historic concludes show actual lead_time=4 when arrivals occur, though Period 9 had a lost arrival. I therefore retain the promised lead time (default) for stability but update demand forecast to reflect the recent upward regime using the most recent 3 samples. Using recent_N=3 for mu_hat keeps the (1+L)-period forecast responsive; using recent_N=3 for sigma_hat captures current volatility. This balances service (higher mu_hat to avoid stockouts during the higher-demand regime) against holding cost given large in-transit inventory.

Period 14 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:

Actual lead times observed from concluded messages are consistently 4 periods (no lost shipments). To be responsive to the recent upward regime while using reliable lead-time info, set L to default (promised=4). Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets the (1+L)-period demand based on the most recent regime and captures recent volatility; this balances service (higher fill for elevated demand) against holding cost given large in-transit inventory.

Period 15 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-06-03). On-hand=51, in-transit=1331 (large pipeline). Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods \u2014 no evidence to change promised L. Recent demand regime remains elevated (carry-over notes: sustained upward in recent windows). To respect the detected short-term upward shift while avoiding overreacting given heavy pipeline, set L=default (use promised 4). Use mu_hat recent_N with N=3 to focus the OR forecast on the most recent elevated demand; use sigma_hat default to let backend scale volatility with full history. This balances service for higher recent demand while the large in-transit stock limits aggressive additional ordering.

Period 16 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10 (Period 16). Recent demand has shifted materially higher: last 3 concluded demands (Periods 13\u201315) = [370,525,330], mean\u2248408.3. On-hand=259, in-transit=1458 \u2014 ample pipeline but demands are elevated. All observed concluded lead_times = 4 periods (no evidence of longer/shorter regime). Choose L=default to trust promised lead time. Use mu_hat recent_N (N=3) to capture the sustained high short-term demand regime (focus on last 3 samples). Use sigma_hat recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent volatility around the new regime. These settings raise the backend base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of the current higher demand while sigma adapts service-level cap to recent variability, balancing service against holding cost given large pipeline.

Carry-over insight: New sustained high-demand regime in most recent 3 periods (Periods 13\u201315): mean_recent3\u2248408.3 (samples 370,525,330); treat as sustained short-term increase until contradicted.

Recent demand (Periods 14\u201316 = 525,330,302) shows a higher short-term mean; use recent_N with N=3 to capture the current regime for both forecast mean and volatility. This raises base-stock to cover the (1+L) review+lead window and balances service level vs holding cost given high pipeline.

Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current high-demand regime (captures last 3-sample mean/variance) so the OR engine sizes base-stock to cover (1+L) review+lead demand and keeps safety stock tuned to recent volatility.

Period 20 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=73 and large in-transit=2047 comfortably cover (1+L) periods at promised lead time, reducing urgency to increase safety stock beyond recent demand. Observed concluded arrivals show consistent 4-period actual lead time, so use promised/default L. To capture the sustained high-demand regime, set mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to center base-stock on the most recent high mean; set sigma_hat recent_N (N=3) to reflect current volatility and let OR backend compute service-level z given profit/holding costs. These choices balance service (avoid stockouts during the high-demand regime) while avoiding excessive extra holding since pipeline is already large.

Period 24 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 24). Recent demand regime is elevated vs early history (last 3 concluded demands: Periods 21\u201323 = 510, 710, 309 \u2192 mean\u2248510). Observed arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 in concluded history, so use promised/default lead time. On-hand=608 + in-transit=2124 => pipeline_inventory=2732, which comfortably covers (1+L) periods of higher demand but we still bias forecast to recent high-demand regime to avoid stockouts. I therefore set L=default, use a recent_N=3 demand forecast for mu_hat to capture the most recent high-demand regime, and use recent_N=3 for sigma_hat so safety stock reflects recent volatility (short N to react to regime).

Period 25 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-08-12). On-hand=1274, in-transit=1292. Concluded history shows consistent 4-period actual lead time (many arrives labeled lead_time=4). Recent demand shows a regime shift: last 3 concluded demands (Periods 22\u201324) = [710, 309, 176], mean_recent3 \u2248 398.3. To balance service vs holding cost I keep L=default (promised 4, confirmed by concludes), set mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to capture the current regime's short-term mean across review+lead, and use sigma_hat=default so variability is computed from full sample history scaled by sqrt(1+L). This keeps orders responsive to the recent elevated/volatile demand while leveraging historical variance for safety.

Period 26 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-19). On-hand=1968, in-transit=466. Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime (most recent 3-period mean \u2248 404 from periods 23\u201325 demand 309,176,132? \u2014 but longer recent windows in prior insights identified sustained upswing; use a short recent window to react to current elevated demand and avoid stockouts). Promised lead time is 4 periods and concluded messages consistently show lead_time=4 for arrived shipments, so keep L as default. To capture the recent elevated demand regime and increased variability, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 (reactive to the most recent regime). This biases the OR engine toward a higher base-stock to prioritize service (profit $2 vs holding $1) while leveraging current large on-hand + pipeline to avoid extreme overordering.

Period 27 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-26). Recent concludes show consistent lead_time=4 (no evidence of loss), and demand has been in a sustained high regime in recent periods (recent 3-period means ~400+ as tracked in prior insights). On-hand=1813, in-transit=466 => pipeline=2279, which already covers multiple periods of elevated demand, so avoid aggressive replenishment. Use promised lead time (default L=4) since concluded history consistently shows 4. For demand forecast use recent_N (N=3) to capture the sustained high-demand regime reflected in the last 3 demand samples; this prevents understocking if the regime persists. Use default sigma (backend's sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) since variance signal is mixed and pipeline is already large. These settings steer the OR engine to a base-stock aligned with the current high-demand regime while avoiding unnecessary additional arrivals given large on-hand+pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-1852.00

Period 28 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 28). On-hand=2130, in-transit=10 \u2014 inventory is very high vs recent demand (Periods 25\u201327 demands: 132,155,139). Historical concluded lead times are consistently 4 periods, so keep promised lead time. To avoid over-ordering given large on-hand, set mu_hat to recent_N using the last 3 demand samples to reflect the current lower-demand regime; keep sigma_hat as default to let backend use long-run volatility scaled by lead. This reduces replenishment while meeting a moderately high service target (profit $2, holding $1).

Carry-over insight: Excess inventory as of Period 28: on-hand 2130 + in-transit 10 >> recent 3-period demand mean (~142); reduce replenishment until concludes show sustained demand pickup.

Promised lead time is 4 and recent concludes show arrivals consistent with L=4 (no lost-shipment signal). To stop further inventory build-up, set lead time to promised (default) but base demand forecast on the most recent short-run regime (last 3 periods) which shows much lower demand; also tighten sigma to recent volatility to reduce safety stock.

Period 32 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019/9/30). Recent demand has fallen sharply since late Aug: last 3 concluded demands = [65, 30, 35] (Periods 29\u201331) => recent mean \u224843.3 units. On-hand is very high (1932) and in-transit 0; no overdue shipments visible. Given the clear recent low-demand regime, keep promised lead time (default L=4) but forecast using the most recent regime to avoid excess holding cost. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to anchor (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility to the latest low-demand observations, so the OR backend will cut replenishment quickly while preserving service for the smaller current demand.

Carry-over insight: New sustained low-demand regime detected in Periods 29\u201331 (demands 65,30,35), mean_recent3\u224843.3; high on-hand (1932) -> cut replenishment until concludes show demand pickup.

Period 33 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-07 (Period 33). On-hand=1870, in-transit=0; recent demand has fallen sharply (Periods 29\u201331: 65,30,35 -> mean\u224843.3) with Period 32 demand=62, confirming a sustained low-demand regime and large excess inventory. No recent arrivals (in-transit=0) and past concludes show promised lead time=4 was honored when shipments occurred. To avoid overstock holding cost, use promised lead time (L=default) and forecast demand using the most recent short-term regime: set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the last 3 periods (recent low-demand samples) so OR will cut replenishment until concludes indicate pickup. This balances service vs. holding cost given current large on-hand stock and no in-transit.

Carry-over insight: Sustained low-demand regime detected in Periods 29\u201331 (demands 65,30,35), mean_recent3\u224843.3; combined with very high on-hand (1870) -> reduce replenishment until concludes show sustained demand pickup.

Period 34 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019/10/14).

On-hand=1832, in-transit=0 \u2192 large excess inventory relative to (L+1)-period demand; avoid new receipts to reduce holding cost.

To avoid overstocking given very high on-hand vs. low recent demand, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 (capture the low-demand regime length of 6 periods). This reduces forecasted review+lead demand and estimated volatility so the OR backend will cut replenishment and lower orders until concludes indicate demand pickup or arrivals resume.

Period 36 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 36). Recent demand has dropped and stabilized: Periods 29\u201335 demands = [65,30,35,62,38,43,50], recent-7 mean \u224846.1 and low variance. On-hand=1739, in-transit=0 \u2014 large excess inventory relative to recent demand. Promised lead time is 4; no recent concludes indicate lost shipments. To avoid excess holding cost, keep lead time as promised (default) and set demand estimates using recent_N (N=7) to reflect the sustained low-demand regime so the OR backend will cut replenishment. Using recent_N for sigma captures reduced volatility and lowers safety stock accordingly.

Carry-over insight: New sustained low-demand regime detected Periods 29\u201335 (demands 65,30,35,62,38,43,50), recent7_mean\u224846.1; combined with very high on-hand (1739) -> cut replenishment until concludes show demand pickup.

Period 37 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-11-04). Recent concluded history (Periods 29\u201336) shows a sustained low-demand regime: recent 7 demands \u2248 [65,30,35,62,38,43,50], recent7_mean\u224846.1 and demand has remained low for 8 periods. On-hand is very high (1703) and in-transit=0, so replenish very conservatively to avoid holding cost. No recent concluded arrivals contradict promised lead time (past concluded arrivals showed lead_time=4), so keep L as promised. Use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to align the OR base-stock with the current low regime and reduce orders while the low-demand signal holds.

Recent concluded demands show a sustained low-demand regime (recent 3 demands \u224850,36,34 \u2192 mean\u224840) and inventory is very high vs. demand; no recent arrivals in-transit. To avoid further overstock while covering L+1 periods, set lead time to promised (default) and forecast demand using the most recent short-term regime (recent_N=3). Use recent_N for volatility as well to reflect reduced variability in the low-demand regime.

Period 39 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/18 (Period 39). Recent history (Periods 29\u201338) shows a sustained low-demand regime: demands = [65,30,35,62,38,43,50,36,34,42], recent10 mean\u224843.5 and low variance. On-hand = 1627, in-transit = 0 \u2192 large excess inventory vs. current demand. Observed concluded lead times have consistently been 4 periods. To avoid adding inventory while holding costs are high, use promised lead time (default=4) and base demand estimates on the most recent low-demand regime (recent_N with N=10) so the OR backend sizes replenishment to (1+L)\xd7recent mean; use recent_N for sigma to reflect current low volatility. This reduces orders while service level remains acceptable given large on-hand stock and prevents further holding-cost erosion.

Period 40 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/25 Period 40. Recent demand has been in a sustained low regime: last 3 demands (Periods 37\u201339) = [34,42,17], mean_recent3\u224831. On-hand is very high (1610) and in-transit=0, so we should substantially reduce replenishment and rely on on-hand to meet near-term demand. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 4 periods, so use promised lead time. Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current low-demand regime and reduce future orders accordingly; this biases the OR backend toward much lower base stock and smaller caps, minimizing holding cost while maintaining service for the short-term regime.

Recent demand has been in a sustained low regime (Periods 38-40: demands 42,17,113; recent3 mean\u224857.3) and inventory is very high vs. recent demand. Use promised lead time (no new evidence to change L). Set demand forecast to recent_N (N=3) to reflect the recent low-demand regime and avoid replenishing into excess stock. Use sigma recent_N (N=3) so safety stock reflects recent low volatility rather than earlier high-season variability.

Period 42 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019/12/9). Recent history (Periods 29\u201341) shows a sustained low-demand regime: recent 13-period mean \u224847.4 units/week while on-hand is high (1446) and in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 when shipments occurred, so use promised lead time. To avoid overstock, set demand forecast based on the recent low-demand regime (use recent_N with N=13) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine reduces replenishment; keep L as default (promised=4).

Carry-over insight: Sustained low-demand regime detected in Periods 29\u201341 (demands: 65,30,35,62,38,43,50,36,34,42,17,113,51), recent13_mean\u224847.4; high on-hand (1446) -> cut replenishment until concludes show sustained pickup.

Period 43 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16 (Period 43). On-hand=1389, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show a sustained low-demand regime since Periods 29\u201341 (recent13_mean\u224847.4 units/week) and no recent arrivals; prior lead times observed=4. Given very high on-hand relative to recent demand, reduce replenishment risk. Set L to promised default (4). Forecast mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=13 to reflect the sustained low-demand regime (keeps (1+L) scaling while capturing reduced mean and volatility), which will drive lower order quantities and limit holding cost exposure.

Carry-over insight: Sustained low-demand regime in Periods 29\u201341 (demands listed in history), recent13_mean\u224847.4; on-hand remains very high \u2192 cut replenishment until concludes show sustained pickup.

Period 44 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (Period 44). Recent history (Periods 29\u201343) shows a sustained low-demand regime (demands: 65,30,35,62,38,43,50,36,34,42,17,113,51,57,58) with recent mean ~47\u2013 fifty-range. All concluded arrivals that occurred show actual lead_time=4 periods (no evidence of lost shipments recently). On-hand=1331, in-transit=0 >> expected demand for multiple weeks at current low rate, so we should sharply reduce forecasted replenishment. Set L to default (use promised lead time=4). For demand forecast and volatility, use recent_N across the detected low-demand regime to reflect the new lower mean/variance and suppress orders until concludes indicate pickup. This reduces holding cost while keeping service for the current low demand.
