Period 1 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 1). SKU 599580017 has no on-hand or in-transit inventory and historical demands = [61,98,152,129,213] (mean trending ~130). Promised lead time is 4 periods and there are no concluded arrivals to infer a different lead time or lost shipments. To ensure the OR engine uses full historical signal across the (1+L) review+lead horizon while respecting the promised lead-time setting, I select default methods: L uses the promised lead time (conservative until we observe concluded lead times), mu_hat uses the default ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) to capture overall demand, and sigma_hat uses the default (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) for volatility. This balances service-level (capture demand spikes from recent high samples) vs. holding cost by not overreacting to short-term noise in the absence of arrival evidence.

Period 2 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/4 Period 2. On-hand=0, in-transit=225; Period 1 conclude shows ordered=225 arrived=0 so no concluded arrivals yet\u2014cannot infer actual lead time. Use promised lead time (default) to ensure pipeline covers (L+1) periods. Demand history average ~130.6 with samples [61,98,152,129,213]; no clear recent changepoint. Choose default methods so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample set, balancing service level against holding cost given limited evidence of lead-time or demand shift.

Period 3 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/11 (Period 3). On-hand=0, In-transit=453 (orders from Periods 1\u20132). No concluded arrivals yet; no evidence actual lead time differs from promised. Historical demands = [61,98,152,129,213] (mean=130.6). Use promised lead time and default demand estimates so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std consistently; this keeps policy aligned with backend assumptions while covering the (L+1) periods of demand given current pipeline.

Period 4 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/18 (Period 4). Recent demand history shows high variability with samples [61,98,152,129,213]; last three conclude messages show orders placed but arrived=0 -> possible lost/ delayed shipments. On-hand=0, in-transit=681 (pipeline present but unconfirmed by any 'arrived' conclude). Promised lead time=4 and no concluded arrivals observed, so do not override L from scant evidence. Use default methods so OR backend uses full-sample mean/variance across (1+L) review+lead window; this keeps policy conservative given high recent demand and pipeline uncertainty while avoiding overfitting to unconfirmed arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Three consecutive periods (Periods 1-3) show ordered >0 but arrived=0, signaling likely delayed or lost shipments; treat pipeline as unreliable until arrivals are concluded.

Period 5 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-25). History shows three consecutive concludes (Periods 1-3) plus Period 4 with ordered>0 but arrived=0 \u2192 pipeline appears unreliable / shipments delayed or lost. Demand history: [61,98,152,129,213] shows an uptick recently (last 3: 152,129,213). To protect service while some in-transit may never arrive, I extend assumed lead time modestly and size safety stock using the recent higher-demand regime. Chosen: L explicit=5 to reflect likely longer effective lead time than promised; mu_hat recent_N N=3 to base forecast on the newest higher-demand regime (covers review+lead period = 1+L); sigma_hat recent_N N=3 to capture recent volatility. These settings increase target inventory to preserve fill rate despite missing arrivals while acknowledging higher holding cost via recent-based estimates rather than full-sample smoothing.

Period 6 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 6). Recent observed demands have trended up (Periods 1-5 demands: 175,173,181,200,268) with a clear uptick in the last 3 periods (181,200,268 \u2192 mean ~216). One concluded arrival shows lead_time=4 (Period1\u2192Period5), so promised lead time remains supported; however multiple earlier ordered-but-not-yet-concluded shipments indicate some pipeline unreliability. To balance service vs holding cost: keep L as default (use promised 4), base mu_hat on the most recent regime (recent_N N=3) to capture the upward demand shift, and estimate volatility over the same recent window (sigma_hat recent_N N=3). This raises the backend\u2019s target stock to cover the higher recent demand while limiting exposure to outdated in-transit quantities that may be unreliable.

Period 7 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08 (Period 7). Recent concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 4 (orders from Periods 1-2 arrived in Periods 5-6), matching the promised lead time. Pipeline is large (in-transit=834) but historically unreliable: Periods 1-3 had ordered>0 with arrived=0, so treat outstanding pipeline cautiously. Demand has accelerated in recent periods (demands in concluded periods: 175,173,181,200,268,376); to bias forecast toward recent demand while keeping L=4, use an EWMA for mu_hat (gamma=0.6) to emphasize recent spikes. Use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture elevated recent volatility. These settings raise target base-stock to improve service during the spike while sigma_hat reflects higher variability; keeping L=default (promised 4) keeps timing consistent with observed arrivals but remain cautious about potential lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline unreliability: Periods 1-3 had orders >0 but arrived=0 (then later arrivals from Periods 1-2 only), treat in-transit as unreliable until future concludes confirm arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $456.00

Period 8 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15 (Period 8). Recent concluded history shows arrivals from orders placed in Periods 1-3 with lead_time=4, and three earlier >0 orders had arrived late or been delayed \u2014 pipeline is unreliable but recent concludes consistently show 4-period transit. Demand has jumped sharply in recent periods (demands in Periods 4-7 = 200,268,376,295) vs earlier lower values, indicating a sustained higher-demand regime. I set L using calculated historical lead times (average=4). For demand, I use recent_N=4 to capture the new high-demand regime (use last 4 periods: 200,268,376,295) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7recent mean. For sigma_hat I use recent_N=4 to capture recent volatility. These settings raise the base-stock to cover the longer, confirmed lead time and higher recent demand while using recent volatility to avoid overstock from older low-demand data.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time confirmed = 4 periods based on concluded arrivals: Period 5 (ordered P1 -> lead_time 4), Period 6 (ordered P2 -> 4), Period 7 (ordered P3 -> 4). Pipeline previously unreliable but recent concludes consistently show 4-period lead time.

Period 9 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-22). Recent concluded periods show strong, sustained demand spikes (Periods 4-8: 200,268,376,295,367) and recent concludes consistently confirm actual lead time = 4. On-hand=0, in-transit=1327 (pipeline now appears reliable for arrivals since Periods 5-8). To capture the elevated recent demand while reflecting confirmed L=4, I use recent demand window of the last 5 concluded periods so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect current mean and volatility; L uses default (promised=4) because concluded arrivals show 4-period lead time. These choices increase target base-stock to avoid stockouts during the high-demand regime while sigma_hat recent_N captures higher variability so the OR engine raises safety stock accordingly.

Period 11 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 11). Recent concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 (Period5: P1->4, P6: P2->4, P7: P3->4, P8: P4->4, P9: P5->4, P10: P6->4). Pipeline earlier appeared unreliable but recent concludes confirm stable 4-period lead time. Demand has shifted upward since Period 6 (recent demands [376,295,367,477,468] vs earlier ~175-268), so I use recent data to size the review+lead demand. Choices: L by "calculate" to lock to observed average lead time (4); mu_hat by "recent_N" with N=5 to capture the new high-demand regime across the (1+L) review+lead window; sigma_hat by "recent_N" with N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters prioritize service (capture elevated demand) while sigma_hat and backend cap limit over-ordering to control holding cost given holding/profit tradeoff.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time confirmed = 4 periods based on concluded arrivals P5-P10 (ordered P1-P6 -> lead_time 4); Recent demand regime increase: mean demand in Periods 6-10 = 396.6 units vs Periods 1-5 \u2248199.4 units, adopt recent window for forecasting.

On-hand = 90, in-transit = 1177 (pipeline previously unreliable early but recent concludes consistently confirm 4-period lead time). Choices: set L by "calculate" so backend uses observed lead-times (matches confirmed 4). Use mu_hat recent_N with N=5 to base forecast on the higher-demand regime (1+L multiplied by mean of last 5 demands). Use sigma_hat recent_N with N=5 to reflect volatility in the recent high-demand window. This increases target base_stock to meet service in the elevated-demand regime while keeping variance estimate focused on recent variability; using recent windows mitigates the earlier lost-shipment noise from Periods 1-4.

Period 13 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-20). On-hand=78, in-transit=1294. Historical concludes confirm a stable 4-period actual lead time (multiple concluded arrivals show lead_time=4) and a demand regime shift: Periods 6-10 mean demand \u2248396.6 vs Periods 1-5 \u2248199.4. Pipeline has recovered (consistent 4-period arrivals recently). I therefore use the promised/default lead time (4) and forecast using the most recent regime (last 5 periods) to capture the higher demand level; volatility is estimated from the same recent window. This balances service (higher base stock to meet elevated demand) against holding cost by limiting the horizon to the recent high-demand regime (N=5).

Period 14 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-27). Recent concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (consistent arrivals for orders placed in P1-P9 with W=4). On-hand=0, in-transit=1560 but pipeline was previously unreliable; recent consistent concludes restore confidence in L=4. Demand regime has shifted up: Periods 6-10 mean \u2248396.6 vs Periods 1-5 \u2248199.4, so forecast should use the recent high-demand window. I set L=default to use the promised/confirmed 4-period lead time; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=5 (the recent regime length) so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std, which raises order targets to cover the higher demand while keeping volatility estimated from the same recent window.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods based on multiple concluded arrivals (orders P1-P9); Recent demand regime increase: mean demand for Periods 6-10 \u2248396.6 vs Periods 1-5 \u2248199.4 \u2014 use recent window for forecasting.

Period 15 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/3 (Period 15). Concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods and recent demand has shifted higher starting Period 6. Pipeline currently shows 2076 in-transit but earlier lost/late shipments were resolved and recent concludes confirm reliable 4-period arrivals. Demand regime: Periods 6-14 show substantially higher demand than Periods 1-5; use a recent-window forecast to capture the new mean/volatility. Therefore use default lead time (promised 4), and recent_N (N=9) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor forecasts to the post-changepoint regime (regime length \u22489 periods: Periods 6\u201314). This balances higher target base-stock to meet elevated demand while using recent volatility to limit excess holding given $1 holding cost and $2 profit.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (evidence: multiple concluded arrivals P5-P14 showing ordered on P1-P10 with lead_time=4); Demand regime increased starting Period 6 (mean Periods 6\u201314 materially > Periods 1\u20135) \u2014 use recent-window forecasts.

Period 16 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-06-10). Recent concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods and pipeline now reliable. Demand regime increased starting Period 6 (Periods 6\u201314 mean >> Periods 1\u20135); therefore use a recent-window forecast to capture the higher mean and volatility. Set L to promised (default=4). Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=9 (covering Periods 6\u201314) so the OR backend targets the higher demand regime and balances higher service level vs holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time confirmed = 4 periods (multiple concluded arrivals P5\u2013P14); Demand regime increase starting Period 6 (Periods 6\u201314 mean demand materially > Periods 1\u20135) \u2014 use recent-window forecasting.

Period 17 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:

Demand regime shifted up starting Period 6 (Periods 6\u201316 average materially > Periods 1\u20135). On-hand=412 + in-transit=1351 gives large pipeline but past early-period missing arrivals flagged unreliability; however multiple recent concludes validate L=4. I set L via calculate to reflect observed lead times; for forecasting I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat using the recent high-demand regime (N=11 covering Periods 6\u201316) so the backend targets (1+L)-period demand under the new mean/variance dynamics, balancing service (higher base-stock) vs holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Demand regime shift detected starting Period 6: recent periods show materially higher demand vs Periods 1-5. To reflect reliable 4-period lead time I set L by calculating observed lead times. To capture the new higher-demand regime I use a recent-window forecast covering the most recent regime (Periods 6\u201317, regime length \u224812) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect current elevated mean and volatility; this increases the base-stock to improve service during high demand while sigma_hat recent_N raises safety stock to mitigate stockouts given observed variability.

Period 19 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/1 (Period 19). Concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 (many concluded arrivals from orders P1\u2013P14 with lead_time=4). Demand regime shifted up starting Period 6: mean demand Periods 6\u201318 materially higher than Periods 1\u20135. Pipeline previously unreliable early but recent concludes are consistent with L=4. I therefore use the promised/default lead time (4) and base demand forecasts on the recent high-demand regime (most recent 13 periods, Periods 6\u201318) to capture the new mean and volatility while keeping sigma aligned to recent variability. This balances service (avoid stockouts under higher demand) against holding cost by sizing base stock to the elevated recent mean and measured recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (evidence: multiple concluded arrivals showing ordered on P1\u2013P14 arriving with lead_time=4); Demand regime increase beginning Period 6 (Periods 6\u201318 mean demand materially > Periods 1\u20135) \u2014 use recent-window forecasting.

Period 20 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/8 (Period 20). On-hand=0, in-transit=1726. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods; pipeline previously unreliable but recent concludes stable. Demand regime increased starting Period 6 (substantially higher mean since P6). To capture the new regime, use a recent-window for demand (Periods 6\u201319 => 14 samples) so mu/sigma reflect elevated demand and reduce stockouts given L=4. Use promised/default lead time to align with confirmed actual lead time and OR backend expectations.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time = 4 periods confirmed by multiple concluded arrivals; demand regime increased starting Period 6 (use recent-window forecasting).

Period 21 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-15 (Period 21). On-hand=0, in-transit=2012. Concluded history shows consistent arrived shipments with lead_time=4 (many orders ordered on P1\u2013P16 arrived with W=4), and demand has a sustained upward regime starting Period 6 (periods 6\u201320 show materially higher demand than periods 1\u20135). Pipeline was unreliable early but recent concludes confirm stable 4-period lead time. Therefore keep L at the promised lead time, and use a recent-window forecast to capture the higher demand regime. Choose N=15 (regime length Periods 6\u201320 = 15) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes demand across review+lead using the recent elevated-demand samples, which increases base_stock to meet higher demand while sigma_hat recent_N captures current volatility. This addresses prior missing shipments by relying on confirmed lead_time=4 and using recent demand evidence to avoid underordering.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time confirmed = 4 periods by concluded arrivals (evidence: multiple concluded arrivals for orders placed P1\u2013P16 arriving with lead_time=4); Demand regime increased starting Period 6 (Periods 6\u201320 mean demand materially > Periods 1\u20135) \u2014 use recent-window forecasting (N=15).

Period 23 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29 (Period 23). Recent concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods and a sustained demand regime shift beginning at Period 6 (recent periods materially higher demand). On-hand=0, in-transit=1865 (pipeline now reliable per multiple concludes). I set L to default (promised 4) since concludes confirm LT=4. For forecasting I use a recent-window to capture the post-change higher demand: mu_hat -> recent_N N=15 to reflect demand from the recent high regime; sigma_hat -> recent_N N=15 to capture recent volatility. These choices bias the OR base-stock toward the higher recent mean to avoid stockouts given long lead time while using recent volatility for appropriate safety stock.

Period 24 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-08-05). Recent concluded history consistently shows actual lead time = 4 periods and a sustained higher-demand regime beginning at Period 6. On-hand=331, in-transit=1903 => pipeline_total=2234, which covers multiple (L+1) periods at elevated demand but note some earlier shipments were delayed; recent concludes show reliable 4-period arrivals. I set L to default (promised lead time=4) because concluded arrivals repeatedly confirm 4. For demand I use a recent-window estimate to capture the higher post-Period-6 regime: mu_hat recent_N N=15 (captures Periods 9\u201323 roughly, aligned with recommended recent-window N=15). For volatility I use sigma_hat recent_N N=15 to reflect recent demand variance. These choices let the OR backend compute a base-stock tuned to current high-demand regime while relying on confirmed 4-period lead time and observed pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time confirmed = 4 periods (multiple concluded arrivals ordered on P1\u2013P19 arriving with lead_time=4); Demand regime increased starting Period 6 (Periods 6\u201323 mean materially > Periods 1\u20135) \u2014 use recent-window forecasting (N=15).

Period 25 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-08-12). Recent concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods; demand has been in a higher regime since Period 6. On-hand=749, in-transit=1602 \u2014 pipeline has been reliable recently (many concluded arrivals with lead_time=4). I therefore use the promised/confirmed lead time and a recent-window forecast to capture the higher post-changepoint demand (use N=15 to cover Periods 11\u201325-ish where elevated demand is observed). Sigma uses the same recent window to reflect current volatility. These settings prioritize service (meet high demand) while the OR engine will cap orders using its cap formula to limit over-ordering.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time confirmed = 4 periods based on multiple concluded arrivals (orders P1\u2013P20 arriving with lead_time=4); Demand regime increased starting Period 6 \u2014 use recent-window forecasting (N=15).

Period 26 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:

Recent concluded history consistently shows actual lead time = 4 periods and a sustained demand regime increase starting Period 6; current on-hand=958 and in-transit=1356 (pipeline has been reliable in recent concludes). To prioritize service while controlling holding cost (profit=$2, holding=$1 \u2192 q=2/(2+1)=0.666..), use promised/default lead time (matches observed 4) and base forecasts from the recent high-demand regime. I choose recent_N (N=15) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the elevated demand mean/variance from the recent regime (stabilized over many concludes) so the OR engine raises base-stock appropriately while the cap limits extreme orders.

Period 27 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-26). On-hand=1093, in-transit=1106. Concluded arrivals across many periods consistently show actual lead time = 4. Demand regime shifted up starting Period 6 (recent periods materially higher demand). Pipeline had earlier unreliability but recent concludes show consistent 4-period lead time. Set L to default (promised 4) to match confirmed actual lead time. Use recent_N (N=15) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the (1+L)-period forecast and volatility reflect the sustained higher-demand regime and provide appropriate safety stock; this balances higher service (avoid stockouts under elevated demand) vs holding cost given current high on-hand inventory.

Period 28 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-09-02). Historical concludes consistently confirm actual lead time = 4 periods and a sustained demand regime increase beginning Period 6. On-hand=1632, in-transit=536 \u2014 pipeline has recently behaved reliably (multiple concluded arrivals with LT=4). I set L to "calculate" so backend uses observed lead times (confirmed =4). For forecasting I use recent_N (N=15) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the higher demand regime (Periods 14\u201328 include the elevated demand pattern); this focuses the forecast on the recent high-demand regime and keeps safety stock responsive to recent volatility. These choices prioritize service (profit per unit $2 vs holding $1) while limiting excess stock by using recent data rather than overall historical averages.

Period 35 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-21). On-hand=1876, in-transit=0. Historical concludes consistently confirm actual lead time = 4 periods; earlier pipeline unreliability has been resolved by repeated concluded arrivals. Demand regime increased starting Period 6 (recent periods materially higher than Periods 1-5); to capture the elevated demand level I use a recent-window forecast. Therefore: use promised/default lead time, and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=15 to reflect the sustained higher-demand regime and recent variance.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-28). On-hand=1826, in-transit=0. Historical concludes consistently confirm actual lead time = 4 periods; pipeline now showing no in-transit units. Demand regime increased earlier (starting ~Period 6) \u2014 recent-window forecasting better captures higher demand patterns. Use promised lead time (default) = 4, and recent_N N=15 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to align (1+L)-period forecast/volatility to the recent elevated demand while avoiding unnecessary new receipts given large on-hand. This balances service (capture higher demand) vs holding cost by forecasting from recent demand but relying on current large on-hand to defer fresh orders.

Period 37 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-11-04). Current on-hand 1790, in-transit 0. Historical concludes confirm stable actual lead time = 4 periods and a sustained demand regime shift upward beginning Period 6; recent periods show much lower weekly demand (Oct) but regime mean remains higher earlier. Pipeline has no outstanding arrivals visible, so rely on confirmed L=4 and recent-demand calibration. I set L to promised (default=4) and use a recent_N=15 window for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-changepoint higher-demand regime (as documented in carry-over insights). This balances service level (capture higher-average demand) while letting the OR cap limit order size to control holding cost given large current on-hand.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time confirmed = 4 periods (multiple concluded arrivals show lead_time=4); Demand regime increased starting Period 6 \u2014 use recent-window forecasting with N=15.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-1688.00

Period 38 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 38). On-hand=1756, in-transit=0. Historical concludes consistently confirm actual lead time = 4 periods and demand shifted upward starting around Period 6; recent low weekly demand since Periods 29\u201337 reflects seasonality but the elevated regime (Periods 6\u201328) is the dominant signal for planning. With high on-hand and no reliable pipeline, use the promised/default L to match confirmed lead time, and base demand forecast on a recent-window (N=15) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime while allowing the backend to compute base_stock and cap. Use recent_N for sigma to let variability reflect the same recent window. This balances service (avoid stockouts when lead time=4) against holding cost given large on-hand stock.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time confirmed = 4 periods (multiple concluded arrivals); demand regime increased starting Period 6 \u2014 use recent-window forecasting (N=15).

Period 39 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 39). On-hand=1714, in-transit=0. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple orders concluded with lead_time=4); earlier pipeline losses occurred but recent concludes confirm reliability at L=4. Demand regime shifted up beginning Period 6 \u2014 recent periods show materially higher demand. I set L using observed lead times (calculate) to lock in confirmed 4-period actual lead time. For forecasting I use a recent-window (N=15) to capture the higher-demand regime when computing mu_hat and sigma_hat so base-stock reflects the new mean/volatility. This keeps service high while avoiding excessive future holding by grounding forecasts in the recent elevated demand samples and acknowledging current zero in-transit.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time confirmed = 4 periods (multiple concluded arrivals through Period 38); demand regime increased starting Period 6 \u2014 use recent-window forecasting N=15.

Period 40 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 40). On-hand=1697, in-transit=0. Historical concludes repeatedly confirm actual lead time = 4 periods and a sustained demand regime increase beginning Period 6; recent periods show much lower week-on-week demand but regime higher than early periods. Pipeline previously unreliable but recent concluded arrivals confirm stable L=4. To capture the post-changepoint demand level I use a recent-window forecast (N=15) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets stock for the higher-demand regime while L remains the promised/default value. This balances higher service (profit>holding) against holding cost given large on-hand inventory and zero in-transit.

Period 41 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-12-02). On-hand=1584, in-transit=0. Historical concludes consistently confirm actual lead time = 4 periods and earlier pipeline unreliability has been resolved by repeated concludes. Current on-hand is ample vs recent demand; profit= $2, holding=$1 implies moderate service emphasis (q\u22480.667). I set L to default (promised lead time = 4) consistent with concluded evidence. Demand exhibits a sustained higher regime since Period 6; to capture the recent regime while limiting noise I use recent_N (N=15) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7recent mean and scales volatility by sqrt(1+L). This balances service (avoid stockouts given confirmed L=4) against holding cost given large current on-hand and moderate safety factor.

To capture the higher recent mean/volatility while using confirmed L=4, set lead time method to default (promised 4) and use recent_N (N=15) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor forecasts to the most recent regime (balances service level given profit/holding tradeoff).
