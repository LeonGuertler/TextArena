Period 1 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. SKU 599580017 swimwear; historical demands = [61,98,152,129,213] (mean ~130). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 and no concluded arrivals yet, so no evidence of lead-time deviation or lost shipments. Use promised lead time and default demand aggregation to let OR backend compute (1+L)*mean and scaled std; this balances service vs holding given profit=2 and holding=1 without overfitting to limited recent noise.

Period 2 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 (2019-03-04). SKU 599580017 swim bottom: on-hand=0, in-transit=225 (ordered in Period 1). Promised lead time=2; no concluded arrivals yet so actual lead time cannot be inferred. Historical demands [61,98,152,129,213], mean \u2248130.6. Pipeline covers upcoming lead+review periods under promised LT. Use default L and default demand estimates so OR backend uses full-sample mean/variance ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This avoids premature adjustments given no concluded late/ lost shipments evidence.

Period 3 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/11. Recent arrival shows an actual lead time of 1 period (Period 2 conclude: arrived=225 ordered on Period 1, lead_time was 1). On-hand 52 + in-transit 228 = 280 units in pipeline; expected demand per period ~130.6 (history mean). Given observed shorter lead time and available pipeline, use inferred lead time=calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Use default demand/volatility scaling ((1+L)\xd7mean, sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so OR backend computes base stock and cap with consistent statistics. This balances service (keep coverage for current+next period) while avoiding excess holding given holding cost=$1 vs profit=$2.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time observed = 1 period (evidence: Period 2 conclude: ordered on Period 1 arrived in Period 2, lead_time was 1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $104.00

Period 4 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/18. Recent concluded history shows actual lead time = 1 period (Period 2 conclude: ordered on P1 arrived in P2). On-hand=0, in-transit=266 which approximately equals (1+L)\xd7mean historical demand (~261) so pipeline is adequate. Choose L by averaging observed lead times to reflect actual faster arrivals. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, keeping safety buffer aligned with historical variability and the OR engine's cap.

Period 5 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 5). Historical demands: [61,98,152,129,213] (mean=130.6). Recent concluded evidence shows an observed lead time = 1 period (Period 2 conclude: order on P1 arrived in P2). On-hand=0, in-transit=326 (pipeline large vs recent demand). Given the concluded lead-time evidence, set L by averaging observed lead times to reflect actual faster arrivals. Use default demand aggregation for mu_hat and sigma_hat to let backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample; this balances smoothing across limited samples while the large in-transit pipeline already provides coverage for upcoming periods.

Period 6 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period=6 (2019-04-01). Recent demand sequence shows elevated and volatile weekly demand (samples: [61,98,152,129,213], mean\u2248130.6) with large spikes (213, 152). Lead-time observations from concluded messages: Period2 conclude => order from P1 arrived in P2 (LT=1); Period5 conclude => order from P2 arrived in P5 (LT=3). This indicates unstable actual lead time (1 and 3). To balance service vs holding cost (profit $2, holding $1 \u2192 service quantile q=2/(2+1)=0.6667), use an inferred average lead time (calculate) so the OR backend uses L=2 for pipeline coverage while still letting backend compute base_stock from full-sample demand stats. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend applies (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std of all samples, preserving responsiveness to high recent demand spikes. This setup hedges against observed LT variability and ensures (1+L) periods of demand are covered without overcommitting inventory given holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Observed lead time variability: confirmed arrivals show LT=1 (P2 conclude for order placed P1) and LT=3 (P5 conclude for order placed P2); average observed LT\u22482. Treat LT as unstable\u2014monitor for lost shipments if further non-arrivals occur.

Daily Reward (R_t): $196.00

Period 7 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019/4/8): recent concluded arrivals show inconsistent lead times (observed LT values = 1,3,3,2 \u2192 mean \u22482.25) and on-hand=0 with in-transit=268. Demand history samples [61,98,152,129,213] indicate rising variability; pipeline is large but past shipments experienced delays/loss risk. I choose L=calculate to let backend use the empirical average observed LT (captures instability without overfitting one recent value). For demand and volatility I select default methods so backend computes mu_hat=(1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples), leveraging full-sample estimates while the adaptive L captures lead-time irregularity. This balances service (higher base stock from larger L) against holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Period 8 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/15 (Period 8). Recent demand has risen sharply (Period5-7 demands = 268, 376, 295) and on-hand is 0 with 420 units in-transit; observed lead times have been unstable (1,3,3,2). Set L to calculate so backend uses average of observed lead times (captures instability). For demand I use recent_N (N=3) to reflect the new higher-demand regime (focus on Period5-7). Sigma also uses recent_N (N=3) to capture recent volatility. These choices bias orders upward to cover the elevated recent demand while letting the OR engine compute safety stock given the inferred lead-time and recent variability, helping balance service level vs holding cost given current zero on-hand and large in-transit but unstable arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Recent sustained demand increase starting Period 5: mean of Period5-7 demands = 313 units (268, 376, 295); treat demand as higher-regime until contradicted.

Period 9 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/22 (Period 9). Demand regime shifted up starting Period 5 (Period5-8 demands = 268,376,295,367). Observed concluded lead times are variable (1,3,3,2 \u2192 avg\u22482.25) and shipments have been delayed/irregular; in-transit = 661 and on-hand = 0. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses observed lead times (captures instability). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=4 to reflect the higher-demand regime (Periods 5\u20138) so the base-stock and caps are sized to meet elevated demand while recognizing current pipeline. This balances higher service needs vs holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

Period 10 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-29). On-hand=20, in-transit=189. Historical concluded lead-times show high variability (observed Ls = 1,3,3,2,3,1; avg\u22482.17) and a sustained demand uplift starting Period 5 (recent demands: 268,376,295,367,477). To capture unstable LT use the empirical average of observed lead-times (calculate). For demand, use a recent-regime estimate over the last 5 periods (Period5-9) to reflect the higher mean; likewise use recent-N volatility (N=5) to capture elevated variance. These choices increase target base-stock to meet elevated demand while accounting for observed LT instability and avoid under-ordering given overdue/late arrivals in history.

Period 11 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/6 (Period 11). Recent demand has been in a higher regime since Period 5 (periods 5-10 show elevated demand: 268,376,295,367,477,468). On-hand=0, in-transit=528 (some earlier orders arrive variably; observed lead times have been inconsistent with promised 2). For L use 'calculate' to let backend average observed lead times (captures instability between 1\u20133 periods). For mu_hat use recent_N with N=6 (regime from Period5\u201310 length=6) so (1+L)\xd7mean of last 6 demand samples captures the sustained higher demand. For sigma_hat use recent_N with N=6 to reflect elevated volatility in the new regime. This balances higher service target against holding cost while allowing the OR engine to account for observed LT variability and recent demand spike.

Period 12 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-05-13). Recent demand regime elevated since Period 5 (periods 5-11 avg demand \u2248 362) and on-hand=0 with in-transit=778. Observed concluded lead times are variable (sequence: 1,3,3,2,3,1,3,2) \u2192 recent average \u22482.2. To reflect unstable but trending ~2 periods, set L using recent_N to weight recent observations. For demand, use recent_N over the higher-demand regime (Periods 5-11, length=7) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7recent mean of elevated demand. Use recent_N for sigma_hat with same N to capture current volatility. These choices increase target base-stock to meet higher demand while using recent lead-time evidence to avoid under-ordering given late arrivals; they also let the OR backend apply its cap to limit over-ordering against lost shipments.

Period 13 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-20). On-hand=0, in-transit=787. Historical concluded lead times show high variability (observed W = 1,3,3,2,3,1,3,2; avg\u22482.25) and several late arrivals/lost-shipment signals; demand increased starting Period 5 and has remained elevated (periods 5-12 demands = 268,376,295,367,477,468,332,417). I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures instability). For demand I use recent_N with N=8 to capture the new higher-demand regime since Period 5; same N=8 for sigma_hat to reflect volatility in that regime. These choices bias base_stock upward to cover the sustained higher demand while letting the OR engine compute safety stock using the inferred lead-time behavior; using recent samples helps cover overdue/in-transit exposures and reduces stockouts given observed late arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Sustained higher demand regime starting Period 5 (evidence: Period5-12 demands mean \u2248 383; sample = 268,376,295,367,477,468,332,417). Lead time unstable: observed L samples = [1,3,3,2,3,1,3,2], average \u22482.25; monitor for lost shipments if further non-arrivals occur.

Period 14 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-27). Demand has been in a sustained higher regime since Period 5 (recent mean \u2248374.4 over Periods 5\u201313). Lead time is unstable (observed LT samples = [1,3,3,2,3,1,3,2]); use a recent average to capture current instability. Set L using recent_N to smooth short-term LT variability (N=5 -> recent average \u22482.2). For demand, use an explicit mu_hat that reflects the higher demand regime across the review+lead period: (1+L)\xd7mean \u22483.2\xd7374.44 \u22481198.22 to ensure sufficient coverage while OR backend applies its service-level cap. Keep sigma_hat as default so backend computes volatility using all samples scaled by sqrt(1+L). This setup balances higher service level (avoiding stockouts during the elevated-demand regime) against holding cost while acknowledging lead-time instability and possible lost shipments.

Period 16 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-06-10). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime starting Period 5 (periods 5-12 mean \u2248383 units/period) and unstable lead times (observed samples average \u22482.25). Current inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=992 units \u2192 pipeline covers ~2.6 periods at the higher-demand rate (992/383\u22482.6) so risk of stockout remains. Choose L="calculate" to let backend use the average of observed lead times (captures instability without hard-committing to a single explicit LT). For demand, use recent_N with N=8 (Periods 5-12 form the higher-demand regime) so mu_hat reflects the (1+L)-scaled mean of the higher regime. For sigma_hat use recent_N N=8 to capture the elevated variability in the same recent regime. These settings prioritize service during the confirmed higher-demand regime while letting the backend account for observed lead-time behaviour; they also avoid over-committing inventory if some in-transit shipments are lost because L is inferred from observed concludes rather than forced explicit short LT.

Period 17 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-17). Recent demand has been in a higher regime since Period 5 (periods 5-12 mean \u2248383); last observed demands remain elevated. On-hand=0, in-transit=992 \u2014 pipeline large but arrivals have been irregular (historical observed LT samples show variability, average \u22482.25). To capture the higher-demand regime while letting the OR engine infer LT from observations, set L to be calculated from observed lead times, and set demand estimates using the recent higher-demand window (Periods 5-12) to reflect the regime shift. Using recent_N for sigma aligns volatility estimate with the same window. This balances service (meet elevated demand) versus holding cost given large in-transit volume and unstable arrivals.

Period 18 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24 (Period 18). Demand has been in a sustained higher regime since Period 5 (recent demands high, frequent stockouts). Observed lead times are unstable (samples avg \u22482.25, values include 1,2,3) and several late arrivals indicate variability but no definitive single LT; use observed-average to let backend adapt. Set L by calculating average observed lead times to reflect variability. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the recent higher-demand regime (Periods 5\u201312, 8 samples) so the base-stock covers the elevated demand across review+lead periods. On-hand=0, in-transit=512 \u2014 pipeline is substantial but variable; these parameters raise target inventory to reduce imminent stockouts while relying on backend cap to limit oversized orders.

To capture recent lead-time variability and the sustained higher demand regime, I use recent-N estimates (N=8) for lead time, demand forecast across review+lead, and volatility. This biases orders toward the elevated demand while reflecting current LT variability so the OR backend raises base-stock and cap to avoid stockouts given many overdue/nonconcluding shipments.

Period 21 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime starting Period 5 (elevated demands through Periods 5-20) and highly variable actual lead times (arrivals show 1\u20133 periods, average \u22482.25). On-hand=0, in-transit=1052 units (large pipeline). I choose to let the backend infer average observed lead time from concluded arrivals (method=calculate) to capture the unstable LT regime. For demand I use a recent_N estimate over the entire higher-demand regime (Periods 5\u201320, N=16) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the sustained uplift and recent volatility; this keeps base stock responsive to elevated demand while the OR engine caps orders to avoid over-ordering into the large in-transit.

Period 22 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-22). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime beginning Period 5 (recent demands large: e.g. Period5-21 many samples >260, recent means \u2248350\u2013500). On-hand=0, in-transit=1010 (large pipeline but arrivals are noisy historically). Observed lead times are unstable (samples average \u22482.25); to let backend estimate LT from observations use 'calculate'. For demand I treat the higher regime as persistent and use a recent-window estimator to capture the elevated mean and volatility: set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=8 (captures recent high-demand periods while respecting changepoint at Period 5). This balances service (higher base stock to avoid lost sales in high demand) vs holdings (pipeline already large), letting OR compute exact base stock and cap.

Period 23 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019-07-29). On-hand=0, in-transit=971. Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime since Period 5 (large, consistent sales) and variable actual lead times with many arrivals > promised 2. I set L to 'calculate' to use the average of observed lead times (captures instability and multi-modal L samples). For demand I use recent_N with N=18 (Periods 5\u201322) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (avoids dilution by low early samples). Sigma uses recent_N N=18 to reflect recent volatility. These choices push the OR base-stock toward the higher recent demand while letting the backend compute safety stock from the empirically estimated lead time and recent variability, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=2 and holding=1.

Carry-over insight: New: Demand has remained in a higher regime from Period 5\u201322 (mean demand \u2248455 units over Periods 5\u201322, sum=8169, n=18). Observed lead times remain unstable but average \u22482.33 periods (many samples with LT=1,2,3); monitor for lost shipments if non-arrivals continue.

Period 24 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 24). Demand has been in a sustained higher regime since Period 5 (see history Periods 5\u201322). Observed lead times are unstable (mix of 1\u20133 periods, average ~2.3). On-hand=0, in-transit=892 \u2014 significant pipeline but arrivals have varied; treat promised lead time as uncertain so use observed average lead time. Set L by averaging observed lead times to capture instability. Use recent_N=18 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the sustained higher-demand regime from Periods 5\u201322 so the (1+L)-scaled demand forecast and volatility reflect current demand. These parameters prioritize meeting high recent demand while the backend cap limits order size; monitoring for lost shipments should continue.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019/8/12). On-hand=0, in-transit=997. Historical arrivals show unstable lead times (many 1\u20133 periods; recent average \u22482.3) and a sustained higher demand regime from Period 5\u201322 (mean \u2248455 units). To reflect actual LT variability use 'calculate' so backend averages observed lead times. Forecast demand using the recent high-demand regime (Periods 5\u201322) so set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=18 (captures the elevated mean and volatility). This balances service (higher base stock for elevated demand) against holding cost given in-transit stock already high.

Period 26 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-19). Demand has remained in a higher regime since Period 5 (recent mean \u2248455/unit over P5\u2013P22). Observed lead times remain unstable with average \u22482.33 periods and frequent 1\u20133 period samples; in-transit=892 and on-hand=0 currently cover ~2.0 periods at recent demand, but (L+1)\u22483.33 periods would require \u22481518 units, so pipeline is short and policy should order. I set L explicitly to reflect the empirically observed average lead time (~2.33) rather than the promised 2, and I use recent_N (N=18) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor forecasts/volatility on the sustained higher-demand regime (Periods 5\u201322). These choices push the OR backend to raise target base-stock to meet the higher demand while accounting for observed LT instability and avoiding understocking.

Period 27 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/26 (Period 27). Demand showed a sustained high regime from Period 5\u201322 (mean \u2248455), but the last 3 periods (24\u201326) have fallen sharply (176,132,155). On-hand=0, in-transit=1560 units. Lead times observed historically are unstable (samples show 1\u20133 periods, recent average \u22482.33). To be responsive to unstable LT while reflecting the long higher-demand regime, I set L by averaging recent observed lead times and used recent-demand statistics over the higher-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This keeps target base-stock high enough for elevated demand but uses recent LT estimate so pipeline coverage matches observed arrival variability. Monitor for further demand decline (Periods 24\u201326) which may warrant lowering mu_hat if sustained.

Carry-over insight: New: Demand has softened since Period 24; Periods 24\u201326 mean demand = 154.33 (176,132,155). Treat as potential downshift\u2014monitor next 3 periods before committing to a lower sustained regime.

Period 28 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/2 (Period 28). Recent history shows an unstable actual lead time (mixed 1\u20133 periods) but average observed LT>2; on-hand=0, in-transit=1560 (pipeline sizable). Demand regime: long run elevated demand earlier, but demand has softened since Period 24 (recent samples low). To balance service vs holding cost: infer L from observed lead-time samples (letting backend compute avg observed LT), and forecast demand using the most recent 4 periods to capture the apparent downshift while pipeline stock provides short-term cover. Use recent_N for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These settings avoid over-ordering if the softening persists while allowing backend to respect observed lead-time behavior and current pipeline.

Use L='calculate' to reflect observed average LT rather than promised 2.

Period 30 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-16). Recent demand has softened vs. the summer peak: last 5 demands (Periods 25\u201329) = [132,155,139,78,65], mean \u2248 113.8. Inventory: on-hand=548, in-transit=869 -> pipeline+on-hand sufficient for near-term but lead time history is unstable (observed L samples show 1\u20133; average \u22482.3). I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses observed lead-time average from concluded history. For demand I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the apparent downshift (responsive to the last 5 samples). For volatility I also use recent_N N=5 to reflect recent lower variance. These choices reduce target base-stock to avoid excess holding given holding cost while still covering the shorter recent demand profile and the inferred average lead time.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand softening starting Period 24: Periods 25\u201329 mean \u2248 113.8 (samples: 132,155,139,78,65). Treat as new lower regime until contradicted.

Period 31 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/23 (Period 31). Recent history shows a confirmed demand downshift beginning Period 24 (Periods 25\u201329 mean \u2248113.8) and highly variable observed lead times (samples average \u22482.3, with L=1\u20133 observed and some delayed arrivals). On-hand=518, in-transit=869 provides substantial pipeline cover today. To account for unstable actual LT we let the backend infer L from observed concludes (method=calculate). For demand forecasting we use a recent-window that reflects the new lower regime: mu_hat recent_N N=5 (Periods 25\u201329) so (1+L)\xd7recent mean captures current lower demand. For volatility we use sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to reflect recent variability in the softened regime. This keeps orders aligned to the confirmed lower demand while allowing the OR engine to compute lead-time-adjusted safety stock; using recent windows limits over-ordering given many past delayed arrivals and the current ample pipeline.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-30). On-hand=483, in-transit=869. Historical concluded lead-times are variable (samples show 1\u20133, avg \u22482.33) so use calculate to let backend average observed LT. Demand has softened since Period 24 (periods 25\u201331 demands = 132,155,139,78,65,30,35); use recent_N with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new lower regime and reduced volatility. This keeps target stock aligned with the current low-demand regime while letting the OR engine compute safety stock from observed LT.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand softening starting Period 24: Periods 25\u201331 mean \u224899 (samples: 132,155,139,78,65,30,35). Lead times remain unstable (observed LT samples 1\u20133, avg \u22482.33); monitor for lost shipments if further non-arrivals occur.

Current inventory: on-hand=421, in-transit=869 (pipeline=1290). To avoid overstock given the sustained low-demand regime and volatile deliveries, set lead time via observed average (backend will compute) and base demand/volatility on the recent low-demand regime (Periods 25\u201332) so the OR engine sizes orders to cover (1+L) periods of the current lower demand while accounting for observed LT instability.

Recent demand has been in a lower regime since Period 24 (Periods 28\u201334 demands = [78,65,30,35,62,38,43], recent mean \u224849), while observed lead times remain unstable (many concluded LT samples averaging \u22482.3). On-hand=340 and in-transit=869 provide ample pipeline cover vs. the low recent demand. To reflect the unstable LT I use a calculated average lead time so the OR engine increases pipeline-aware ordering; to keep target stock aligned with the new low-demand regime I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 7 demand samples (captures the downshift and lower volatility). This reduces over-ordering given high on-hand/in-transit and accounts for LT variability via the calculated L.

Period 36 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-28). Recent data shows a sustained lower-demand regime since Period 24 (periods 25\u201335 recent samples: 132,155,139,78,65,30,35,62,38,43,50) and seasonally low swimwear demand in Oct. Observed lead times remain unstable (many concluded L=1\u20133) with sample average \u22482.33; to hedge against missed/variable arrivals use that as the best current LT estimate. Choose L explicit to reflect observed average LT\u22482.33. For demand forecasting, focus on the recent low-demand regime: use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=11 (Periods 25\u201335) so the OR engine targets the current lower mean and volatility rather than the historical high-season samples. This balances service (avoid overstock) versus holding cost given large on-hand (290) and healthy in-transit (869).

Period 37 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 37). Recent history shows demand softened starting Period 24 (Periods 25\u201336 low: 132,155,139,78,65,30,35,62,38,43,50,36) while earlier periods (5\u201323) were much higher. On-hand=254 and in-transit=869 (large pipeline) so we should not chase the prior high-demand regime. Lead time observations remain unstable (multiple concluded L=1\u20133; avg \u22482.33), so use the empirical average lead time. For demand forecast use a recent-window estimate reflecting the lower regime: choose recent_N over the last 12 demand samples (Periods 25\u201336) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the softer demand and reduced volatility. This keeps base_stock aligned to current low-demand regime and avoids overordering given already-large pipeline; using empirical L helps the backend account for lead-time instability.

Period 38 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-11-11). Demand has been in the lower regime since Period 24 (Periods 25\u201337 sample shows sustained low weekly demand); use recent demand samples to forecast. Lead times historically unstable (observed samples avg \u22482.3) so infer L from observed conclues rather than accepting promised blindly. On-hand=220 + in-transit=869 provides substantial pipeline but we still size base stock to the recent low-demand regime to avoid excess holding. Set L using observed average (backend will compute), set mu_hat and sigma_hat from recent regime (last 13 samples since the downshift at Period 24) so the OR engine targets service for the current lower-demand regime while accounting for observed lead-time behaviour.

Period 39 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/18 (Period 39). Recent history (Periods 25\u201338) shows a sustained downshift in demand since Period 24 with low weekly sales (examples: P25\u2013P38 demands = 132,155,139,78,65,30,35,62,38,43,50,36,34,42; on-hand=178, in-transit=869). Concluded arrivals show unstable actual lead times (observed samples 1\u20133 periods, average \u22482.33). To be robust I let the OR engine compute an empirical L from observed lead-time samples (method=calculate). For demand I use a recent-regime estimate to reflect the sustained lower demand since Period 24: use recent_N with N=14 (Periods 25\u201338) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect current low-demand volatility. This balances service (avoid stockouts if in-transit is delayed) with holding cost given sizable on-hand + in-transit inventory.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained demand softening starting Period 24: Periods 25\u201338 mean \u224850 units/week (samples listed P25\u2013P38); treat as new lower regime until contradicted. Lead time remains unstable with observed LT samples 1\u20133, average \u22482.33; monitor for lost shipments if further non-arrivals occur.

Period 40 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019/11/25). Demand has been in a sustained soft regime since Period 24 (recent weekly demands mostly 17\u201378, recent mean \u224850 over P25\u2013P38; Period39 demand=17, ending on-hand=161, in-transit=869). Historical concluded arrivals show unstable lead times (samples 1\u20133, average \u22482.33). To reflect observed lead-time variability use observed average; to capture the current low-demand regime use recent-sample estimates over the post-changepoint regime (Periods 24\u201339). These choices keep pipeline cover aligned to the longer empirical LT while sizing mu_hat/sigma_hat to the new low demand so the OR backend avoids overstocking given holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained demand softening starting Period 24 (Periods 25\u201338 mean \u224850 units/week); observed lead times remain unstable with samples in {1,2,3} and empirical average \u22482.33; monitor for lost shipments if further non-arrivals occur.

To reflect observed LT instability but leverage observed average, set L via 'calculate' so backend averages observed lead times. For demand, use recent_N over the full recent low-regime window (Periods 25\u201340, n=16) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the soft, lower-variance regime and avoid overstocking against prior summer peaks.

Period 42 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019/12/9). On-hand=0, in-transit=869. Historical concludes show highly unstable actual lead times (samples include 1\u20133 periods; empirical avg \u22482.33) and a clear demand downshift starting Period 24. Recent demand (Periods 25\u201341) is substantially lower than earlier periods. To reflect unstable LT while letting backend use observed history, set L to 'calculate' (avg observed LT). For demand forecast use a recent-regime estimate: use recent_N over the confirmed low-demand regime (Periods 25\u201341, n=17) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the new lower mean and volatility. This keeps pipeline sizing responsive to the current low-demand regime while L=calculate lets the OR engine adjust for actual lead-time behavior seen so far; together they reduce overstock risk given holding cost= $1 and unit profit=$2.

Carry-over insight: New sustained demand softening starting Period 24 confirmed (Periods 25\u201341, n=17, recent mean materially lower than earlier regimes). Observed lead times remain unstable with samples in {1,2,3} and empirical average \u22482.33; monitor for lost shipments if further non-arrivals occur.

Period 43 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/16 (Period 43). On-hand=0, in-transit=869. Historical concludes show unstable actual lead times (samples 1\u20133, empirical avg \u22482.33) and a sustained demand softening starting Period 24 (Periods 25\u201342 recent regime). I set L explicitly to 2.33 to reflect observed unstable-but-longer-than-1 LT so the OR backend will size pipeline for longer arrivals. For demand I use recent_N (N=18, Periods 25\u201342) to capture the confirmed lower-demand regime; sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=18) to reflect reduced variability in this regime. These choices prioritize avoiding overstock (holding cost $1) while covering (1+L) periods of the new lower demand to protect service given in-transit uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained demand softening starting Period 24 (use Periods 25\u201342, n=18, recent mean materially lower than earlier regimes). Observed lead times remain unstable with samples in {1,2,3} and empirical average \u22482.33; monitor for lost shipments if further non-arrivals occur.

Period 44 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (Period 44). Product is seasonal swimwear; current calendar (late Dec) is off-season for swim bottoms and recent observed demand has been in a sustained lower regime since Period 24. On-hand=0 but large in-transit=869 units (pipeline already covers multiple periods of recent demand). Historical concluded lead times are unstable (samples in {1,2,3}, empirical avg \u22482.3). To avoid excess inventory while the pipeline is large and demand is soft, use inferred average lead time for L and rely on backend's default demand aggregation for mu_hat/sigma_hat so the OR engine caps replenishment against pipeline. This balances service (respecting observed LT variability) and holding cost (avoid new orders given heavy in-transit).

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained demand softening starting Period 24 (Periods 25\u201343 recent mean materially lower than earlier regimes). Observed lead times remain unstable with samples in {1,2,3}, empirical average \u22482.33; monitor for lost shipments if further non-arrivals occur.

Period 45 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
2019/12/30 (Period 45). Recent history shows a sustained low-demand regime since Period 24 (recent weekly demand ~50\u201360 units). Pipeline=869, on-hand=0 \u2014 substantial inventory is already in transit (no recent conclude showing losses). Lead times historically unstable (observed samples ~1\u20133, mean \u22482.3). To respect observed LT variability but let backend use its promised LT, set L to be calculated from observed concludes so OR can learn the empirical mean LT. For demand, use a recent_N estimate focusing on the confirmed low-demand regime (use last 20 samples to capture Periods 25\u201344 behavior) so mu_hat reflects current lower demand; likewise use recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. This keeps orders conservative (pipeline already large) and limits extra holding cost while matching current low demand.
