OR recommendation (321) uses historical mean and promised lead time; it overestimates current demand regime. Decision rule: with L=0 we must cover current period demand (L+1=1); target order = recent mean + modest safety stock to avoid stockout while minimizing holding cost (holding=$1/unit/period). I choose a conservative safety buffer \u224820 units. Final action = 51 + 20 \u2248 71, round to 70 for simplicity and to avoid overstock.

{
  "rationale": "Lead time: concluded history shows actual lead time = 0 (all recent orders arrived same period). Inventory: on-hand=13, in-transit=0. Demand outlook: recent periods (P37\u2013P44) demands = [34,42,17,113,51,57,58,57], recent average \u224849 units/period and volatility moderate; no evidence of a renewed high summer spike. OR recommended 304 (uses long-past high-season samples) which would create large holding cost given current lower post-season demand. With L=0 an order arrives same period and can cover this period's demand; aim to satisfy one-period expected demand plus small buffer. Order decision: 50 units (arrives this period) \u2014 combined with on-hand 13 gives ~63 available to cover expected ~49 demand and a ~14-unit buffer without incurring excessive holding cost.",
