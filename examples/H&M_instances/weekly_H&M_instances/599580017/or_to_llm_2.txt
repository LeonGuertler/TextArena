Inventory & lead time: on-hand=0, in-transit=0, promised L=4 with no concluded arrivals yet, so no evidence of lost shipments or shorter lead time. Demand/seasonality: SKU is swimwear on 2019-02-25 (entering spring/summer season) \u2014 higher demand likely coming. Decision logic: OR's capped 225 is conservative relative to the 5-period demand (653) and may risk stockouts if demand stays near historical mean or rises seasonally. Holding cost is moderate ($1/unit/period) vs profit $2, so some extra safety stock is justified. Action chosen: increase OR's 225 to 300 units \u2014 a moderate upward override that raises pipeline coverage without incurring excessive holding cost.

Recent realized demand (Periods 29\u201334: 65,30,35,62,38,43) implies a low short-term mean (~45 units/period) and the previously computed 5-period recent means (~136 or lower) are conservative; current on-hand covers >> (L+1) periods of expected demand. OR recommendation: 0 units. Decision: follow OR and order 0. Reasoning: With lead time = 4, we must cover (L+1)=5 periods after ordering; current on-hand already covers many more periods even under higher recent means, so ordering risks high holding costs (holding $1/unit/period) that erode profit ($2/unit). No evidence of sustained demand spike or lost shipments that would justify ordering.

Economics: profit=$2, holding=$1 per unit/period \u2192 high carrying cost relative to profit favors avoiding extra stock. OR recommended 0 units; given large on-hand buffer, no in-transit replenishment, and confirmed L=4, placing orders now would only increase holding costs and risk overstock.
