Period 1 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25: swimwear entering spring season; recent demand shows uptick (history [61,98,152,129,213], last 3 mean \u2248164.7) so I bias forecasts toward recent higher demand. On-hand+in-transit=0 so we need coverage for (L+1) periods. Set L to promised (default) while using recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to react to the apparent regime shift (keeps pipeline sizing responsive to higher recent mean and volatility). This balances service level for a seasonal upswing against holding cost by relying on recent data rather than the longer-term average.

Carry-over insight: Recent demand regime upshift: last 3 samples mean\u2248164.7 vs overall mean\u2248130.6; treat as sustained until contradicted.

Period 2 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent demand shows an elevated regime (recent 3-sample mean ~172 units vs overall ~130); Period 1 concluded demand=175, reinforcing the upshift. On-hand=0, in-transit=237 (order placed last period not yet arrived). No concluded arrivals to infer a shorter/longer lead time, so keep promised lead time. Use a recent_N forecast (N=3) to capture the higher recent mean when computing (1+L) demand over the review+lead window. Keep sigma at default to let backend scale volatility with full sample set. This biases orders upward to cover the sustained higher demand while relying on backend cap to limit excessive over-ordering given holding cost.

Period 3 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 3). Swimwear SKU with profit $2 and holding $1. On-hand=0, in-transit=499 but no concluded arrivals in Periods 1\u20132 (ordered arrived=0) \u2014 signals possible delayed or lost shipments; therefore keep promised lead time rather than inferring from absent concludes. Demand shows recent upshift: last 3 samples mean \u2248164.7 vs overall mean \u2248130.6. To reflect the higher recent demand while remaining robust to limited history, set L=default (use promised 4), mu_hat based on recent_N (N=3) to capture the upshift, and sigma_hat recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent volatility. This increases target base-stock to improve service given elevated demand while acknowledging outstanding in-transit units.

Period 4 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (2019-03-18). On-hand=0, in-transit=724 (sum of orders placed Periods 1-3); promised lead time=4 so no concluded arrivals expected yet. Recent demand regime persists: last 3 samples mean\u2248164.7 > overall mean\u2248130.6, so use recent_N to capture uplift. Use L=default to respect promised lead time (no concluded lead-time evidence to change). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N N=3 to reflect the higher recent mean and volatility, which raises the backend base-stock and cap to improve service while acknowledging holding cost tradeoff.

Period 5 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 5). Recent demand regime upshift flagged (last 3 samples mean\u2248164.7 vs overall mean\u2248130.6). On-hand=0, in-transit=886 (large pipeline; prior orders from Periods 1\u20134 have not concluded \u2192 possible delayed/lost shipments). Because concluded arrivals are absent, I conservatively extend lead time to cover potential delays so the OR backend plans for a longer protection period. I use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent higher-demand regime (N=3 matches the detected changepoint). L explicit=6 lengthens coverage (decision now covers 1+L=7 periods) to avoid stockouts if some in-transit units are further delayed or lost. These choices increase target base_stock to raise service level during the high-demand regime while the large in-transit reduces immediate incremental ordering by the backend's capped policy.

Period 6 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date=2019-04-01 (Period 6). On-hand=0, in-transit=857. Concluded arrival in Period 5: 237 units (ordered Period 1, lead_time=4) \u2014 confirms promised L=4 so far. Recent demand has shifted up and is sustained: last 5 demands = [175,173,181,200,268], mean=199.4. I set L=default (use promised 4). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (regime_length=5). This raises the (1+L)-period forecast and volatility to improve service while avoiding excessive holding beyond the visible large pipeline (857 units).

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand upshift confirmed: last 5-period mean\u2248199.4 (periods 1\u20135 demands 175,173,181,200,268) vs earlier baseline; treat as new regime until contradicted.

Period 7 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08 (Period 7). Observed arrivals in concludes show actual lead time = 4 (Period5 arrival from P1, Period6 arrival from P2). Demand has clearly upshifted \u2014 recent 5-period mean \u2248199.4 (P1\u2013P5: 175,173,181,200,268) and P6 demand=376 reinforces higher regime. On-hand=0, in-transit=774 (covers several periods). To capture the sustained higher demand while OR backend expects (1+L) demand aggregation, set L via calculated observed lead times and set mu_hat/sigma_hat using the recent 5-period regime so the base-stock and cap reflect the new higher mean and volatility. This also avoids over-reaction to older low-demand samples and compensates for earlier delayed arrivals (no lost shipments detected).

Period 8 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15. Recent demand regime is elevated vs earlier history: recent concluded demands (Periods 3\u20137) = [181,200,268,376,295], mean\u2248264 and higher variance. On-hand=0, in-transit=929 (pipeline large; prior orders have consistently arrived with 4-period lead time). Use observed lead-time average to reflect actual behavior and use recent_N=5 for demand forecast/volatility to capture the sustained upshift and higher variability. This balances service (avoid stockouts during high demand) against holding cost by letting backend compute base_stock from recent elevated mean and variance.

Period 9 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/22 (Period 9). Recent sustained demand upshift confirmed (Period 6 insight): use the most recent 5-period regime for demand. Observed concluded lead times = 4 periods for prior arrivals, so infer actual lead time average = 4. On-hand=0, in-transit=1160 which covers ~5 periods at the elevated mean (~199.4\xd75\u2248997), so no emergency extra supply needed. Choices: L by calculate to lock to observed lead time; mu_hat recent_N with N=5 to capture the confirmed upshift regime; sigma_hat default to use full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances service (higher mean forecast) while avoiding overstating volatility.

Period 10 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/29. Concluded arrivals show consistent observed lead_time=4 periods (Periods 5\u20139 conclusions report orders from Periods 1\u20135 arriving with W=4), so use calculated lead time. Recent demand has accelerated sharply; last 5 realized demands (Periods 5\u20139) = [268,376,295,367,477], mean\u2248356.6 \u2014 treat as the current regime to size review+lead demand. On-hand=0, in-transit=1391 (covers part of upcoming demand) so choose recent_N for mu_hat/sigma_hat to force the OR engine to target a much higher base-stock appropriate for the new high-demand regime while relying on calculated L to reflect observed delivery timing.

Carry-over insight: Recent sustained demand upshift: last 5-period mean\u2248356.6 (Periods 5\u20139 demands 268,376,295,367,477) \u2014 treat as new regime until contradicted.

Period 11 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-05-06). Recent demand regime remains elevated: last 5 demands (Periods 5\u20139) average \u2248356.6; profit=2, holding=1 so service level target is moderate. On-hand=0, in-transit=1683 \u2014 with observed concluded arrivals, realized lead times = 4 periods repeatedly. I set L by calculating the average observed lead time (confirming 4). For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the sustained upshift (regime length=5). I also set sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices ensure the OR backend targets a base-stock appropriate for the higher recent demand while using recent volatility to size safety stock; large in-transit (1683) will be reconciled by the backend's pipeline term so we avoid over-ordering.

Period 12 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-05-13). Recent demand regime remains elevated per history: last 5 realized demands (Periods 7\u201311 sold/demand context) and carry-over insight show sustained upshift (last-5 mean \u2248356.6). Observed concluded lead times = 4 for all arrived orders \u2192 no change to promised L. To capture the confirmed higher demand and recent volatility, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (reflects the most recent regime). This increases target base-stock to improve service while sigma recent_N captures elevated variability; keeping L=default avoids underestimating pipeline given consistent 4-period actual lead times. No evidence of lost shipments beyond normal delays.

Period 13 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20 (Period 13). Recent demand regime remains elevated (Period 8\u201312 mean \u2248412 units/period). All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 4 periods (no lost shipments). On-hand 24 + in-transit 1577 = 1601 units, which is below the (L+1)-period demand implied by the recent regime (~5\xd7412=2060) so pipeline is short by \u2248459 units. To match the confirmed high-demand regime while keeping the OR engine aligned with observed lead time, use promised/observed L and base forecasts from the most recent 5 demands. This gives the backend a (1+L)-period mean based on the most recent regime and a matching recent volatility estimate to size safety stock and cap appropriately.

Period 15 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03 (Period 15). Recent demand regime remains elevated (most recent 5 demands: 268,376,295,367,477 => sustained upshift). Observed lead times in concluded messages are consistently 4 periods (no lost shipments). Choose L=default to trust promised lead time=4. Use mu_hat recent_N N=5 to capture the elevated recent mean ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 samples) so base stock reflects current high-demand regime. Use sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility and keep safety stock aligned with recent variability. These choices prioritize service for the confirmed higher-demand regime while keeping holding cost sensitivity via sigma estimation.

Period 16 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:

Concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=4 (no lost shipments). To capture the elevated regime and keep service while lead time remains promised=4, set L to default (promised 4). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets the current high mean and observed volatility over the most relevant regime, reducing stockouts while avoiding excessive long-term holding.

Period 17 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/17. Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime (confirmed lead_time=4 in concluded messages). On-hand=74, in-transit=1676 \u2192 ample pipeline (covers many future periods) and no evidence of lost shipments. I set L to default (promised lead time=4) because all concluded arrivals show lead_time=4. Demand is in a new high regime; to capture the most recent demand level and volatility I use recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (focuses forecast/uncertainty on the latest regime). This raises target base-stock to improve service in the high-demand period while sigma_hat recent_N captures current variability to size safety stock appropriately given holding cost tradeoff.

Period 18 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/24 (Period 18). Recent demand remains well above early-baseline: last 5 realized demands (Periods 13\u201317 = 370,525,330,302,517) average \u2248408.8. On-hand=73, in-transit=1439 \u2014 ample pipeline but we must size target over review+lead to match elevated demand while avoiding excess holding. All concluded arrivals show consistent 4-period actual lead time; use promised lead time. I set L=default to keep lead-time at promised 4. For demand I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the confirmed high-demand regime (N chosen = 5 = recent regime length). For sigma I also use recent_N N=5 to reflect current volatility. These parameters steer the OR engine toward a larger base-stock to meet the sustained high demand while letting the capped order limit and high pipeline temper immediate over-ordering.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand upshift confirmed through Period 17: last 5-period mean (Periods 13\u201317) \u2248408.8 vs earlier regimes; treat as new high-demand regime until contradicted.

Period 19 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:

Recent demand regime remains elevated \u2014 last 5 demands (Periods 14\u201318 = 525,330,302,517,771) mean=499, indicating sustained high-demand regime. On-hand=0, in-transit=1643 (large pipeline covering multiple periods). Choose L=default to keep lead-time assumption at promised 4; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture the new high-demand regime and higher volatility so the OR backend raises base-stock while capping orders per its cap formula, leveraging the large in-transit to avoid over-ordering.

Period 20 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/8 (Period 20). Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime (Periods 15\u201319 demands = 330,302,517,771,592; 5-period mean \u2248502.4). All concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (orders placed arrive after 4 periods). Current on-hand=0, in-transit=1893 \u2192 pipeline covers ~3.8 weeks at the recent mean, which is short of (L+1)=5 periods of protection. To prioritize service during the confirmed high-demand regime, set L to promised/default (actual=4 confirmed) and use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend sizes base-stock and cap around the latest high-demand mean and volatility. This increases ordered quantity to cover the (L+1) review+lead demand while avoiding overreliance on older, lower-demand samples.

Recent demand regime remains elevated (sustained upshift confirmed through Period 18 and continued high demands in Periods 19\u201321); to capture this, set mu_hat using recent_N=5 (focus on most recent high-demand window). Use sigma_hat recent_N=5 to reflect recent volatility rather than long-run lower variance. On-hand=0, in-transit=2607 provides substantial pipeline coverage; using recent demand inputs avoids underordering given the sustained high-demand regime while sigma based on recent samples keeps safety-stock aligned with current variability.

=== Period 23 Summary ===
599580017: ordered=778, arrived=799 units (ordered on Period 19, lead_time was 4 periods), starting on-hand inventory=799, demand=309, sold=309, ending on-hand inventory=490

Daily Reward (R_t): $128.00

Period 24 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-08-05). Recent demand is in a sustained high regime (last 5 demands mean \u2248532.6). Current pipeline (on-hand 490 + in-transit 2434 = 2924) comfortably covers a 5-period review+lead forecast, so use a recent-5 demand estimate to capture the current regime while avoiding excess ordering. Use promised lead time (default) and default volatility estimate.

Period 25 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-08-12). Observed pipeline strong: on-hand=1120, in-transit=1628. Historical concludes show consistent 4-period lead times (arrivals repeatedly labeled lead_time=4), so use promised/default lead time. Demand has been in a sustained high regime; recent 5 demands (Periods 20-24 = 542,510,710,309,176) imply a high short-term mean and volatility \u2014 use recent_N with N=5 to capture current regime and keep orders responsive to latest demand. This balances service (reduce stockouts during high season) vs holding cost given large existing inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-1144.00

Period 26 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-19). Demand has undergone sustained upshifts historically and observed lead times have consistently been 4 periods (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=4). Current stock is very high: on-hand=1408 and in-transit=1208, which already covers many future periods at elevated demand, so avoid inflating forecasts. Use promised lead time (default) and default demand/volatility estimates so the OR engine applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std on full history; this limits new ordering given large pipeline and reduces holding cost risk. No evidence of lost shipments or lead-time regime change to justify explicit adjustments.

Period 27 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-26). Concluded history shows consistent 4-period arrivals (orders arriving with lead_time=4), so use promised lead time (default). Demand has been in a sustained high regime since Period 18; to capture the current regime I use recent_N with N=9 (covers the most recent 9 demand observations since the changepoint). On-hand (1683) + in-transit (778) = 2461 units, which comfortably covers multiple periods of current high demand but we still set forecasts from recent data so the OR backend balances service level vs holding cost.

Period 28 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-09-02). Recent demand has fallen from earlier peaks; last 5 concluded demands (Periods 23-27) = [309,176,132,155,139] \u2192 mean \u2248182.2. On-hand = 2322, in-transit = 0; large on-hand inventory covers many periods so we should not inflate forecast. Observed lead times in concluded history are consistently 4 periods. Choices: set L to default (promised 4) because concluded lead_time observations match promise; set mu_hat to recent_N (N=5) to base the (1+L) forecast on the latest low-demand regime and avoid over-ordering given high on-hand; set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent demand volatility. This keeps OR base-stock conservative to reduce holding cost while maintaining service for near-term demand covered by current on-hand.

Recent demand has fallen (last 5 demands: 176,132,155,139,78) so reduce forecast by using recent_N for mu_hat (N=5) to avoid excess holding cost given holding>profit.

Period 30 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-16). On-hand=2179, in-transit=0. Recent demand has fallen sharply since summer: last 5-period demands (Periods 25\u201329) = [132,155,139,78,65], mean\u2248113.8 vs prior high-season means >>300. No pipeline arrivals expected (in-transit=0) and seasonality (post-summer for swimwear) supports a sustained downshift. I set L=default to trust the promised 4-period lead time (no concluded late/lost orders in recent history). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the recent low-demand regime and reduce future ordering; this will lower base-stock and cap orders to avoid excess holding given high on-hand inventory and $1 holding cost relative to $2 profit.

Period 31 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-23 (Period 31). On-hand=2149, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistent actual lead_time=4 in past arrivals; no evidence of lost shipments. Recent demand has dropped sharply over the last 5 periods (Periods 26\u201330: 155,139,78,65,30; mean\u224893.4) indicating a new low-demand regime (seasonal tail-off). To avoid excess holding cost, use promised lead time and calibrate demand estimates to the recent low regime: set L=default to keep using promised 4; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture the recent downshift in mean and volatility.

Carry-over insight: New sustained demand downshift confirmed (Periods 26\u201330 mean\u224893.4 vs prior high regimes); treat as new low-demand regime until contradicted.

Period 32 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:

Historical conclues show consistent 4-period actual lead times earlier, so keep promised lead time. To avoid high holding cost, forecast demand using the most recent short-run regime: use recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets lower replenishment aligned with the recent low-demand regime while L stays at the promised value.

Promised lead time = 4 has been reliable historically (observed lead_time=4 for concluded arrivals). To avoid ordering into excess inventory while letting the OR backend anticipate the current low demand regime, set L=default (use promised 4); set mu_hat based on the most recent 5 demands to capture the downshift; set sigma_hat based on the same 5-sample window to reflect current volatility.

Period 36 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019/10/28). Recent regime: sustained demand downshift since Period 31 (periods 31\u201335 demands = 35,62,38,43,50; mean \u224845.6). On-hand = 1921, in-transit = 0 and supplier has sent no new arrivals since Period 27 (orders=0 from P24\u2013P35) \u2014 current pipeline is empty and inventory is ample versus current low demand. I keep L = promised (default = 4) because observed concluded lead times historically are 4 and there is no new concluded evidence to infer a different lead time. Set mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 to reflect the new low-demand regime (use last 5 realized demands to avoid over-ordering against legacy high-demand samples). Set sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to reflect reduced volatility in the recent low regime. These choices steer the OR engine to target much lower replenishment (protecting against holding cost given very high on-hand) while still covering short-term demand.

Period 37 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/4 (Period 37). Historical concluded lead times have been consistently 4 periods; no recent concl. contradicting promised lead time. On-hand is 1885, in-transit 0 \u2014 current inventory comfortably covers several periods of the recently observed low demand. Demand has shifted to a low regime since Period 31 (recent demands: Periods 32\u201336 = 62,38,43,50,36; 5-period mean \u224845.8). To avoid excess holding cost while maintaining service, use promised lead time and base-stock inputs driven by the most recent 5-period demand regime (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine sizes orders to the current low-demand regime.

Period 38 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-11-11). On-hand=1851, in-transit=0; inventory is very high and recent demand has been in a sustained low regime since Period 31 (recent demands P33\u2013P37 = [38,43,50,36,34], mean \u224840.2). No arrivals expected (pipeline=0). Use promised lead time (default) because concluded history consistently shows 4-period arrivals when present. Set demand forecast to recent regime to avoid new receipts: use recent_N on the last 5 observed demands (N=5) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(last 5) reflecting the low-demand regime; set sigma_hat to recent_N N=5 to capture current low volatility. This minimizes additional ordering into an already large on-hand position while matching observed low demand.

Period 39 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-18). On-hand=1809, in-transit=0. No arrivals expected (no recent orders in pipeline); observed lead times historically =4 when orders arrived, so keep promised lead time. Demand has been in the low regime since Period 31; last 5 demands (Periods 34\u201338) = [43,50,36,34,42], mean\u224841. I choose L=default to use promised 4-period lead time. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to anchor the backend forecast to the current low-demand regime (captures (1+L)\xd7recent mean and volatility) so orders will be sized conservatively to avoid excess holding cost while preserving service for the current low demand.

Period 40 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 40). On-hand is very high (1792) and in-transit=0; historical conclude messages consistently show lead_time=4 periods for arrived orders. No evidence of recent lost shipments or lead-time change. To avoid additional stock buildup, use the backend defaults so the optimizer computes replenishment from full-sample stats (it will naturally cap orders given current pipeline). Methods chosen: L=default (promised 4), mu_hat=default ((1+L)\xd7mean all samples), sigma_hat=default (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std all samples).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-1453.00

Period 41 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/2 (Period 41). Recent demand has remained in the low post-Period-31 regime: last 5 demands (Periods 36\u201340) = [36,34,42,17,113], mean\u224848.4, variance low relative to earlier high-demand regimes. On-hand=1679, in-transit=0 \u2014 large stock relative to current demand, so prioritize reducing future receipts. No concluded late arrivals recently (many arrived=0 after Period 27), but historical lead times when arrivals occurred averaged 4; missing arrivals likely reflect no orders rather than extended lead time. I therefore keep L at the promised/default to let the OR engine assume standard lead time, but I force demand inputs to reflect the recent low regime so the optimizer will reduce replenishment. Methods chosen: mu_hat recent_N with N=5 to capture the current low-demand regime; sigma_hat recent_N with N=5 to reflect recent volatility. This reduces target base-stock and cap, minimizing holding costs given large on-hand and no pipeline.

Period 42 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-12-9). Recent history shows a sustained low-demand regime since Period 24 (weekly demands mostly 176\u219251 range, recent samples periods 24\u201341 show low mean) and no in-transit inventory (in-transit=0) while on-hand is high (1628). All concluded arrivals historically show lead_time=4. To avoid overstock holding cost while covering (1+L) periods, keep L at the promised/default value and estimate demand/volatility from the recent low-demand regime. I choose recent_N with N=18 (periods 24\u201341) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current low-demand regime and reduce reorder quantities accordingly.

Period 43 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-16). Recent history shows a sustained low-demand regime since Period 31 (recent demands: 42,17,113,51,57; last 5 mean \u224856) and no in-transit inventory (on-hand=1571, in-transit=0). Observed lead times for concluded arrivals remain 4 periods historically. Given large on-hand cover and a confirmed downshift, set L to default (promised 4). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to align the OR backend to the current low-demand regime and avoid placing large replenishment while on-hand is ample. This prevents excess holding cost while maintaining service for near-term demand.

Period 44 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================

No in-transit inventory and no recent arrivals (all past orders concluded), so no evidence of lost shipments. Choose L=default to trust promised 4-period lead time (historical concluded lead_times =4). Set mu_hat via recent_N (N=5) to target the current low-demand regime ((1+L)\xd7recent mean). Set sigma_hat via recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility and avoid overstating uncertainty from older high-demand periods.

Period 45 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:

Demand regime: sustained low-demand regime since Period 31 (periods 31\u201344 show low weekly sales). To avoid overstock holding cost while matching current demand, I use promised lead time (default) and recent_N estimates for demand and volatility using the recent low-demand regime. recent_N N=14 covers Periods 31\u201344 to capture the current regime. These parameters bias orders toward lower forecasted replenishment while the backend enforces caps and service-level tradeoffs.
