Period 1 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (late Feb): swimwear demand is rising into spring; historical series [61,98,152,129,213] shows a recent uptick. No concluded arrivals or pipeline; on-hand=0. Use promised lead time (0) since no arrival history to infer otherwise. Capture the recent upward regime by using recent_N=3 for demand estimates (last three demands: 152,129,213 -> mean=164.6667) so mu_hat=(1+L)*recent_mean=164.6667. Use recent_N=3 for volatility to reflect recent variability (sample std \u224843.4280, sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std = 43.4280). These parameters bias the OR engine toward higher service (covering near-term spring uplift) while not overstating variance.

Carry-over insight: Recent demand regime increased: last 3-period mean=164.67 vs full-sample mean=130.60; treat as upward demand regime until contradicted.

Period 2 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. SKU 599580017 (swimwear bottom). On-hand=9, in-transit=0. Last period concluded an order arrived with lead_time=0, so use promised/default lead time. Historical demands show a recent upshift (last 3-mean=164.67 > full-sample mean=130.60); I adopt a recent_3 regime for demand forecasting. Therefore set L=0 (default), mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last 3 demands)=164.6667 to capture the higher recent demand, and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(last 3)=35.441 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters raise the base-stock to cover the new regime and reduce stockouts while keeping holding cost in mind given modest holding/profit ratio.

Period 3 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. Two concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (orders from Periods 1\u20132 arrived with lead_time 0). Recent-demand regime persists: last-3 mean (164.67) > full-sample mean (130.60) per carry-over. I set L = calculate (avg observed lead times = 0) to reflect fast replenishment. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=3) to capture the upward demand regime: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last3) = 164.6667 units; sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(last3) = 43.414 (sample std) to reflect observed volatility. These parameters increase the base-stock to meet the higher short-run demand while keeping variability estimates aligned with recent data, balancing service level vs. holding cost.

Period 4 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. Product: womens swimwear bottoms \u2014 seasonal demand rising into spring; recent data shows an upward demand regime (recent 3-period mean=164.67 vs full-sample mean=130.60). Concluded history shows all past orders arrived with lead_time=0 (Periods 1-3). Current inventory: on-hand=16, in-transit=0 \u2014 far below expected single-period demand (~165), so we must replenish to cover (1+L) periods. Decisions: set L by averaging observed lead times (calculate) => 0 (confirmed by three concluded 0-period arrivals). Forecast demand using recent_N (N=3) to capture upward regime: mu_hat=(1+L)*mean(last3)=164.6667. Volatility estimated from recent N=3 samples: sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std(last3)=43.411. These parameters raise the base-stock to reflect higher recent demand (improves service level) while using recent volatility to avoid excessive safety stock and holding cost.

Period 5 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Recent-demand regime persists: last-3 demand mean = 164.67 > full-sample mean 130.60 (Period 1 carry-over noted).

Period 6 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 historically, so use promised L=0. Recent demand has increased: last 3-period demands (Periods 3-5) = [181,200,268], mean=216.333. This exceeds the full-sample mean over Periods1-5 (199.4), indicating an upward demand regime; use recent_N=3 to capture it. Set mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_last3 = 216.333 to raise the base-stock to meet higher short-term demand. Set sigma_hat using recent_N=3 sample volatility (std_sample \u224845.740) to reflect increased demand variability and avoid understocking. On-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so aggressive replenishment to recent demand level is warranted. No evidence of lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Upward demand regime confirmed: last 3-period mean (Periods 3-5) = 216.33 vs full-sample mean (Periods1-5) = 199.40; maintain recent_N=3 forecasting until contradicted.

Period 9 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/22. Historical conclude messages show all past orders arrived with lead_time=0 (Periods1-8), so L is estimated as average observed = 0. Demand shows an upward regime; recent 3-period mean (Periods 6-8 demands = 376,295,367) = 346 units, which we use for forecasting (recent_N=3) as prior carry-over flagged and confirmed an upward shift. Set mu_hat = (1+L)*recent_mean = 346 to target service for the current review+lead window. Volatility estimated from the same recent 3 samples (sample std \u2248 44.40) -> sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std = 44.40 to reflect current variability without diluting with older, lower-demand data. These parameters increase supply to meet the confirmed higher demand while keeping holding exposure limited by using a short, recent window and L=0.

Period 10 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29. Recent demand has accelerated (Periods 7-9 = 295, 367, 477); concluded arrivals show lead time = 0 historically. I use a recent_N=3 demand estimate to capture the confirmed upward regime and keep L=0 (average of observed lead times). This raises base demand forecast to match latest spike while sigma uses the same recent window to reflect increased volatility; parameters aim to prioritize service (profit > holding cost) during this high-demand regime while avoiding excessive hold on-hand given zero on-hand and zero in-transit.

Period 12 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13. Recent demand regime remains materially higher than earlier periods. Concluded history shows consistent 0-period actual lead time. I use a recent_N=3 demand estimate (most recent periods 9-11: demands 477, 468, 332) to capture the upward regime and avoid understocking. L uses observed lead times (all concluded = 0). mu_hat set to (1+L)*recent_mean to target service for the immediate review+lead window. sigma_hat uses recent_N=3 sample volatility (scaled by sqrt(1+L)) to reflect current demand variability. These settings raise the base-stock to meet high recent demand while acknowledging holding cost (profit/holding = 2), balancing higher service level against inventory cost.

Carry-over insight: Upward demand regime maintained: recent_N=3 mean=425.67 (Periods 9-11) vs full-sample mean (~299.27 across concluded history); treat recent_N=3 forecasting until contradicted.

Period 14 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27. No late or lost arrivals in concluded history: all concluded lead_times = 0 => use promised L=0. Recent-demand regime persists (Periods 11-13 demands = [332,417,370], mean=373.0) so use recent_N=3 forecasting as prior carry-over indicates upward shift. On-hand=66, in-transit=0 \u2014 current pipeline is zero so orders must cover this period's demand plus desired safety. Set L=0 (promised), mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_last3 = 373.0 to center base-stock on the elevated recent mean, and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*sample_std_last3 = 42.588 to reflect observed short-run volatility. These parameters bias the OR backend toward higher replenishment to avoid stockouts during the confirmed higher-demand regime while capturing observed volatility to limit excessive safety stock given holding cost.

Period 15 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03 (Period 15). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead_time=0 each period so use promised lead_time. Recent demand regime remains elevated; last 3 periods (Periods 12-14) demands = [417, 370, 525], mean=430.6667, sample std\u224879.894. Set L=0 (default). Use recent_N=3 forecasting for mu_hat = (1+L)*mean = 430.6667 to capture the sustained upward regime and reduce stockouts. Use recent_N=3 sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*sample_std = 79.894 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters raise base-stock appropriately (z* based on profit/(profit+holding)=2/3) to balance service (avoid lost sales in high season) versus holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Maintain upward demand regime: recent_N=3 mean=430.67 (Periods 12-14 demands 417,370,525) vs earlier full-sample lower; continue recent_N=3 forecasting until contradicted.

Period 16 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/10 Period 16. History shows actual lead time = 0 in all concluded periods. Recent demand regime remains elevated; last 3 demands (Periods 13-15 = 370, 525, 330) have mean 408.33 vs full-sample mean ~299.3. On-hand=142, in-transit=0; with L=0 the OR policy should cover ~1 period of demand. I set L to default (promised=0). For demand forecast I use recent_N=3 to capture the confirmed upward regime: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last3)=408.333. Volatility uses recent_N=3: sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(last3)=84.077. These parameters bias ordering toward higher service (covering elevated recent demand) while the OR engine's cap will limit extreme orders.

Carry-over insight: Upward demand regime maintained: recent_N=3 mean=408.33 (Periods 13-15 = 370,525,330) vs full-sample mean ~299.27; continue recent_N=3 forecasting until contradicted.

Period 17 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/17. History shows all concluded arrivals had lead_time=0 so use promised lead time. Recent demand regime remains elevated; last 3 concluded demands (Periods 14-16 = 525, 330, 302) average 385.67 vs full-sample mean ~299.27. I set L using default (promised=0). Forecast mu_hat uses recent_N=3 to capture the sustained upward regime: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last3)=385.6667. Volatility sigma_hat uses recent_N=3 sample std scaled by sqrt(1+L): sigma_hat = 121.4599. These choices bias the base-stock toward higher coverage to avoid stockouts given the clear upward shift while keeping sigma realistic to limit excessive safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Upward demand regime maintained: recent_N=3 mean=385.67 (Periods 14-16 demands 525,330,302) vs full-sample mean ~299.27; continue recent_N=3 forecasting until contradicted.

Period 18 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24 (Period 18). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 and recent concluded history shows lead_time=0 every period (orders ordered and arrived same period). Demand regime: recent_N=3 maintained per prior insights (Periods 15-17 demands = 330, 302, 517) showing elevated demand vs older history. I set L to promised (0) because concluded messages consistently show 0 lead time. I use recent_N=3 forecasting for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the upward demand regime; mu_hat = mean(330,302,517)=383.0 units for the review+lead period (1+L=1). Sigma_hat = sample stddev of those three = 116.86. These parameters raise the base-stock to meet high near-term demand while sigma captures volatility to avoid excessive stock given holding cost $1 vs profit $2.

Carry-over insight: Maintain upward demand regime (recent_N=3). Evidence: Periods 15-17 demands = 330,302,517; recent 3-period mean=383.0 > earlier full-sample means; continue recent_N=3 forecasting until contradicted.

Period 19 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/29 (Period 23). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. All concluded arrivals (Periods 1\u201322) show lead_time=0 \u2192 use promised/default L=0. Demand has been in an elevated regime; use full-sample statistics (Periods 1\u201322) for stability but note recent high demand is visible in history. Chosen L=0 (default). mu_hat set to (1+L)*mean(all 22 samples)=403.5 units to replenish to expected period demand. sigma_hat set to sample std over the 22 concluded demands = 167.9 to reflect observed volatility. These parameters provide the OR backend a balanced base-stock (service vs holding) given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

Period 24 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-08-05): no new news; historical concluded lead times have all been 0 \u2192 use default promised L=0. Recent demand regime remains elevated; last 3 concluded demands (Periods 21-23 = 510,710,309) give mean=509.67, well above earlier full-sample means. On-hand=125, in-transit=0 so we must order to cover current period demand plus replenish for elevated regime. Set L=default(0). Use recent_N=3 forecasting for mu_hat to capture the sustained upward shift; use recent_N=3 std for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility. These parameters raise the base-stock to improve service (higher profit per unit) while sigma_hat captures uncertainty to avoid excessive overstocks.

Carry-over insight: Maintain upward demand regime: recent_N=3 mean=509.67 (Periods 21-23 demands 510,710,309) vs prior full-sample mean ~299.27; continue recent_N=3 forecasting until contradicted.

Period 25 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 25). All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 historically; no overdue shipments. Recent demand regime maintained but has softened vs earlier peaks. I use promised lead time (default L=0). For demand I use recent_N=3 to track the current regime (Periods 22-24 demands = 710, 309, 176) giving mean 398.333 units for the (1+L) review+lead period. Volatility estimated from the same 3-point window (population std = 226.987). These settings keep the OR engine focused on the recent demand level (improves service during sustained high demand) while sigma captures elevated variability to avoid stockouts.

Period 26 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/19 (Period 26). On-hand=387, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times all =0 (every concluded arrival states lead_time was 0), so use promised/observed lead time L=0. Recent demand has softened: last 3 demands (Periods 23-25) = [309,176,132], recent mean=205.67 versus longer-run higher means; I choose recent_N=3 to capture the latest regime change. Set mu_hat = (1+L)*recent_3_mean to reflect immediate demand trend and avoid excess inventory given holding cost. Set sigma_hat from recent 3-sample volatility (population std scaled by sqrt(1+L)) to reflect observed dispersion for safety stock. These parameters bias ordering toward covering near-term demand while limiting holding cost.

Period 27 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26. Historical concluded lead times = 0 every period so keep L=promised (0). Recent demand has dropped sharply vs prior upward regime: last 3 concluded demands (Periods 24-26 = 176,132,155) give mean 154.33 vs prior full-sample mean ~299. Use recent_N=3 forecasting to rapidly adapt. Set mu_hat = (1+L)*recent_mean = 154.33 to reflect current lower demand and avoid excess holding; set sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(recent 3) = 22.0 to represent observed short-term volatility. These choices reduce overstock risk given 0 in-transit and 232 on-hand while preserving serviceability for the next period.

Carry-over insight: New downward demand regime detected: recent_N=3 mean=154.33 (Periods 24-26 demands 176,132,155) vs prior full-sample mean ~299.27; switch to recent_N=3 forecasting until contradicted.

Period 28 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/2. Recent demand regime has shifted downward (Periods 24-26 mean=154.33; most recent 3 demands Periods 25-27 = [132,155,139], mean=142.0). All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 historically. On-hand=93, in-transit=0 so pipeline=93. I set L to promised (0). I use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the new lower-demand regime and avoid overstocking as seasonality cools. This gives mu_hat=(1+L)*mean_recent=142.0 and sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std_recent\u224811.79. These parameters lower the base-stock target and thus orders (base_stock \u2248 mu_hat + z*\u03c3 with q=2/(2+1)=0.6667 -> z\u22480.431), balancing service against $1/unit holding cost given current lower demand and available on-hand stock.

Carry-over insight: New downward demand regime detected: recent_N=3 mean=154.33 (Periods 24-26) with latest 3-period mean=142.0 (Periods 25-27 = 132,155,139); switch to recent_N=3 forecasting until contradicted.

Period 29 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/9 (Period 29). Promised lead time=0 and historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time=0 consistently. Inventory: on-hand=70, in-transit=0 \u2014 adequate short-term stock but below recent demand levels if regime were high. Recent demand shows a downward regime: last 3 concluded demands (Periods 26-28 = 155,139,78) mean=124.0 with std\u224833.17. I set L to promised (0) given consistent zero lead times. I use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent downward shift (more responsive than full-sample). mu_hat = (1+L)*recent_mean = 124.0 units (covers current-period demand). sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*recent_std = 33.17. These parameters lower the base-stock to match reduced demand, avoiding excess holding cost while keeping service for the now-lower demand regime.

Period 30 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-16. On-hand=77, in-transit=0. Recent demand has shifted down sharply: last 3 concluded demands (Periods 27-29) = [139,78,65], recent 3-mean=94.0 which is well below prior full-sample and previously-detected regimes. All concluded lead-times have been 0. I set L to promised/default (0) since concluded history shows lead_time=0. For demand I use recent_N=3 to capture the new low-demand regime: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last3)=94.0. For volatility I also use recent_N=3: sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(last3)=~32.27. These parameters reduce target base-stock and cap order sizes to avoid excess holding cost given the clear drop in demand while keeping service for near-term demand.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed new downward demand regime: recent_N=3 mean=94.0 (Periods 27-29 demands 139,78,65) vs earlier higher regimes; use recent_N=3 forecasting until contradicted.

Period 31 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-23 (Period 31). Recent demand has shifted to a clear downward regime: the last 3 demands (Periods 28-30 = 78, 65, 30) average 57.67, well below prior periods. Historical lead times in concluded history are consistently 0 periods (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0). On-hand=82, in-transit=0. I adopt L=default (promised 0) since concluded lead-time observations confirm 0. For demand I use recent_N=3 to capture the new low-demand regime: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last3) to reduce ordering to match current low demand and avoid excess holding cost. I set sigma_hat from the last 3 samples to reflect reduced but still material volatility. These settings bias the OR backend toward a low base stock (keep service but limit holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1).

Period 32 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-30. Recent data show a sustained downward demand regime. Last 3 concluded demands (Periods 29-31 = 65,30,35) give mean=43.333 and std\u224818.925. On-hand=47, in-transit=0 \u2192 low pipeline. Promised lead time has consistently concluded as 0. I use L=0 (default), mu_hat via recent_N=3 to capture the new low regime, and sigma_hat via recent_N=3 to reflect reduced volatility. These params keep target inventory close to the recent low demand (reducing holding cost) while covering the current-period demand after ordering.

Period 33 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-07 (Period 33). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 consistently; recent demand has shifted to a low regime. Recent 3-period demands (Periods 30-32 = 30, 35, 62) give mean 42.33, supporting a recent_N=3 forecast. I set L to the promised/default (0) because all concluded lead times = 0. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=3 to be responsive to the new low-demand regime, keeping inventory lean to avoid holding costs while covering expected demand this period.

Carry-over insight: Maintain downward demand regime: recent_N=3 mean=42.33 (Periods 30-32 demands 30,35,62); use recent_N=3 forecasting until contradicted.

Period 34 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-14 (Period 34). History shows consistent zero concluded lead times (all concluded arrivals report lead_time=0). Recent demand regime is the downward regime described in carry-over notes: last 3 concluded demands (Periods 31-33 = 35,62,38) give a recent mean \u224845 units, well below earlier high-season means. On-hand=12, in-transit=0 \u2192 current coverage is low versus expected next-period demand. Set L to promised (0) because all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0. Use recent_N=3 for mu_hat to capture the established downward regime and avoid overstating demand. Use recent_N=3 for sigma_hat to reflect recent low-volatility behavior. These parameters keep target base-stock close to the observed low demand (reducing holding cost) while allowing the OR engine to compute a capped order to restore modest coverage.

Carry-over insight: Downward demand regime maintained: recent_N=3 mean\u224845 (Periods 31-33 demands 35,62,38); continue using recent_N=3 forecasting until contradicted.

Period 35 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/10/21 (Period 35). Recent downward demand regime persists: last 3 concluded demands (Periods 32-34) = [62,38,43], recent_3 mean=47.67 << earlier higher regimes. All concluded lead-times = 0 (orders historically arrived same period). On-hand=9, in-transit=0; expected demand this period \u224847.7 so on-hand is low and we should target the recent low-demand regime to avoid excess holding. Choose L = promised (0) given consistent concluded lead-times. Forecast using recent_N=3 to reflect the confirmed downward regime; mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_recent3 = 47.67. Volatility estimated from the same recent_N=3 sample: sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std_recent3 \u2248 12.66. These parameters bias orders toward the new lower-demand regime, reducing holding cost while keeping adequate service for the lower demand.

Period 36 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:

All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 historically, so use promised/default L=0. Inventory is low (on-hand=4, in-transit=0) so we forecast using recent_N=3 to reflect the new low-demand regime and avoid overstock. mu_hat set to (1+L)*recent_mean to target the (L+1)-period demand; sigma_hat set to sqrt(1+L)*std of recent 3 observations to reflect observed low volatility. This balances service (small order to cover next period) vs holding cost under the current low-demand regime.

Period 38 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:

All concluded lead-times have been 0 historically. On-hand=13, in-transit=0 so current inventory is below the (1+L)-period demand forecast. I therefore use promised lead time (L=0) and recent_N=3 forecasting to reflect the validated downward regime; this reduces target base-stock vs older high-season means and balances service (avoid stockouts given low recent mean) against holding cost by lowering mu_hat and using actual recent volatility for sigma_hat.

Period 39 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/18. Recent demand regime is the sustained downward regime documented in carry-over notes. Last 3 concluded demands (Periods 36-38 = 36,34,42) give a recent mean ~37.33 units and low volatility. All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 historically. Therefore set L=default (promised=0). Use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current low-demand regime so the OR engine reduces target inventory and holding cost exposure. On-hand=2, in-transit=0 \u2014 substantially below short-run demand (\u224837), so backend base-stock will generate an order but constrained by its cap.

Carry-over insight: Downward demand regime continued: recent_N=3 mean=37.33 (Periods 36-38 demands 36,34,42); continue recent_N=3 forecasting until contradicted.

All concluded orders historically have lead_time=0, so use promised lead time. On-hand=23 vs expected one-period demand ~31 so a small replenishment is appropriate. Choose L=default (promised=0).

Recent history shows a prior downward regime but Period 40 demand spiked to 113 (Periods 38-40 demands = 42, 17, 113). I treat this as the most relevant short-term signal but remain cautious (small N). Therefore I set L to the promised/default (0). I use recent_N=3 for mu_hat to capture the latest short-run demand level (mean=57.33) and recent_N=3 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility (sample std \u224849.81). These choices keep the OR base-stock responsive to the latest observed regime while avoiding overcommitment given the spike may be noisy.

Period 42 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09. On-hand=28, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments; historical concluded lead times all 0. Demand has been in a sustained low/downward regime recently. Use promised lead time (L=0). Forecast using recent_N=3 (Periods 39-41 demands = [17,113,51], recent mean=60.333) to capture the current low-demand regime. Set mu_hat = (1+L)*recent_mean = 60.333. Estimate volatility from the same window: sample std \u2248 48.670, sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std = 48.670. These parameters keep target base-stock low to avoid holding cost while matching current demand.

Carry-over insight: Downward demand regime maintained: recent_N=3 mean=60.33 (Periods 39-41 demands 17,113,51); use recent_N=3 forecasting until contradicted.

Period 43 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:

Recent demand regime remains the short-term (recent_N=3) signal: last 3 concluded demands (Periods 40-42) = [113,51,57], mean=73.67, std\u224827.93. On-hand=25, pipeline=0 so we need an order that reflects (1+L)-period demand forecast with modest uncertainty. I set L=0 (default/promised), mu_hat via recent_N=3 to capture the current low-demand regime, and sigma_hat via recent_N=3 to inform safety stock; this balances service (capture recent spikes like 113) versus holding cost by avoiding full-sample inflation.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (Period 44). Recent demand shows a sustained low/downward regime: last 3 concluded demands (Periods 41-43) = [51,57,58], recent 3-mean=55.33. On-hand=31, in-transit=0 so pipeline is empty; avoid large replenishment. Use promised lead time (default L=0). Forecast (mu_hat) set using recent_N=3 to capture the new low regime: (1+L)*mean_last3 = 55.33. Volatility (sigma_hat) set using recent_N=3 sample std: std_last3 \u2248 3.787. These parameters keep target base-stock low to limit holding cost while meeting the current depressed demand and preserve service given near-zero lead time.

Carry-over insight: Maintain downward demand regime: recent_N=3 mean=55.33 (Periods 41-43 demands 51,57,58); use recent_N=3 forecasting until contradicted.

Period 45 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times = 0 (all arrives same period) so use promised/default L=0. Recent demand regime is the downward regime (stable last 3 demands 57,58,57 \u2192 mean 57.33); use recent_N=3 to capture current low demand and limit holding. sigma_hat estimated from last 3 samples (std \u2248 0.47). These parameters reduce inventory risk while providing service for the current low-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Downward demand regime maintained: recent_N=3 mean=57.33 (Periods 42-44 demands = 57,58,57); continue recent_N=3 forecasting until contradicted.
