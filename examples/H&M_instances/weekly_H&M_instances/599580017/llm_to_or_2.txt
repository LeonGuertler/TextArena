Period 1 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25: swimwear SKU entering spring season; recent historical demands show an upward trend (last three samples 152,129,213 with spike to 213). No concluded arrivals observed, so trust promised lead time. To respond to rising demand while controlling holding cost, keep promised L and use an EWMA for mu_hat (gamma=0.5) to weight recent higher draws; keep sigma_hat default to reflect full-sample variability.

Carry-over insight: Recent demand increase: last 3 samples mean=164.7 vs earlier samples mean=79.5; treat as potential regime shift until further data confirm.

Period 2 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/4. Historical demands = [61,98,152,129,213]; recent 3-sample mean = 164.7 vs earlier mean = 79.5, indicating a likely upward regime in demand. On-hand=0, in-transit=266 (pipeline provides buffer but arrival not yet concluded). No concluded arrivals exist to revise lead-time. I therefore keep L at promised (default) and target demand over review+lead using the recent regime: set mu_hat using recent_N with N=3 to reflect higher recent demand, and set sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to capture increased volatility. These choices raise the base stock to meet the apparent new demand level while sigma update increases safety stock for service; keeping L=default avoids over-reacting without concluded lead-time evidence.

Period 3 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019-03-11). On-hand=0, in-transit=508 (orders from P1/P2) with no concluded arrivals \u2192 shipments delayed or lost beyond promised L=4. Demand samples show recent uptick (last 3 mean high). To be conservative against stockouts, extend lead time estimate and size forecast from recent regime. Choices: L explicit=6 to reflect likely prolonged arrival window; mu_hat recent_N (N=3) to base (1+L)-period demand on the recent higher-demand regime; sigma_hat recent_N (N=3) to capture current volatility in last 3 samples. This increases target base-stock to prioritize service level given lost/delayed arrivals while acknowledging higher holding cost.

Period 4 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-03-18 (Period 4). On-hand=0, in-transit=733 (orders placed in Periods 1-3 not yet concluded). No concluded arrivals yet, so no evidence actual lead time differs from promised 4; use default promised L. Recent demand regime elevated: last 3 observed demands (Periods 1-3 concludes: 175,173,181) average ~176 \u2014 treat forecast on recent 3-sample regime. Therefore set mu_hat from recent_N (N=3) to capture higher demand over the review+lead horizon. Use sigma_hat recent_N (N=3) to reflect current volatility in the same recent regime. These choices raise target base stock to cover the apparent demand uptick while relying on promised lead time until we observe concluded arrivals or losses.

Period 5 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-25). Recent demand has risen vs earlier history (recent 3-period mean >> earlier mean). On-hand=0, in-transit=886 \u2014 pipeline is large but arrivals not yet concluded; no concluded arrivals observed so promised L=4 remains credible. To capture the apparent regime shift I use recent_N for demand (last 3 samples) so \u03bc\u0302 reflects higher short-term demand across the (1+L) review+lead horizon; use recent_N for \u03c3\u0302 to reflect recent volatility. Keeping L=default (promised) avoids prematurely assuming lost/extended lead times while the large in-transit volume provides coverage. This balances service (higher base stock to meet elevated demand) against holding cost by using short-window estimates rather than full-sample averages.

Daily Reward (R_t): $532.00

Period 6 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. History shows one concluded arrival: Period 5 reported arrived=266 (ordered Period 1) with lead_time=4, confirming actual lead time \u2248 promised 4. Demand has remained elevated for five observed periods (175,173,181,200,268) supporting the earlier detected regime shift to higher demand. Use lead-time averaged from observed conclusions to reflect confirmed lead time; use recent demand (last 5 periods) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained increase and recent volatility. This counters prior lost-arrival uncertainty by trusting the observed 4-period lead time and sizing the replenishment to cover (1+L) periods of the new demand level, improving service while limiting holding cost accumulation.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand increase confirmed: last 5 periods mean=199.4 (175,173,181,200,268) vs earlier baseline; treat as new regime until contradicted.

Period 7 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08 (Period 7). On-hand=0, in-transit=694 (orders from Periods 3\u20136: 225+153+51+265). Observed concluded lead-times = 4,4 \u2192 use calculated average L=4. Demand shows a sustained upward regime (recent periods 1\u20135: 175,173,181,200,268 and Period 6 spike 376); to capture the new regime, set demand forecast using the most recent 5 samples (regime_length=5). Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=5) so the OR engine targets service for the higher recent mean while reflecting recent volatility. This balances higher fill-rate (profit=$2 vs holding=$1) with holding cost by sizing base stock to recent elevated demand and variance.

Period 8 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-15). Recent periods show a sustained demand regime shift to higher levels (recent 5-period mean \u2248199.4). On-hand=0, in-transit=849 (pipeline large but some arrivals recently confirming lead_time=4). Concluded arrivals show orders placed on Periods 1\u20133 arrived with W=4 \u2192 actual lead time =4. Set L by 'calculate' to lock in observed lead time average. For demand, use recent_N with N=5 to capture the new high-demand regime ((1+L)-period demand forecast anchored on last 5 samples). Use sigma recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters ensure the OR backend targets a base stock sized for the new regime and the 1+L coverage, reducing stockouts while limiting excess holding given high in-transit inventory.

Period 9 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/22 (Period 9). On-hand=0, in-transit=1089. Observed concluded lead times = 4 periods for all arrivals \u2192 no evidence to change promised L. Recent demand has shifted materially upward: last 5 concluded demands = (200,268,376,295,367) mean\u2248301.2, much higher than earlier periods. Pipeline (1089) covers ~3.6 of the current ~301/day mean, short of the (1+L)=5 period coverage target \u2192 OR should raise target inventory to match the new regime. Therefore: keep L at default (promised=4), set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture the confirmed high-demand regime and recent volatility so the backend's base-stock and cap reflect current demand.

Recent demand exhibits a sustained upward regime (Periods 5\u20139 mean=199.4); to capture current demand level and volatility I use recent_N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine sizes base-stock and caps to the new regime and avoids understocking while acknowledging higher variance. This also accounts for large in-transit pipeline and prevents over-ordering given holding cost.

On-hand=0, in-transit=1597 \u2014 substantial pipeline but demand per period in last 5 periods is ~396.6. Observed concluded lead times = 4 consistently, so use promised lead time. Set L=default to match promised lead time; use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the confirmed high-demand regime (N=5 = length of recent regime), so the OR engine targets supply for the new demand level while respecting holding cost and the capped order policy.

Period 12 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/13. Historical concludes show consistent 4-period arrivals (no evidence of lead-time drift) and a sustained demand increase over recent periods (last 5-period mean \u2248199.4 vs earlier baseline). On-hand=48, in-transit=1677 \u2014 large pipeline already covers multiple periods. Set L=default (promised 4). For demand forecast use recent_N N=5 to capture the new higher-demand regime; apply same recent_N N=5 for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep safety stock aligned with the confirmed uplift while avoiding over-forecasting from older low-demand samples.

Period 13 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-20). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime (Periods 5-11: recent 5-period mean ~199.4 vs earlier baseline). Observed lead times from concluded messages are consistently 4 periods (no evidence of delays/lost shipments). Current inventory position: on-hand=24, in-transit=1577 \u2192 ample pipeline but continued high demand requires higher base stock. I set L=default to trust the promised lead time (consistent with observed 4-period arrivals). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture the confirmed higher-demand regime (uses last 5 demand samples to scale (1+L) mean and sqrt(1+L) std) so the OR backend raises the target base-stock and accounts for increased variability while avoiding overreacting to older low-demand data.

Period 14 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27. Recent concluded demand shows a sustained higher regime (periods 9-13 demands = 477,468,332,417,370). Observed concluded lead times are consistently 4 periods. On-hand=76 with large pipeline=1671; pipeline appears healthy but demand is elevated so we size review+lead forecast to the recent regime. Therefore: set L=calculate (average observed lead time = 4), set mu_hat using recent_N N=5 to capture the elevated mean demand over the last 5 periods, and set sigma_hat using recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices align ordering to the current high-demand regime while recognizing arrivals in-transit.

Period 15 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-06-03). Recent history shows consistently observed lead_time = 4 (orders concluded from Period 5 onward all report lead_time=4). On-hand=0, in-transit=1647 (large pipeline arriving over coming periods). Demand has shifted to a higher regime; last 5 realized demands (Periods 10-14) = [468, 332, 417, 370, 525], mean=422.4 and elevated volatility. Set L by calculating observed lead times to match reality. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the confirmed new demand regime (keeps forecast responsive to high recent demand while letting OR backend compute base stock and caps). This balances higher service level needed for elevated demand against holding cost given large in-transit inventory.

Carry-over insight: Sustained higher demand regime confirmed: last 5 periods mean=422.4 (periods 10-14 demands 468,332,417,370,525) vs earlier baseline; treat as new regime until contradicted.

Demand has shifted to a higher regime: recent 5-period demands (Periods 11-15 = 332,417,370,525,330) average \u2248394.8, well above earlier baseline. On-hand=130 and large in-transit=1726 (covers many future periods), so avoid inflating demand forecast beyond recent regime. Set L to default (promised 4). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the (1+L)-period forecast and volatility on the confirmed higher-demand regime while letting the OR engine cap orders given the large pipeline.

Period 18 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-24). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime (Periods 10-17 with large weekly demand); actual lead times observed in concluded messages are consistently 4 periods. Current inventory: on-hand=120, in-transit=1392 \u2014 pipeline is large relative to demand, so avoid inflating orders. Use promised lead time (default) since concluded lead-times =4 confirm promise. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples (captures the confirmed higher-demand regime while letting backend compute safety stock given profit/holding tradeoff). This prevents over-ordering despite large pipeline and leverages backend caps to limit week-to-week order sizes.

Period 19 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-07-01). Recent demand is clearly in a higher regime: last 5 demands (Periods 14-18) = [525,330,302,517,771], mean\u2248489. Promised lead time has consistently been 4 periods in concluded history (all observed arrivals show lead_time=4), so use default L to match supplier promise. To target the current elevated demand while limiting holding cost, set mu_hat based on the most recent 5 samples (captures new regime). Use sigma_hat based on the same recent 5 to reflect current volatility. This gives the OR engine a short, focused window on the higher-demand regime while retaining the promised lead time assumption; in-transit stock (1096) plus aggressive recent-based base stock should cover near-term demand without excessive extra safety stock.

Period 20 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-07-08). On-hand=0, in-transit=1356. Historical concluded lead times = 4 periods consistently. Recent demand has been in a higher regime (last 5 demands = 330,302,517,771,592; mean=502.4). To match the elevated demand and keep service while avoiding excessive holding, use promised lead time and recent-5 demand estimates for forecast and volatility. L set to default (promised=4) because concluded lead times are stable at 4. mu_hat recent_N N=5 to capture the new high-demand regime across the review+lead window. sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. This configuration ensures the OR backend targets a base stock sized to recent demand spikes while the cap will limit extreme over-ordering given current large in-transit volume.

Period 21 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:

All concluded arrivals show lead_time=4 historically. I keep L=default (promised=4). To protect service given sustained high demand, set mu_hat via recent_N using last 5 periods (captures new regime). Use sigma_hat recent_N (last 5) to reflect recent volatility. This raises target base-stock to meet high demand while pipeline (1982) partially covers expected demand but not fully for L+1=5 periods, so higher mu_hat helps avoid stockouts.

Period 22 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-22): on-hand=0, in-transit=2525. Lead times have consistently been 4 periods in concluded history. Recent demand has jumped sharply: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 17-21) = [517,771,592,542,510], mean=586.4 indicating a new high-demand regime. To capture this shift I keep L=default (promised 4) and use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine sizes base stock and cap to the elevated demand and volatility while avoiding dilution by older low-demand data. This addresses potential stockouts while the large in-transit (2525) will be reconciled by the backend when arrivals conclude.

Carry-over insight: Period 22: Sustained very high demand regime confirmed: last 5 periods mean=586.4 (periods 17-21 demands 517,771,592,542,510); treat as new regime until contradicted.

Period 23 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019-07-29). Concluded history shows actual lead times consistently = 4 periods (orders from Periods 1-18 arrived with W=4), so use promised/default lead time. Recent demand has moved to a sustained very-high regime (last 5 demands: 771,592,542,510,710; mean=625). In-transit=2955 provides large coverage but may include arrivals from multiple outstanding orders; to protect service during this high-demand regime set mu_hat based on the last 5 periods (recent_N N=5) so the OR engine targets (1+L)\xd7recent mean. Use sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to capture current volatility. These choices prioritize avoiding stockouts in the new high-demand regime while capping orders via the backend cap to limit excess holding costs.

Period 24 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/05 (Period 24). Recent demand regime is high: last 5 realized demands (Periods 19-23) = [592,542,510,710,309], mean=532.6 \u2014 use a recent-window forecast to capture this regime. Lead-times in concluded history consistently 4 periods (no evidence of loss), so use promised/default L=4. On-hand=490 and in-transit=2434 \u2014 pipeline is large and should cover (1+L) periods of demand, but using recent demand for mu_hat prevents underordering if high demand persists. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to match the observed high-volatility, high-mean regime.

Period 25 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-08-12). On-hand=1136, in-transit=1612. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 4 periods (no evidence of drift or lost shipments), so use promised lead time. Recent demand is elevated and variable; last 5 realized demands (Periods 20-24) = [542,510,710,309,176], indicating a higher mean and elevated volatility versus earlier baseline. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the current high-demand regime and higher variance so the OR backend raises base-stock while controlling holding cost. This balances service level (avoid stockouts given strong recent demand) against holding cost given substantial on-hand inventory.

Period 26 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-19). Recent concluded history shows consistent actual lead_time = 4 (orders placed earlier all arrived with lead_time=4). On-hand = 1826 and in-transit = 790 \u2014 ample coverage versus near-term demand; risk is holding cost. I therefore keep L as default (use promised lead time = 4) and let the OR engine compute mu_hat and sigma_hat from all samples (default), which produces conservative replenishment tuned to full historical demand and the promised lead time. This avoids adding inventory while on-hand+pipeline is already high and leverages the backend capped ordering policy to limit order sizes given high current stock.

Period 27 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019/8/26). On-hand=2183, in-transit=278 (pipeline total visible=2461). Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods \u2192 use promised/default L. Recent demand has come down over last 5 concluded periods (Periods 22-26 demands = 710,309,176,132,155; recent 5-mean \u2248296) and current on-hand is very high, so use recent_N for mu_hat to anchor the (1+L) forecast to recent demand and avoid over-ordering. Use default sigma_hat so backend scales volatility by sqrt(1+L). These choices reduce ordering pressure given large on-hand while still covering recent demand pattern and maintaining service-level tradeoff.

Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4 across many periods (no lost shipments); recent demand has been elevated historically but no new changepoint in last period. Given large on-hand and stable observed LT=4, use defaults so OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample set; this lets the optimizer balance service vs holding costs without overreacting to single-period noise.

Recent demand has fallen sharply over the last 5 periods (periods 26-30 demands = 155,139,78,65,30), indicating a downward short-term regime (end of season). With very high on-hand and no in-transit, prioritize reducing future receipts to limit holding cost.

Date 2019/10/7 (Period 33). On-hand=2052, in-transit=0; large inventory cushion after multiple arrivals through Period 27 and then no arrivals since (Periods 28-32 arrived=0) \u2014 potential lost/paused shipments but current stock is ample. Recent visible demand has dropped sharply: last 5 demands (Periods 28-32) = [78,65,30,35,62], mean \u2248 54; use a short recent-window forecast to avoid over-ordering. Promised lead time remains 4 and historical concluded lead times where arrivals occurred were consistently 4, so keep L=default. Set mu_hat using recent_N to scale (1+L)\xd7recent mean so the OR engine targets throughput matching the current low-demand regime. Use sigma_hat recent_N to capture reduced recent volatility.

Period 34 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-10-14). On-hand=2014, in-transit=0 \u2014 no incoming arrivals scheduled. Historical concludes show consistent 4-period lead time when shipments occurred, but no recent orders arrived because ordering stopped; treat promised L=4 as default. Recent demand has collapsed vs summer: last 5 demands (Periods 29-33) = [65,30,35,62,38], mean \u224846. Use a recent_N forecast to reflect the current low-demand regime and reduce stocking/holding cost. Use recent_N for sigma to reflect recent low volatility. This keeps base stock low to avoid holding cost while matching current demand pattern.

Carry-over insight: New sustained low-demand regime confirmed: Periods 29-33 mean=46.0 (65,30,35,62,38); treat as current regime until contradicted.

Period 36 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-28). Recent history shows a sustained low-demand regime (Periods 29-35 demands = 65,30,35,62,38,43,50; mean ~46). On-hand = 1921, in-transit = 0 \u2192 inventory far exceeds expected demand (covers many weeks), no urgent replenishment needed and prior shipments have ceased. Use promised lead time (default L=4). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=7 to reflect the confirmed low-demand regime (use last 7 samples), avoiding over-ordering while letting backend compute the (1+L) scaled mean and volatility. This keeps service while minimizing holding costs given large on-hand stock and no pipeline.

Period 37 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-11-04). Recent demand regime: sustained low demand since Period 29\u201336 (recent 5-period mean \u224846 units). On-hand = 1885, in-transit = 0 \u2014 ample cover for many weeks at current demand; no arrivals observed recently but supplier lead-time historically = 4 (no current concluded late shipments). To avoid excess holding cost while maintaining service, keep promised lead time and forecast using the recent low-demand regime. Set L = default (use promised 4). Set mu_hat to recent_N with N=5 to reflect the current low-demand regime (covers review+lead demand). Set sigma_hat to recent_N with N=5 to reflect reduced volatility in the recent regime.

Period 38 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 38). Recent demand has settled into the low-demand regime identified earlier (periods 29-37 average ~40 units/week). On-hand is very high (1851) and in-transit=0, so we should size replenishment to the low recent demand to avoid holding cost. Use promised lead time (observed lead times have been consistently 4). Use recent_N=5 for demand and volatility to capture the most recent low-demand regime (periods ~33-37). This yields a conservative replenishment target ((1+L)\xd7recent mean) that reduces excess inventory while maintaining service for short lead time.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-18). On-hand=1809, in-transit=0. Recent history (Periods 29-38) shows a sustained low-demand regime (demands ~30-78, mean \u224846) confirmed in prior carry-over. To avoid overstock erosion while maintaining service, keep promised lead time (default L=4) and forecast using the recent low-demand regime. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the last 10 periods (regime_length=10) so the OR backend targets stocking appropriate to the low-demand regime and reduces future holding cost risk.

Period 40 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-25). On-hand=1792, in-transit=0. Recent concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=4 historically (no evidence of lost shipments), so keep L as promised. Demand has settled into the low-demand regime identified earlier (Period 29-39: demands = 78,65,30,35,62,38,43,50,36,34,42,17; regime length=11). To reflect the current low regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the last 11 samples (N=11). This biases the backend forecast toward the low recent mean/variance, avoiding excessive future receipts given large on-hand stock and high holding cost.

Period 41 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-12-02). Recent periods show a sustained low-demand regime (Periods 29-40 average \u224848 units/week, last 5 \u224848.4) and on-hand=1679, in-transit=0 with supplier shipments paused after Period 26. Given large on-hand and current low demand, keep promised lead time (no evidence to shorten) but use a recent-window demand estimate to avoid excess ordering. I set L=default (use promised 4). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the new low-demand regime and lower volatility so the OR backend reduces target base-stock and strict cap, preventing overstock while preserving service. This also guards against assuming lost shipments \u2014 no new in-transit observed so do not increase L.

Period 42 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019/12/9). On-hand=1628, in-transit=0. Recent history (Periods 29\u201341) shows a sustained low-demand regime (mean \u224846 over Periods 29\u201333 and continued low weekly sales thereafter, with occasional spikes at Periods 40). No inbound shipments scheduled (no overdue arrivals visible). Use promised lead time (default L=4) since concluded arrivals historically show lead_time=4 and there is no new conclude evidence of drift. For demand, target the current low-demand regime using recent_N over the full recent regime (13 most recent demand observations, Periods 29\u201341) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the lower mean/volatility and avoid overstocking given holding cost >0. This balances service level and holding cost by shrinking the (1+L)-period demand forecast and tightening the safety stock around recent variability.

Period 43 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16 (Period 43). Recent history (Periods 29\u201342) shows a sustained low-demand regime (demands mostly 30\u2013113, recent average ~50s). On-hand=1571, in-transit=0 \u2014 inventory is ample relative to current low demand. Use promised lead time (default) since concluded arrivals consistently showed lead_time=4 in history and there are no recent lost-shipment signals. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the detected low-demand regime to reflect the new lower mean/volatility (N=14 covers Periods 29\u201342). This keeps the OR backend\u2019s base-stock small relative to demand variance while avoiding unnecessary replenishment given large on-hand stock, balancing service vs holding cost.

Period 44 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/23 (Period 44). Sales have settled into the low-demand regime identified at Period 34 (recent 5-period mean ~59 units/week). All concluded lead-time observations show consistent 4-period arrivals historically; no recent arrivals to contradict promised lead time. To avoid overstocking given large on-hand (1513) and holding cost = $1/unit, I keep L at the promised/default and calibrate demand using the most recent 5 weeks to reflect the low regime. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets service for current low-volatility demand while avoiding additional inventory build-up.
