Period 1 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019-02-25). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no concluded arrivals observed. Use promised lead time since no evidence to override. Historical demand mean = 130.6 (samples [61,98,152,129,213]); with L=2 the review+lead multiplier is (1+L)=3. Use default estimators so backend computes mu_hat=(1+L)*mean and sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std. This balances service level (covers ~3 periods of demand) against holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Period 2 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 (2019-03-04). On-hand=0, in-transit=225 (ordered Period 1 arrived=0 in Period 1 conclude). Promised lead time=2; no concluded arrivals yet so do not infer lead-time change. Demand history shows mean ~130.6 (samples [61,98,152,129,213]) and recent Period 1 demand=175; given limited evidence of a regime shift use default aggregate estimates to let the OR backend compute (1+L)-scaled forecast and volatility. This also keeps pipeline coverage for the review+lead horizon while avoiding overreacting to one high recent demand.

Period 3 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/11. Recent demand history shows moderate-high demand (samples [61,98,152,129,213]); on-hand=52, in-transit=228 (Period2 ordered=228 still inbound). Period2 conclude reports arrival from Period1 with lead_time=1. No evidence of lost shipments. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses observed lead times (captures actual shorter lead time=1). I leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as 'default' so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all samples \u2014 appropriate given no detected demand regime change and limited history. This balances service level (using shorter inferred L reduces required pipeline) against holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Observed actual lead time = 1 period (Period2 conclude: ordered on Period1, lead_time was 1); no lost shipments detected.

Period 4 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (2019-03-18). On-hand=0, in-transit=266. Historical demands [61,98,152,129,213] (mean=130.6). Concluded evidence: Period 2 conclude shows an order placed in Period 1 arrived with lead_time=1, indicating actual lead time recently =1 (no lost shipments observed). I set L to 'calculate' to use the average of observed lead times (captures the recent observed shift from promised L=2 to actual L=1). For demand parameters, I use 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples given the inferred L; this balances service level against holding cost while relying on full sample history given limited datapoints and no clear demand regime change. This approach accounts for the recent shorter lead time and the current pipeline (266) when the OR engine computes orders.

Period 5 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/25 (Period 5). Recent on-hand=0, in-transit=326. Historical demand samples show an upward shift: demands in recent conclude messages = 173 (P2), 181 (P3), 200 (P4). Observed actual lead time evidence: Period 2 conclude recorded an arrival with lead_time=1. I use lead-time inference via calculate (average of observed lead times -> 1). To capture the recent demand uptick, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 (uses the three most recent demand samples) so the backend base_stock reflects higher short-term demand while sigma captures recent volatility. This keeps orders responsive to rising demand while limiting excess holding costs given current large in-transit volume (326 units) and observed shorter lead time.

Carry-over insight: Recent demand regime shift upward: recent demands 173,181,200 (Periods 2-4) indicate higher mean demand; treat as new regime.

Period 6 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/1 (Period 6). Recent realized demands show an upward regime (Periods 2-4 demands 173,181,200) and a volatile late spike (Period 5 demand 268). On-hand=0, in-transit=150 (some prior orders still en route; recent concludes show mixed lead times: observed 1 and 3 periods => variability). I set L=calculate to let backend average observed lead times (captures the 1 and 3 period observations). For demand I use recent_N (N=3) based on the detected new regime (173,181,200) so mu_hat reflects the higher recent mean across the review+lead period. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N (N=3) to capture recent volatility. These choices bias ordering toward the higher recent demand while letting the backend compute buffer using observed lead-time variability; keeping parameters recent-focused helps avoid understock given the clear upward shift and mixed deliveries.

Period 7 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-04-08. On-hand=0, in-transit=344; recent concluded arrivals show observed lead times = {1,3,3,2} (avg\u22482.25) and demand has shifted sharply up in recent periods (demands recent: 175,173,181,200,268,376). To capture realized lead-time variability I use calculate (avg observed). For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=5) to anchor to the new higher-demand regime and prevent underordering. For volatility I use recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent demand dispersion. These choices raise the base stock to improve service while letting the OR backend cap orders to control holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Period 8 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-15). Recent demand has jumped since Period 5 (demands 268,376,295), indicating a new high-demand regime; on-hand=0, in-transit=531. Observed concluded lead times = {1,3,3,2} \u2192 use calculated average lead time to reflect variability and delays. For demand forecast use recent regime (most recent 3 periods) so mu_hat captures the higher mean; use recent_N for sigma_hat over same 3 samples to capture elevated volatility. These params increase target base-stock to reduce stockouts while acknowledging higher holding cost via sigma estimate.

Period 9 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-22). Recent demand has risen sharply and persistently (recent demands: 181,200,268,376,295,367), so I use a recent-window estimate to capture the new high-demand regime. Observed concluded lead times = {1,3,3,2} \u2192 average ~2.25; use calculated average lead time. Using recent_N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat biases the backend forecast toward the current higher mean and volatility, helping raise base-stock while keeping variability accounted for. On-hand=0, in-transit=661 (pipeline large) \u2014 higher mu_hat guards against further stockouts if some in-transit shipments are lost or delayed.

Period 10 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29. Recent demand has accelerated sharply since Period 5; last 5 period demands = [268,376,295,367,477] (very high variance). On-hand=0, in-transit=239 (some shipments delayed historically). Observed concluded lead times = [1,3,3,2,3,1] \u2192 average > promised; use calculated average lead time to capture prolonged/variable lead times. For demand forecasting I use a recent_N (N=5) estimate to capture the new high-demand regime beginning Period 5; same recent window for sigma to reflect elevated variability. These settings increase target base-stock to improve fill rates given long/variable lead times while letting the OR backend cap orders to limit holding cost exposure.

Carry-over insight: Sustained upward demand regime starting Period 5; evidence: Periods 5-9 demands = [268,376,295,367,477], recent mean >> earlier periods; treat as new baseline.

Period 11 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-05-06). On-hand=0, in-transit=543. Historical concluded lead-times vary but recent concludes (Periods 6-10) show predominantly 3-period arrivals (e.g. orders placed in P6,P7 arriving after 3 periods); evidence of longer-than-promised delays. Demand has a sustained upward regime starting Period 5 (Periods 5-9 demands = [268,376,295,367,477]). To match the recent delivery behavior and elevated demand baseline, set L using recent lead-time observations and set mu_hat/sigma_hat from the recent high-demand regime. Methods chosen: L -> recent_N N=5 to capture current slower deliveries; mu_hat -> recent_N N=5 and sigma_hat -> recent_N N=5 to base forecast and volatility on the five most recent high-demand samples, improving service while controlling holding cost given profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 12 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019/5/13). Recent history shows a sustained upward demand regime starting Period 5 (high demands P5-P11) and observed concluded lead times clustered around 3 with some 1-2 values. On-hand=0, in-transit=840 (covers some upcoming demand but arrivals are subject to variable lead times and occasional 3-period delays). I set L using recent_N to capture the current (slower) realized lead-time regime. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the post-changepoint regime (Periods 5+) so the backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand using the elevated recent mean and volatility; this raises base-stock to improve service given high demand, while sigma_hat recent_N captures current variability for safety stock.

Period 13 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20 Period13. Recent history shows a sustained upward demand regime starting Period5 (Periods5-12 demands high vs earlier) and frequent concluded lead_times often =3 in recent arrivals. To capture longer/more variable actual lead time use recent_N for L to weight recent observed lead_times. For demand forecast use recent_N over the new regime (Periods5-12, 8 samples) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the higher baseline and volatility. This raises base_stock to avoid stockouts given overdue/lost-arrival risk while sigma_hat recent_N captures increased variability.

LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-27). On-hand=0, in-transit=840. Observed concluded lead times = [1,3,3,2,3,1,3] (recent trend skewed to 3). Demand regime shifted up starting Period 5 (sustained higher demands through Periods 5-13). To capture increased recent lead-time, set L by averaging the last 5 observed lead times (recent_N, N=5). To capture the sustained higher demand baseline, compute mu_hat and sigma_hat from the recent demand regime (Periods 5-13) using recent_N with N=9. These settings bias the OR base-stock toward higher safety stock to protect service amid longer recent lead-times and elevated demand while the large in-transit position is accounted for by the backend pipeline subtraction.

Period 15 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-06-03). On-hand=0, in-transit=543. Historical concluded lead times show recent frequent 3-period arrivals (Periods 5,6,9,10,14) after an earlier 1-2 mix \u2192 shift toward L=3. Demand has a sustained upward regime starting Period 5 (Periods 5-14 demands much higher than initial sample). I set L via recent_N to capture the recent lead-time regime. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat via recent_N with N equal to the regime length (10 periods, Periods 5-14) to anchor the base-stock to the new higher-demand baseline and recent volatility. This increases target inventory to avoid stockouts given prolonged lead times while the OR backend will cap orders; in-transit 543 helps cover several upcoming periods but the higher mu_hat ensures replenishment continues to meet elevated demand.

Concluded arrivals show mixed but predominantly long lead times (observed W values = [1,3,3,2,3,1,3,3], avg=2.375), and demand has sustained an upward regime starting Period 5. Set L via calculate to reflect observed average lead time. Use recent_N (N=11) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (review+lead) demand forecast and volatility on the sustained higher-demand regime (Periods 5-15), reducing stockout risk while keeping holding cost in mind.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-17 P17. On-hand=0, in-transit=830; profit=2, holding=1. Historical concl: observed lead times = [1,3,3,2,3,1,3,3] with majority=3 \u2192 recent average longer than promised=2. Demand regime shifted up starting Period5 and has been sustained (Periods5-16 demands \u2248 [268,376,295,367,477,468,332,417,370,525,330,302], n=12). Decisions: set L via recent_N to capture the recent realized lead-time distribution (use last 5 observed lead times to balance older 1s vs many 3s). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat via recent_N using the 12-sample recent high-demand regime so the OR engine targets a higher base-stock and reflects elevated volatility. This increases order targets to avoid stockouts given prolonged/variable lead times and sustained higher demand while letting the backend cap limit excessive orders.

On-hand=0, in-transit=830 (large pipeline). I set L to recent_N to capture the observed shift toward longer lead times (use last 5 observed lead-time samples to smooth occasional 1s). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N with N=5 to anchor forecasts/volatility to the recent high-demand regime (last 5 demand observations), letting the OR backend compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std. This balances service (higher recent demand) against holding cost given the already-large in-transit pipeline.

LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-07-01). On-hand=0, in-transit=595. Recent conclude messages show multiple lead_time=3 arrivals in recent periods (Periods 5,6,9,10,14,18) with occasional 1\u20132; recent median behavior is ~3 \u2192 use recent_N to capture current slower/variable supply. Demand has shifted up materially since Period 5 with very high recent demands (Periods 14\u201318 = 525,330,302,517,771); use recent_N=5 to set mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets service for the new high-demand, high-volatility regime while the L estimate increases pipeline coverage to reduce stockouts given observed delayed arrivals.

Period 20 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-08 (Period 20). On-hand=0, in-transit=1093. Recent concluded arrivals show majority lead_time=3 in recent periods (Periods 5,6,9,10,14,18) with occasional 1\u20132; recent trend favors longer lead time. Demand has been in a sustained higher regime since Period 5. To reflect persistent longer lead-time behavior use recent_N for L to bias toward recent observations. For demand forecast use recent_N over the post-change regime (Period 5 onward) to capture the higher baseline; keep sigma conservative (default) using all samples. These settings aim to raise base-stock to cover (L+1) periods of elevated demand while letting OR cap limit extreme orders.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time has moved to ~3 periods (evidence: arrived lead_time=3 in Periods 5,6,9,10,14,18); sustained upward demand regime starting Period 5 (Periods 5-19 mean >> Periods 1-4).

Period 21 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-15). Recent history shows sustained high demand since Period 5 (many periods with large demands) and concluded arrivals repeatedly indicate actual lead time \u2248 3 periods. On-hand=0, in-transit=1093 units (pipeline exists but lead time has been 3 historically). Set L explicitly to 3 to match observed concluded lead times and avoid under-ordering. Forecast demand using the sustained high-regime mean (Periods 5\u201320 mean demand \u2248 434.31); with L=3 the review+lead horizon is 4 periods so mu_hat set explicit to 4\xd7434.3125 = 1737.25 to cover expected demand over the horizon. Use default sigma_hat so backend computes volatility from full samples scaled by sqrt(1+L). These choices align supply pipeline with observed 3-period lead times and raise target base stock to meet the sustained higher demand while letting the OR engine compute service-level buffer from computed sigma.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time shifted to \u22483 periods (evidence: multiple concluded arrivals with lead_time=3 in Periods 5,6,9,10,14,18); sustained upward demand regime starting Period 5 (Periods 5\u201320 mean demand \u2248 434.31) \u2014 treat as new baseline.

Period 22 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/22 (Period 22). Recent history shows sustained higher demand regime starting Period 5 (many periods with very large demands; recent mean \u2248434 units) and multiple concluded arrivals indicating actual lead times around 2\u20133 periods (observed lead-times average \u22482.4). On-hand=0, in-transit=1319 \u2014 pipeline is sizeable but shipments have shown variable delays. I set L to 'calculate' to let backend use the average of observed lead times (~2.4) reflecting recent 2\u20133 period deliveries. For demand I use recent_N with N=17 (regime from Period 5\u219221, 17 samples) so mu_hat captures the sustained upward baseline over the new regime. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N N=17 to capture recent volatility. These choices bias orders toward meeting the much higher recent demand while accounting for the longer, variable lead time and avoiding understocking given the high profit-to-holding ratio.

Carry-over insight: Sustained upward demand regime starting Period 5 (Periods 5\u201321 mean demand \u2248434); actual lead time has been variable but averages \u22482.4 periods (multiple concluded arrivals with W=3 and some W=2).

Period 23 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/29 (Period 23). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime starting Period 5 (Periods 5\u201321 mean \u2248434) and actual lead times observed = [1,3,3,2,3,1,3,3,3,2] \u2192 avg = 2.4. On-hand=0, in-transit=1319 (covering part of elevated demand). To account for variable/lengthened lead times use computed average lead time; set mu_hat to explicit forecast for the review+lead period using the new baseline mean (1+L)*434 \u22481475.6; set sigma_hat to an explicit volatility estimate ~277 to reflect high demand variability and protect service level while avoiding excessive holding given $1 holding cost and $2 profit.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time average \u22482.4 periods (observed lead_times: 1,3,3,2,3,1,3,3,3,2); sustained upward demand regime starting Period 5 with mean \u2248434 (Periods 5\u201321).

Period 24 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-08-05): on-hand=0, in-transit=1595. History shows a sustained upward demand regime starting Period 5 (large demands P5\u2013P23) and variable actual lead times (multiple concluded arrivals with W=1\u20133; average ~2.4\u20133). To capture the sustained higher-demand regime I use recent_N for demand estimates over the regime (length 19 periods: P5\u2013P23). For lead time I let the backend compute the average observed lead time from concluded arrivals (calculate) so ordering reflects realized variability and potential multi-period arrival lags. Sigma is estimated from recent regime data to reflect elevated volatility. These choices push the base-stock toward the new higher baseline while letting the OR engine cap orders to limit exposure given uncertain arrivals and the sizable in-transit pipeline.

Period 25 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 Period25. Recent history shows a sustained, higher-demand regime beginning Period5 (large demands through Period24) and multiple concluded arrivals with lead_times mostly =3 (with some 2s/1s). On-hand=548, in-transit=871 provides coverage but actual arrivals have trended later than promised. I set L explicit=3 to be conservative against late arrivals and avoid stockouts. For demand I use recent_N with N=20 to anchor mu_hat to the sustained high-demand regime (captures Period5\u201324 behavior). For sigma_hat I use recent_N N=20 to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise the base-stock to meet higher recent demand while acknowledging elevated lead time risk.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time shifted to ~3 periods (multiple concluded arrivals with W=3 across recent periods); sustained upward demand regime starting Period5 (Periods 5\u201324 mean demand substantially higher than Periods1\u20134).

Period 26 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-19). On-hand=416, in-transit=1313. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time has shifted to ~3 periods recently with multiple W=3 observations (Periods 5,6,9,10,14,18,24) and some variability; shipments have mostly arrived with ~3-period delay. Demand regime is sustained upward since Period 5 (much higher means). To protect service and cover the (L+1) periods of demand given longer lead time and high recent demand, set L explicitly to 3. Use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor forecasts to the most recent high-demand regime and capture recent volatility while avoiding dilution by much lower early-period data. These parameters prioritize avoiding stockouts under the new higher baseline and longer lead time while limiting excess inventory via recent-sample-based variance.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time shifted to ~3 periods (evidence: multiple concluded arrivals with lead_time=3 in Periods 5,6,9,10,14,18,24); sustained upward demand regime starting Period 5 (Periods 5+ show substantially higher mean than Periods 1-4).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/26 (Period 27). On-hand=537, in-transit=1037. Recent history shows a sustained upward demand regime starting Period 5 and multiple concluded arrivals with lead_time=3 (Periods 5,6,9,10,14,18,24,26), so actual lead time has shifted to ~3. I set L explicit=3 to protect against late arrivals. For demand I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the sustained high-demand regime (regime length since Period5 >20) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect recent elevated mean and volatility. These parameters bias orders upward to meet high demand while the capped policy will limit extreme overordering.

Period 28 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-09-02). Recent demand has cooled from the large summer peaks (Periods 18-22) to modest values in Periods 23-27 (309,176,132,155,139). Concluded arrivals show frequent 3-period lead times in recent history (many orders with W=3 across Periods 5,6,9,10,14,18,24,26), so treat actual lead time as 3 to be conservative. On-hand=840 and in-transit=829 (total pipeline large), so avoid aggressive replenishment to limit holding cost. Set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed arrivals; forecast demand using the most recent 5 periods to capture the current cooled regime; estimate volatility from the same recent 5 periods.

Period 29 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-09-09). Recent concluded arrivals show a sustained shift to ~3-period actual lead time across many periods (multiple W=3 observations). On-hand=762 and in-transit=829 (total pipeline large), so do not escalate target demand forecast. Set L explicit=3 to reflect observed actual lead time and avoid under-ordering given lost/late history. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend uses full-sample demand stats scaled by (1+L); this is conservative given sizable on-hand+pipeline and the pronounced historical high-demand regime earlier.

Period 30 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/16. Recent concluded arrivals show actual lead time has shifted to ~3 periods (multiple concluded W=3 across recent history). Current inventory is high (on-hand 697 + in-transit 829 = 1526) so be cautious on replenishment while respecting longer lead time. I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect sustained W=3 arrivals. Demand appears to have a recent lower realized sales run (Periods 25\u201329 demands = [132,155,139,78,65]) vs earlier high-season volumes; to make the OR engine responsive to this recent regime I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the policy targets (L+1)-period demand based on the latest observed demand pattern, reducing excess ordering risk given large pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time shifted to ~3 periods (evidence: multiple concluded arrivals with lead_time=3 across recent periods including Periods 5,6,9,10,14,18,24,26); retain sustained upward-demand regime flag from Period 5 only if future demand confirms, but current short-run demand (Periods 25\u201329) is lower.

Period 31 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/23 (Period 31). Inventory on-hand=901, in-transit=595. Historical concludes show frequent lead_time=3 in recent periods (arrivals with W=3 in Periods 5,6,9,10,14,18,24,26,30) \u2014 actual lead time has been ~3 and shipments have been delayed/variable vs promised 2. Demand regime: long-run uplift from Period 5 exists, but most recent periods (25\u201330) show a clear short-run decline (demands = [132,155,139,78,65,30], recent mean \u224899.8). To protect service against observed multi-period arrivals, set L=explicit 3. To align forecasts to recent lower demand, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 (capture Periods 25\u201330). This reduces over-ordering versus using the long-run high baseline while accounting for the longer actual lead time. These choices balance service (explicit L to avoid underordering due to late arrivals) and holding cost (recent demand window reduces mu_hat).

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time has shifted to ~3 periods (evidence: multiple concluded arrivals with lead_time=3 in Periods 5,6,9,10,14,18,24,26,30); short-run demand decline starting Period 25 (Periods 25\u201330 demands = [132,155,139,78,65,30], recent mean \u2248100).

Period 32 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/30 Period32. On-hand=866, in-transit=595. Historical concluded arrivals show frequent lead_time=3 in recent periods (Periods 5,6,9,10,14,18,24,26,30) and no recent shift back to promised 2 \u2014 treat actual lead time as 3. Demand regime: sustained high demand earlier (Period5+), but a clear short-run decline starting Period25 (Periods25\u201330 mean \u2248100). To protect against late arrivals I set L explicit=3. To reflect recent lower short-run demand I use recent_N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat (capture Period25\u201330). This keeps target inventory conservative given large on-hand/in-transit position and elevated lead time, balancing service vs holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time has shifted to ~3 periods (evidence: multiple concluded arrivals with lead_time=3 in Periods 5,6,9,10,14,18,24,26,30); short-run demand decline beginning Period25 (Periods25\u201330 mean \u2248100).

Period 33 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/10/7 (Period 33). Recent demand has fallen sharply since Period 25 (Periods 25\u201332 demands = [132,155,139,78,65,30,35,62], recent mean \u224898). Historical concluded arrivals show frequent lead_time=3 (many periods with W=3), so I treat actual lead time as 3 to avoid stockouts from late arrivals. On-hand (804) + in-transit (595) = 1,399 units \u2014 this covers multiple periods of current low demand but we must size orders to current lower regime. Therefore: set L explicitly to 3 (reflecting observed W=3); set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the most recent 8 demand observations (Periods 25\u201332) to capture the new low-demand regime and reduced variability, so the OR backend sizes base-stock for (1+L) review+lead horizon accordingly.

Carry-over insight: Short-run demand decline starting Period 25 confirmed: Periods 25\u201332 mean \u224898 (evidence: demands = [132,155,139,78,65,30,35,62]); actual lead time regime shifted to ~3 periods (multiple concluded arrivals with lead_time=3).

Period 34 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-14 (Period 34). Recent concluded arrivals show sustained actual lead-time \u22483 periods (multiple concluded arrivals with lead_time=3 across Periods 5,6,9,10,14,18,24,26,30). Demand regime: short-run decline confirmed starting Period 25; Periods 26\u201333 demands = [155,139,78,65,30,35,62,38], mean \u224875.25 and Periods 25\u201333 mean \u224898. To avoid overstock while covering review+lead demand (L+1 periods) I set L explicitly to 3 and use recent_N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor forecasts to the confirmed lower short-run regime. This keeps replenishment sized to current lower demand and accounts for the longer observed lead time so pipeline covers (1+L) periods of demand given possible arrival delays.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time regime shifted to \u22483 periods (evidence: multiple concluded arrivals with lead_time=3 across Periods 5,6,9,10,14,18,24,26,30); short-run demand decline confirmed starting Period 25 (Periods 26\u201333 mean \u224875.25) \u2014 use short-run mean for forecasts.

Period 35 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-21). On-hand=723, in-transit=595. Recent concluded arrivals show a sustained lead-time regime \u22483 periods (multiple concluded arrivals with W=3 across recent history). Demand has entered a short-run downshift starting Period 25; recent demands (Periods 27\u201334 = [139,78,65,30,35,62,38,43]) have mean \u224864. To protect against stockouts given longer actual lead time while avoiding excess holding cost from the recent low-demand regime, set L explicitly to 3 (reflecting observed arrivals) and use recent_N (N=8) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR baseline and volatility reflect the confirmed short-run lower-demand regime.

Period 36 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/10/28 (Period 36). Recent history shows a sustained short-run demand decline starting Period 25 (Periods 25\u201335 demands = [132,155,139,78,65,30,35,62,38,43,50], mean \u224875.2). Multiple concluded arrivals indicate actual lead time has settled at ~3 periods. Current inventory: on-hand=673, in-transit=595 (pipeline\u22481,268) \u2014 ample coverage vs. depressed recent demand, so avoid aggressive replenishment. I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed lead-time regime. For demand forecast and uncertainty I use recent_N over the short-run decline regime (N=11, Periods 25\u201335) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the lower recent mean and reduced volatility; this prevents the OR engine from over-ordering given large pipeline and the higher observed lead time. These choices balance service (cover (1+L) periods of low recent demand) against holding cost given high on-hand inventory and ongoing downward demand shift.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed: actual lead time regime \u22483 periods (multiple concluded arrivals with W=3 through Period 35); short-run demand decline starting Period 25 confirmed (Periods 25\u201335 mean \u224875.2) \u2014 use short-run mean for near-term forecasts.

Period 37 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 37). On-hand=637, in-transit=595. Historical concludes show actual lead time has settled at ~3 periods and a clear short-run demand decline beginning Period 25 (Periods 25\u201336 demands mean \u224871.9). To avoid overstock while covering the (L+1) review+lead demand, set lead time explicitly to 3 and forecast using the recent short-run regime (last 12 periods since the changepoint at Period 25). This yields conservative replenishment that aligns pipeline coverage with the lower recent demand and mitigates holding cost given high on-hand inventory.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time regime \u22483 periods (evidence: multiple concluded arrivals with lead_time=3 across Periods 5,6,9,10,14,18,24,26,30,35); short-run demand decline starting Period 25 confirmed (Periods 25\u201336 mean \u224871.9) \u2014 use short-run mean for near-term forecasts.

Period 38 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/11 (Period 38). Recent demand has declined since Period 25; last 10 periods (Periods 28\u201337) average demand ~47 units/period \u2014 use recent short-run mean. Many concluded arrivals show actual lead time \u22483 periods (sustained across multiple concluded messages). On-hand=603 and in-transit=595 is ample now, but we must set lead time to actual regime to size orders correctly. Therefore: set L explicitly to 3 (reflects observed concluded lead_time=3 regime); set mu_hat using recent_N (captures short-run lower demand) with N=10 (Periods 28\u201337); set sigma_hat using recent_N with N=10 to reflect recent lower-volatility regime. This balances service (use observed longer lead time to avoid stockouts) against holding cost by forecasting lower near-term demand from the confirmed decline.

Period 39 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/18 (Period 39). Recent history shows a sustained short-run demand decline beginning Period 25 (Periods 25\u201338 demands average ~75\u2013100) and multiple concluded arrivals with lead_time=3 across recent periods. Current inventory: on-hand=561, in-transit=595. To avoid overstock given low recent demand and confirmed longer lead time, set lead time explicitly to 3. Forecast (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) use recent_N to capture the short-run low-demand regime; N=14 (Periods 25\u201338) balances responsiveness and sample size. These choices lower the (1+L)-period demand forecast and reduce order quantities, trading service for lower holding costs given large on-hand + in-transit stock.

Period 40 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/25 (Period 40). Recent history shows a sustained shift to a ~3-period actual lead time (multiple concluded arrivals with W=3) and a clear short-run demand decline starting Period 25. Current on-hand=544 + in-transit=595 provides ample coverage now, but with lead_time\u22483 we must forecast over (1+L)=4 periods. I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed arrivals and avoid underordering due to lost/slow shipments. For demand I use recent_N (N=15, Periods 25\u201339) to capture the confirmed low-demand regime (mean \u224863.7 over those 15 periods \u2192 (1+L)\xd7mean \u2248255 forecasted demand over review+lead). I use recent_N for sigma_hat with the same N to reflect recent lower volatility. These parameters bias the OR backend toward ordering for the current low-demand regime while accounting for the longer actual lead time, balancing service level (avoid stockouts given L\u22483) against holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time regime shifted to \u22483 periods (evidence: multiple concluded arrivals with lead_time=3 across Periods 5,6,9,10,14,18,24,26,30,35); confirmed short-run demand decline starting Period 25 (Periods 25\u201339 mean \u224863.7) \u2014 use short-run mean for near-term forecasts.

Period 41 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/2 (Period 41). Historical concludes show a sustained actual lead-time regime \u22483 periods (multiple concluded arrivals with lead_time=3 across Periods 5,6,9,10,14,18,24,26,30,35). Demand has fallen into a short-run low regime starting Period 25 (Periods 25\u201339 mean \u224863.7; recent periods remain low). On-hand=431 and in-transit=595 provide substantial pipeline, but given observed lead-time=3 we must plan for (1+L) periods of demand. Set L explicitly to 3 to reflect the observed delivery behavior (avoids under-ordering from underestimated lead time). For demand forecast use recent_N over the short-run low-demand regime (use last 16 periods since Period 25\u201340) so mu_hat=(1+L)\xd7mean(last 16 samples) capturing the new baseline. Use recent_N for sigma_hat with N=16 to reflect recent volatility during the low-demand regime. These choices prioritize avoiding stockouts given long/variable lead times while shrinking forecasts to match the confirmed low-demand regime, balancing service and holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time regime shifted to \u22483 periods (evidence: multiple concluded arrivals with lead_time=3 across many periods including recent ones); short-run demand decline confirmed starting Period 25 (Periods 25\u201339 mean \u224863.7) \u2014 use short-run mean for near-term forecasts.

Period 42 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/9 (Period 42). On-hand=380, in-transit=595 (total pipeline 975) \u2014 ample stock vs. recent low demand. Historical concluded lead-times show a sustained shift to ~3 periods (many concluded W=3 in recent history). Demand regime: strong decline starting Period 25; use short-run recent demands for forecast. Set L explicit=3 to reflect observed actual lead-time regime. Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat using the recent short-run regime (Periods 25\u201341, 17 samples) so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility from the low-demand regime, avoiding excess future orders while covering the longer lead time.

Carry-over insight: New sustained actual lead-time \u22483 periods (multiple concluded arrivals with lead_time=3 across recent history); short-run demand decline confirmed starting Period 25 (Periods 25\u201341 mean demand substantially lower than pre-25).

Period 43 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16 (Period 43). Recent history shows sustained actual lead-time \u22483 periods (multiple concluded arrivals with W=3 across many periods) and a clear short-run demand decline beginning Period 25. On-hand=323, in-transit=595. To avoid stockouts given longer actual lead time, set L explicitly to 3. For demand forecast use the short-run regime (Period 25\u201342) via recent_N with N=18 (regime length=18 \u2192 N=18) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend uses the near-term lower mean and volatility. This balances service (cover longer lead time) while avoiding excess holding by anchoring forecasts to the confirmed lower-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time regime \u22483 periods (evidence: multiple concluded arrivals with lead_time=3 across Periods 5,6,9,10,14,18,24,26,30,35, etc.); short-run demand decline starting Period 25 confirmed (use Periods 25\u201342 as near-term basis).

On-hand=208 and in-transit=595 (pipeline large); to avoid stockouts given L\u22483 and the lower recent demand, set lead time to explicit 3 and base mu/sigma on the recent 20-period regime to reflect current lower demand and volatility while keeping safety stock minimal to limit holding cost.
