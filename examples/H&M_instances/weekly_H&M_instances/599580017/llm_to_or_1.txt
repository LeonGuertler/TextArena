Using initial samples from train.csv: D:\TextArena\examples\H&M_instances\weekly_H&M_instances\599580017\train.csv
  Samples: [61, 98, 152, 129, 213]
  Mean: 130.6, Count: 5
Promised lead time (shown to LLM): 0 periods (1 period = 14 days)
Note: Actual lead times in CSV may differ and will be inferred by LLM from arrivals.
Running full CSV horizon: 45 periods

Period 1 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date is 2019-02-25 (late Feb) \u2014 swimwear demand may pick up toward spring but no concrete upward shift in the provided history. No 'Period conclude' messages or arrivals to infer lead-time changes. Use promised lead time (0) and full-sample demand stats to seed the OR engine conservatively. This yields mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) to reflect typical review+lead demand, and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples) to capture observed variability. These parameters balance service (use historical mean) against holding cost (avoid inflating demand forecast without evidence).

Carry-over insight: (empty)

Daily Reward (R_t): $312.00

Period 2 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Swimwear SKU with recent high demand variability; last period order (Period 1) arrived same-period (arrived=156, lead_time=0), so no evidence of transit delays. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must cover current-period demand. Use promised/default lead time (L=0) confirmed by concluded arrival. Set mu_hat as default (1+L)*mean(all samples)=130.6 to target average demand; set sigma_hat as default sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples)=51.298 to reflect observed variability. These parameters balance service (z driven by profit/(profit+holding)=2/(2+1)=0.6667 \u2192 moderate service level) versus holding cost given high demand variance.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead time = 0 periods based on Period 1 conclude: ordered=156 arrived=156 (ordered on Period 1, lead_time was 0 periods).
