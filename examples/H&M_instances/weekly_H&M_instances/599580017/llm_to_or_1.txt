Period 1 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019-02-25). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. No concluded arrivals exist yet so actual lead time cannot be inferred; use promised lead time. Historical demands = [61,98,152,129,213] with no clear recent changepoint; use full-sample defaults so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This balances service vs holding cost given profit $2 and holding $1 by letting OR engine set z* from cost ratio.

Period 2 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 (2019-03-04). On-hand=0, in-transit=225 (order placed Period 1). Period 1 conclude shows ordered=225 arrived=0 which is consistent with promised lead time=2 (arrival expected in Period 3, visible in Period 4 conclude). No concluded arrivals yet \u2192 no evidence of lost shipment or lead-time deviation. Demand history: [61,98,152,129,213], mean=130.6. I keep L as default (promised 2) and use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample; this is conservative given limited data and aligns expected pipeline (in-transit + on-hand) with forecasted (L+1)-period demand while avoiding premature manual adjustments for potentially on-time shipment.

Period 3 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/11 (Period 3). Recent history: Period1 order (225) arrived in Period2 with observed lead_time=1. On-hand=52, in-transit=228 (order placed Period2). Promised L=2 but observed lead-time evidence indicates actual lead time=1 so far. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times to let backend average observed lead times; mu_hat and sigma_hat use defaults so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing a demand buffer for the review+lead period while keeping parameter updates simple given limited lead-time samples. This balances service vs holding cost and flags that the in-transit 228 may arrive sooner than promised.

Carry-over insight: Observed lead time = 1 period (Period2 conclude: arrived=225 units ordered on Period1, lead_time was 1).

Period 4 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (2019-03-18). On-hand=0, in-transit=266. Historical demands = [61,98,152,129,213]. Concluded observation: Period2 arrival shows an actual lead time of 1 period. Use lead-time inference from concluded history (calculate). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat to leverage full-sample mean/variance so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std; this balances service vs holding cost given limited samples and the observed shorter lead time.

Period 5 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/25 (Period 5). On-hand=0, in-transit=326; recent concluded history shows one observed lead time = 1 period (Period2 conclude: arrived=225 ordered on Period1). Promised L=2 but observed evidence supports actual L\u22481; choose L by 'calculate' (avg observed). Demand history shows no clear recent downward shift; use default demand estimates so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This keeps orders sized to cover current + lead periods while letting the OR engine apply its service-level cap; using observed shorter lead-time reduces pipeline target and holding costs given zero on-hand and significant in-transit units.

Carry-over insight: Observed lead time = 1 period; evidence: Period2 conclude: arrived=225 units ordered on Period1 (lead_time=1).

Period 6 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-04-01). Recent demand has been high and variable (historical samples [61,98,152,129,213]; recent concluded demands include outages where on-hand hit 0 frequently). On-hand=0, in-transit=110 (matches outstanding orders: Period3 ordered=38, Period4 ordered=60, Period5 ordered=12) \u2014 these shipments are in-transit and may be delayed but not yet confirmed lost. Concluded arrivals show mixed lead times: Period2 conclude: order on P1 arrived with lead_time=1; Period5 conclude: order on P2 arrived with lead_time=3. I set L using calculate to reflect observed lead-time regime (average observed lead_time = 2). For demand parameters I use default methods so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples; this leverages full history to balance service vs holding cost given lead-time uncertainty and variable demand.

Carry-over insight: Observed lead_time variability: concluded lead_times = 1 (P2 conclude: order P1) and 3 (P5 conclude: order P2) \u2192 average observed lead_time = 2; in-transit =110 equals sum of outstanding orders (38+60+12), indicating delayed but not yet lost shipments.

Period 7 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/8 (Period 7). Recent concluded history shows mixed lead times: observed lead_times = 1 (P2 conclude for order P1), 3 (P5 for P2), 3 (P6 for P3), 2 (P6 for P4) \u21d2 average \u22482.25. On-hand=0, in-transit=268 which matches sum of outstanding orders; shipments delayed but currently present in pipeline (not lost). To account for realized longer/mixed lead times use calculated average lead time so backend inflates pipeline coverage; demand history samples [61,98,152,129,213] are used by default formulas scaled by (1+L). Using default mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the OR engine compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, which balances higher safety stock (due to increased L) against holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Carry-over insight: Observed lead_time regime shifted from promised 2 to variable observed values (1,3,3,2); average observed lead_time \u22482.25 indicating prolonged/delayed shipments but in-transit totals match outstanding orders (no confirmed losses).

Period 8 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Concluded lead_times = [1,3,3,2] \u2192 avg = 2.25 indicating realized lead_time longer/variable than promised. Use L="calculate" so backend averages observed lead times (captures recent variability). Use mu_hat="default" and sigma_hat="default" so demand forecasts scale with the inferred L and historical samples; this raises target pipeline to cover the longer effective lead time while the capped order cap limits excess inventory given $2 profit / $1 holding.

Period 9 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-22). On-hand=0, in-transit=440 (outstanding shipments present, no confirmed losses). Concluded lead_times = [1,3,3,2] \u2192 variable but average \u22482.25; use 'calculate' so backend averages observed lead times. Demand has stepped up recently (large demands P4\u2013P8); I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new high-demand regime (last 5 demand samples) so base_stock and caps reflect elevated demand while accounting for observed delayed arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime increased starting around Period 4\u20135; recent 5-period mean demand \u2248301 (Periods 4\u20138), sustained higher volatility; observed lead_time variability averaged \u22482.25 with no confirmed losses (in-transit matches outstanding orders).

Daily Reward (R_t): $552.00

Period 10 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-29): demand has clearly stepped up since ~Period 4\u20135 (recent 5-period mean \u2248301) and lead times have been variable and longer than the promised 2 (observed lead_times = 1,3,3,2 -> avg \u22482.25). On-hand=0, in-transit=371 equals outstanding orders (no confirmed losses). To cover higher demand and account for prolonged/variable transit I set L explicit to the observed avg (2.25) so the OR backend plans over the longer effective lead time. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the new higher-demand regime (gives (1+L)\xd7recent mean) and recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect increased recent volatility. This combination increases target base-stock to improve service during elevated demand and cushions against lead-time variability while avoiding overstatement from older low-demand periods.

Period 11 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-05-06). Recent demand has materially increased since Period 4\u20135 with high volatility; last 5-period demands (P6\u2013P10) = [376,295,367,477,468], mean \u2248396.6. On-hand=0, in-transit=710 which matches outstanding orders (no confirmed losses), but observed lead_times have been variable (1,3,3,2,3,1,3) \u2192 average \u22482.29, so treat lead time as higher/variable than the promised 2. Choose L via 'calculate' to let backend use observed lead-time history. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the elevated mean and volatility from the most recent regime (P6\u2013P10). This raises target base-stock to meet high near-term demand while sigma_hat recent_N captures increased uncertainty to avoid stockouts given variable lead times.

Period 12 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-05-13). On-hand=0, in-transit=633 which matches sum of outstanding orders \u2192 no confirmed lost shipments but shipments are delayed/variable. Historical concluded lead_times = [1,3,3,2,2] (avg \u22482.25) so I set L explicitly to 2.25 to reflect the observed slower/variable pipeline. Demand regime has increased since Period 4\u20135; use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets the (1+L)-period demand using the most recent high-demand regime (captures recent mean \u2248301 and elevated volatility). This balances higher service requirement from elevated demand against holding cost by sizing base_stock from recent demand and observed lead time.

Period 13 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20 (Period 13). Demand has been elevated since Period 4\u20135 with recent 5-period mean \u2248412 units (Periods 8\u201312 = 367,477,468,332,417). Concluded lead-time observations = [1,3,3,2,3,3,2] \u2192 avg \u22482.43; in-transit (1155) matches outstanding orders (no confirmed losses). Set L to be calculated from observed concluded lead times to let backend use empirical average. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new high-demand regime (most weight on recent elevated periods). This choice raises target base stock to cover the higher recent demand while sigma estimated over the same recent window captures increased volatility; together they balance higher service level against holding cost given profit=$2 and hold=$1.

Carry-over insight: Updated observed lead-time average from concluded shipments = 2.43 (observed lead_times: 1,3,3,2,3,3,2); sustained demand increase: recent 5-period mean \u2248412 (Periods 8\u201312).

On-hand=0, in-transit=1155 which matches outstanding orders (no confirmed losses). Observed concluded lead_times average \u22482.43 and are variable; use backend's calculate to let it average observed lead times. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent 5 periods to capture the new higher mean and elevated volatility, which raises the base-stock and safety stock and helps reduce costly stockouts while accepting higher holding cost trade-off given profit/holding ratio.

Period 15 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019/6/3). On-hand=0, in-transit=1025 which matches outstanding orders (no confirmed losses). Historical concluded lead_times show variability and a multi-period elevated average (~2.4), and demand has shifted up since Period 4\u20135 with recent periods much higher. Set L via 'calculate' to let backend use observed average lead time from concluded history. For demand and volatility use recent_N with N=5 to capture the sustained higher mean and elevated variance (recent 5-period demand spike). These parameters aim to raise the base-stock to cover the longer observed lead-time and higher recent demand while reflecting current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Observed lead_time average \u22482.43 from concluded shipments (lead_times: 1,3,3,2,3,3,2); in-transit totals (1025) match outstanding orders \u2192 delayed but not lost. Sustained demand increase since Period 4\u20135; recent 5-period mean elevated (~412).

Period 16 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-06-10). Recent demand regime is elevated since Period 4\u20135; last 5 demands (Periods 11\u201315) average \u2248369.8 with high variance. On-hand=0, in-transit=1025 which matches outstanding orders (delayed but not lost). Concluded lead-times show a sustained slower/variable regime; average observed lead_time \u22482.43. To protect service given high demand and delayed arrivals, set lead time explicitly to the observed average (L=2.43) and forecast demand using the most recent regime (recent_N=5) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the elevated mean and volatility over the last 5 periods. This biases orders upward to cover the longer effective pipeline while letting the OR backend compute safety stock from the supplied variability.

Period 17 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-17). On-hand=0, in-transit=1419 which matches outstanding orders \u2192 shipments delayed but not lost. Historical concluded lead_times = [1,3,3,2,3,3,2] \u2192 average \u22482.43, so use explicit L to reflect prolonged/variable lead time. Demand has been elevated since Period 4\u20135; most recent 5-period demands (Periods 12\u201316) = [417,370,525,330,302], mean \u2248388.8. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the current higher-demand regime and recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. These choices bias orders toward higher cover for longer/variable lead times while keeping variance based on the most recent demand pattern.

Carry-over insight: Observed lead_time average sustained \u22482.43 from concluded shipments (lead_times: 1,3,3,2,3,3,2); in-transit totals match outstanding orders indicating delays not losses. Recent 5-period mean demand (Periods 12\u201316) \u2248388.8, confirming elevated demand regime.

Period 19 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019/7/1). Demand has risen sharply since Period 4\u20135 and remains elevated; recent 5-period demands (Periods 14\u201318) = [525,330,302,517,771], mean \u2248489, high volatility. Concluded shipments show sustained observed lead_time average \u22482.43 (observed lead_times: 1,3,3,2,3,3,2) and in-transit totals match outstanding orders (delays, not losses). To cover the elevated demand and account for prolonged/variable lead time, I set L explicit=2.43 (use observed lead-time average), mu_hat based on recent 5-period mean to capture current demand regime, and sigma_hat on recent 5-period volatility to reflect higher uncertainty. This raises target base-stock to improve service under delayed arrivals while accounting for holding cost via backend cap.

Carry-over insight: Observed lead_time average elevated to ~2.43 from concluded shipments (lead_times: 1,3,3,2,3,3,2); in-transit totals match outstanding orders indicating delays not losses; sustained demand increase since Period 4\u20135 with recent 5-period mean \u2248489 (Periods 14\u201318) and elevated volatility.

Period 20 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/8 (Period 20). Recent concluded shipments show observed lead_times average ~2.43 and in-transit (1828) matches outstanding orders, indicating delays rather than lost shipments. Demand has been elevated since Period 4\u20135; recent periods (15\u201319) demands = [330,302,517,771,592], mean \u2248502.4. I set L to the explicit observed average (2.43) to account for prolonged delays. mu_hat is explicit = (1+L)*recent_mean \u22483.43*502.4 \u22481723.2 to cover review+lead demand under the higher regime. sigma_hat explicit \u2248359 to reflect elevated volatility (sample std of recent demand scaled for review+lead). These parameters increase safety stock to avoid stockouts given delayed arrivals while recognizing holding cost tradeoff.

Carry-over insight: Observed lead_time average \u22482.43 from concluded shipments (lead_times: 1,3,3,2,3,3,2); in-transit totals match outstanding orders (delayed, not lost). Sustained demand increase since Period 4\u20135; recent 5-period mean (Periods 15\u201319) \u2248502.4 with elevated volatility.

Demand regime rose since Period 4\u20135; recent volatility and mean are elevated (recent 5-period demand mean \u2248502). To protect availability given delayed arrivals, set lead-time estimate explicitly to observed average (L=2.43). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to target the current high-demand, high-volatility regime so the OR backend sizes base_stock to cover (1+L) periods of elevated demand while reflecting recent variance.

Period 22 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Demand has been in a sustained higher regime since ~Period 4\u20135 and recent 5-period mean (P17\u2013P21) = 586.4; concluded lead-times show a shifted, variable regime averaging ~2.43 and in-transit totals match outstanding orders (delayed, not lost). To reflect the observed longer lead-time I set L explicit=2.43. For demand forecast and volatility I use recent 5-period statistics to capture the elevated mean/variance (mu_hat recent_N N=5, sigma_hat recent_N N=5). These choices raise the base-stock target to cover the longer, variable lead time and higher recent demand while letting the OR backend compute safety stock consistent with observed volatility; treating shipments as delayed (not lost) avoids reducing pipeline.

In-transit=2048 matches outstanding orders -> delays not confirmed losses. Concluded lead_times remain skewed above promised (observed concluded lead_times: 1,3,3,2,3,3,2 -> avg \u22482.43). To cover the longer effective lead time and the new higher-demand regime while accounting for delayed arrivals, set L explicitly to the observed average (explicit L=2.43). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so forecasts reflect the elevated recent demand and volatility (N=5 chosen because a sustained demand shift is evident starting around Periods 18\u201322). This increases the base-stock and safety buffer to protect service level given delayed shipments while accepting higher holding cost consistent with profit/holding ratio.

Carry-over insight: Updated observed lead_time average \u22482.43 from concluded shipments (lead_times: 1,3,3,2,3,3,2). Sustained demand increase: recent 5-period mean = 625 (Periods 18\u201322 = 771,592,542,510,710); in-transit totals (2048) match outstanding orders -> delays not losses.

Period 24 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-08-05). Demand has been in a sustained higher regime since ~Period 4\u20135; recent volatility is high. Concluded shipments imply observed lead_time average \u22482.43 and in-transit totals match outstanding orders (delays, not losses). On-hand=127 + in-transit=1797 gives substantial pipeline cover but recent demands (Periods 19\u201323) remain elevated. To capture the elevated demand regime while accounting for observed prolonged lead times I set L explicitly to the observed average (2.43), use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to target the most recent demand level, and recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect current high volatility. These choices steer the backend to a larger base-stock appropriate for the new demand regime while acknowledging delayed arrivals.

Period 25 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/12 (Period 25). On-hand=76, in-transit=1692; concluded-history shows observed lead_times average \u22482.43 and in-transit totals consistently match outstanding orders (delays, not losses). Recent demand has been elevated; last 5 periods (P20\u2013P24) demand = [542,510,710,309,176], mean \u2248449.4. To protect service given prolonged delays I set lead time explicit to the observed average (L=2.43), used an explicit mu_hat to capture (1+L)\xd7forecast demand with a per-period forecast \u2248450 \u2192 mu_hat \u22483.43\xd7450=1543.5, and an explicit sigma_hat to reflect elevated volatility (estimated \u03c3\u0302 \u2248387). These parameters raise base-stock to cover the prolonged/variable lead time and current high demand while acknowledging holding cost trade-offs.

Period 26 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-19). Demand has been in a higher, volatile regime since ~Period 4\u20135; recent history shows large swings but elevated mean. On-hand=0, in-transit=1672 which matches outstanding orders (delayed shipments, not lost). Observed average concluded lead_time \u22482.43 periods (from concluded shipments), so I set L explicitly to 2.43 to reflect actual delays. For demand forecast I use recent 5-period data to capture the current elevated but volatile regime (N=5). Same recent 5-period window used for sigma to reflect current volatility. These parameters push the OR engine to size base_stock for the longer observed lead time and for the recent elevated demand while capturing higher variance to reduce stockouts given shipments are delayed but expected to arrive.

Historical concluded lead_times average \u22482.43 (concluded shipments sequence: 1,3,3,2,3,3,2) \u2014 I set L explicit to 2.43 to reflect observed delays. Demand regime rose earlier in the run; to capture the most recent realized demand I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat (covers Periods 23\u201327 demands = 309,176,132,155,139) so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7recent mean. I keep sigma_hat as default so the OR engine uses full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). These choices aim to size orders for the longer observed lead time while anchoring forecast to the most recent demand window and letting OR compute safety stock from overall volatility.

Historical concluded lead_times average \u22482.43 (1,3,3,2,3,3,2); demand has been volatile with recent downward movement in last 5 periods (Periods24\u201328 mean=136) but upstream pipeline remains large. Set L explicit to 2.43 to reflect observed realized lead-time (promised=2 but shipments delayed). For demand forecast use recent_N (N=5) to capture the most recent realized demand level over the review+lead horizon and avoid over-ordering against earlier spikes.

Observed concluded lead_times average \u22482.43 from prior conclude messages; demand regime has been elevated and shipments are delayed, so raise effective lead time and target stock to avoid stockouts. Set L explicit=2.43 to reflect observed average lead time. Set mu_hat explicit high to cover (1+L) periods of elevated demand given large in-transit and recent volatility; chosen (1+2.43)\xd7~500 \u22481715 to bias toward service. Set sigma_hat explicit to 400 to reflect elevated demand volatility and to increase safety stock. These parameters prioritize avoiding stockouts given delayed but intact pipeline and high recent demand, balancing holding cost by not inflating sigma_hat excessively.

Period 31 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019/9/23). Recent concluded shipments show a sustained elevated/variable actual lead time \u22482.43 periods and in-transit totals match outstanding orders (delays, not losses). Recent on-shelf demand has fallen sharply over the last 5 periods (Periods 26\u201330 = 155,139,78,65,30) so I base demand forecast on the most recent 5 samples to adapt quickly. To reflect observed lead-time delays I set L explicitly to the inferred 2.43. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the latest lower mean and volatility so orders won't overshoot given large in-transit inventory (1888 units).

Carry-over insight: Observed lead_time average from concluded shipments \u22482.43 (lead_times observed: 1,3,3,2,3,3,2); in-transit totals match outstanding orders \u2192 delayed but not lost shipments.

Period 32 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:

Demand has been volatile with a marked surge earlier but the last 5 concluded periods (Periods 27-31) show much lower demand; to avoid overreacting to earlier surge while respecting delayed shipments, I set L explicitly to observed average 2.43. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to forecast (1+L)-period demand using the most recent demand regime, and recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture current volatility. This balances service (accounting for prolonged lead-time) against holding cost given large pipeline inventory (1888 units) already en route.

Demand has shown regime shifts historically; using the observed lead-time regime explicitly (L=2.43) aligns ordering cadence with delayed arrivals. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to default so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, providing a robust baseline given variable demand and preserving the backend's service-level calibration (profit/holding tradeoff).

Date 2019/10/14 (Period 34). Historical concluded shipments show an elevated, variable observed lead time averaging \u22482.43 periods (concluded lead_times: 1,3,3,2,3,3,2). On-hand=301, in-transit=1487 (matches outstanding orders \u2192 delayed, not lost).

Set L explicit to 2.43 to reflect observed prolonged/delayed shipments; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture the current low-demand short-term regime and elevated volatility estimates from recent samples. These choices keep pipeline covering the longer effective lead time while preventing overstock driven by older high-demand periods.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/10/21 (Period 35). On-hand=258, in-transit=1487. Concluded history shows variable but elevated observed lead_times (series average \u22482.43) and previous prolonged delays with in-transit matching outstanding orders (delays, not losses). Recent demand has been low across the last 5 periods (Periods 30\u201334: 30,35,62,38,43) after earlier high-season spikes. To protect service given persistent delayed arrivals, I set lead time explicitly to the observed average (longer than promised). For demand estimate I use the most recent 5 periods to reflect the current low-demand regime. Volatility uses default to let backend scale with (1+L). These choices increase pipeline cover for delayed shipments while keeping forecast aligned to recent softened demand to avoid excess holding cost.

Demand regime has varied; latest on-hand=208 with large pipeline. I set L explicit to 2.43 to reflect observed realized delays so the OR engine plans for longer arrivals. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the most recent demand regime for the (1+L) review+lead window. I keep sigma_hat as default so the backend uses overall sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). These choices prioritize avoiding stockouts given confirmed prolonged lead-times while not wildly overstating variance.

Period 37 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-11-04). On-hand=172, In-transit=1487 \u2192 pipeline+on-hand=1659 which matches outstanding orders (delayed, not lost). Historical concluded lead_times average \u22482.43 (sustained across concluded shipments); recent demand has normalized to low post-season levels (recent 5 demands: 62,38,43,50,36). Therefore: set lead time to explicit observed average to capture prolonged/delayed shipments; use a recent-5 demand estimate for mu_hat to reflect current low-season demand; keep sigma_hat as default so OR backend uses full-sample volatility scaled by (1+L). This balances service (accounting for longer effective lead time) against holding cost given large pipeline.

Period 38 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 38). Historical concluded lead_times show a sustained elevated average \u22482.43 (concluded lead_times: 1,3,3,2,3,3,2) and in-transit totals have consistently matched outstanding orders (delays, not losses). Recent on-hand=138, in-transit=1487. Demand regime rose earlier in the year but the most recent 5 realized demands (Periods 33-37 = 38,43,50,36,34) indicate a lower current demand regime; therefore use a short recent window to set demand forecast while explicitly accounting for longer realized lead time. I set L explicit=2.43 to reflect observed concluded lead-time average so the OR backend sizes pipeline appropriately; mu_hat uses recent_N (N=5) to capture the current lower demand level across the review+lead period; sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=5) to capture recent variability. This balances avoiding large overorders given high in-transit stock while ensuring pipeline covers the empirically observed delayed arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Observed concluded lead_time average \u22482.43 (from concluded lead_times 1,3,3,2,3,3,2); in-transit totals have matched outstanding orders => delays not confirmed losses.

Period 39 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-18). Recent demand (Periods 34-38) is low (~41 units/week) after earlier high-season spikes; on-hand=96 and in-transit=1487 (pipeline >> near-term demand). Historical concluded lead_times average \u22482.43 (sustained). To avoid overstocking while accounting for delayed arrivals, set lead-time to the observed average (explicit=2.43). Forecast demand across review+lead using the most recent stable regime (last 5 periods) so mu_hat reflects current low demand. Use recent 5-period sigma to capture current low volatility. This keeps base-stock modest given high pipeline and long effective lead-time, reducing holding costs while preserving service.

Period 40 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/25 (Period 40). History of concluded arrivals shows persistent lead-time regime longer than promised with average observed lead_time \u22482.43 (concluded lead_times sequence: 1,3,3,2,3,3,2). In-transit (1487) matches outstanding orders \u2192 delays not confirmed losses. To hedge delayed arrivals I set L explicit to the observed average (2.43). Demand recently has high variability historically; use backend defaults for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history, letting the engine's capped policy compute orders given the shifted L. This balances service (cover delayed lead times) vs. holding cost given large in-transit stock.

LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019/12/2). Recent on-hand=0, in-transit=1487 (matches outstanding orders \u2192 delayed but not lost). Recent demand has cooled sharply (Periods 36\u201340 demand = [36,34,42,17,113], recent 5-mean \u224848.4) despite earlier seasonal spikes; observed concluded lead-times historically average \u22482.43. To cover the longer observed lead-time while reflecting current low recent demand I set L explicit=2.43 and use recent-5 demand estimates so the backend builds base-stock for the current low-demand regime while accounting for delayed arrivals. Using recent_N for sigma captures current reduced volatility and prevents excessive safety stock/holding cost.

Recent demand has fallen from summer peaks; last 5 demands (Periods 37\u201341) = [34,42,17,113,51] indicating a lower recent mean and volatility. To capture observed longer-than-promised lead-times I set L explicit=2.43. To reflect the immediate recent demand regime I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend sizes the review+lead demand around the most recent demand pattern, reducing excess holding while preserving service given long, variable lead-times.

LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-16). On-hand=0, in-transit=1487 (pipeline matches outstanding orders => delayed, not lost). Concluded lead-times average \u22482.43 (observed sequence 1,3,3,2,3,3,2); therefore set L explicitly to 2.43 to reflect realized delays. Recent demand has dropped (Periods 38\u201342 demands = 42,17,113,51,57; 5-period mean \u224856), so use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to align base-stock to the current low-season demand and avoid excess holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Observed concluded lead_time average \u22482.43 from multiple concluded shipments (lead_times: 1,3,3,2,3,3,2); in-transit totals consistently match outstanding orders indicating delays rather than confirmed losses. Recent demand has materially softened in the last 5 periods (Periods 38\u201342 mean \u224856) \u2014 short-term regime drop likely due to seasonality.

Observed concluded lead-time history consistently averages \u22482.43 \u2014 use that as the best current L. To avoid overstock given the short-term demand drop, set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent 5 periods to reflect the lower recent mean and reduced volatility; this lowers the OR base-stock and caps, reducing holding cost risk while remaining responsive if demand rebounds.
