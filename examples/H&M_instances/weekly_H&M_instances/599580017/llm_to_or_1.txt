Period 1 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25: product is swimwear (seasonal demand rising into spring/summer). Historical demands: [61,98,152,129,213] show elevated recent values but no clear changepoint yet. No on-hand or in-transit inventory and no observed lead-time evidence, so use promised lead time and population statistics. Set L=default to rely on promised 4-period lead time; mu_hat=default to let backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) capturing overall average demand across review+lead; sigma_hat=default to let backend compute variability = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples). This balances service level (accounts for observed variability) against holding cost without overreacting to limited recent uptick.

Period 2 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/4 (Period 2). On-hand=0, in-transit=225 (order placed Period 1 shows arrived=0 in Period 1 conclude). Promised lead time is 4 and no concluded arrivals yet, so actual lead time is unobserved \u2014 do not infer delays. Historical demand samples = [61,98,152,129,213] (mean\u2248130.6). Given no evidence of a demand regime change and absence of confirmed lead-time deviations, use default settings so the OR engine applies its (1+L) demand aggregation and volatility scaling. This preserves service level while avoiding overreacting to an unconfirmed missing arrival.

Period 3 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/11 (Period 3). On-hand=0, in-transit=453 from prior orders. Two concluded periods (P1,P2) show ordered but arrived=0 \u2014 no concluded arrivals yet, so actual lead time cannot be computed from concluded messages. Risk of delayed or lost shipments exists but is unconfirmed. I keep L at the promised lead time to let the OR engine use its known lead-time assumption, and use default demand estimates based on all historical samples (mean and std of demands [61,98,152,129,213]) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the full-sample baseline ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This balances service-level needs (avoid stockouts given zero on-hand and large pipeline) while avoiding overreacting to unconfirmed arrival losses.

Carry-over insight: Orders placed in Periods 1\u20132 (225,228) have not concluded (arrived=0) \u2014 suggests lead-time delays or potential lost shipments; evidence: Period 1 conclude arrived=0 (ordered P1), Period 2 conclude arrived=0 (ordered P2).

Period 4 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 4). Recent concludes show orders placed in Periods 1\u20133 (225,228,228) have not arrived by their conclude messages \u2192 signals lead-time elongation or lost shipments. Current on-hand=0, in-transit=681 (pipeline exists but past promised arrivals missing). To avoid under-ordering if shipments are delayed or lost, I explicitly increase L to reflect extended lead time while using short-window demand estimates to capture the recent higher demand regime (Periods 1\u20133: demands 175,173,181). Selected methods: L explicit=6 to conservatively cover potential delayed arrivals; mu_hat recent_N (N=3) to base replenishment on the immediate observed demand spike; sigma_hat recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent volatility. This raises the base-stock target to preserve service despite missing arrivals while keeping variability estimates focused on the newest regime to avoid over-inflating safety stock.

Period 5 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/25 (Period 5). Recent concluded history shows four consecutive orders (P1\u2013P4) have not arrived (arrived=0), indicating the promised L=4 is underestimating actual lead time or shipments are lost. Demand sequence [61,98,152,129,213] shows a clear uptick in most recent samples (last 3 mean=166 vs overall mean=130.6) consistent with seasonal swimwear pick-up in March. On-hand=0, in-transit=865 (undelivered) \u2014 pipeline appears large but unconfirmed by concludes, so assume longer effective lead time to avoid underordering while using recent higher demand for forecast. Decisions: set L explicit=6 to reflect prolonged/no-arrival regime; use mu_hat recent_N with N=3 to capture recent demand increase ((1+L) scaled by recent mean); use sigma_hat recent_N N=3 to reflect recent demand volatility. These choices bias orders toward covering the longer effective replenishment horizon and higher recent demand while keeping variance estimate tied to recent samples to compute safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Orders placed in Periods 1\u20134 repeatedly concluded with arrived=0 -> sustained lead-time failure or lost shipments; evidence: Period 1\u20134 conclude all arrived=0 for orders placed P1\u2013P4. Treat effective lead time as longer than promised until concludes resume.

Period 6 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 6). Recent concludes show prolonged arrival failures for orders P1\u2013P4 but Period 5 conclude recorded arrived=225 for order placed in P1 with lead_time=4. Current on-hand=0, in-transit=848. Given the confirmed 4-period arrival (one observed sample) and elevated pipeline, use lead-time inferred from observed concludes. Use default demand aggregation over the (1+L) review+lead horizon to let OR backend compute base-stock from full-sample mean/variance. This balances service (use observed L) while avoiding overfitting to the recent intermittent no-arrival pattern; holding cost is non-trivial so avoid explicit upsizing of mu_hat beyond historical mean.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods based on Period 5 conclude: arrived=225 (ordered P1, lead_time=4). Treat lead time as 4 until future concludes indicate change.

Period 7 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-04-08): recent concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 (Period5: P1 arrived lead_time=4; Period6: P2 arrived lead_time=4). On-hand=0, in-transit=654 (covers future demand). Demand signal: swimwear season ramping but historical sample mean used as stable prior. Use explicit L=4 to reflect confirmed lead time and prevent under-ordering while lost-shipment risk has abated. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing a balanced base-stock given confirmed lead time and available pipeline.

Period 8 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/15 (Period 8). Recent periods show a sustained demand surge starting Period 5 (demands 268, 376, 295) after prior low-sales periods; concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (P1\u2192arrived in P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7). On-hand=0, in-transit=750 (covers several future periods). Set L via calculate to use observed lead times (avg=4). Forecast demand using recent_N (N=3) to capture the new high-demand regime (Periods 5\u20137). Use recent_N for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise target base-stock to meet elevated short-term demand while reflecting confirmed lead time, reducing stockouts given in-transit but avoiding excessive holding beyond the current high-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods based on Period 5\u20137 concludes: P1 arrived in P5, P2 in P6, P3 in P7; treat effective lead time as 4 until further concludes indicate change.

Period 9 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-22). Historical concludes show repeated zero arrivals for orders P1\u2013P4 then arrivals confirming lead_time=4 (P1 arrived in P5, P2 in P6, P3 in P7, P4 in P8). This indicates an effective lead time of 4 periods and previous apparent lost shipments were delays. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times (average of observed W=4 values). For demand forecasting I use defaults so the OR engine computes mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples), which leverages full history while the calculated L ensures pipeline coverage over the review+lead horizon and guards against underordering given delayed arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained lead-time regime = 4 periods; evidence: Period5 conclude arrived=225 (ordered P1, lead_time=4), Period6 arrived P2 lead_time=4, Period7 arrived P3 lead_time=4, Period8 arrived P4 lead_time=4.

Period 10 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:

On-hand=0, in-transit=919 (covers several future periods). Demand has been rising sharply in recent periods; to keep OR engine alignment with observed lead time and use its built-in demand estimates, set L to be calculated from observed concludes and use default mu_hat/sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across samples. This balances service (given high recent demand and long lead time) against holding cost while leveraging OR\u2019s capped ordering logic.

Period 11 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 11). Concluded history shows a sustained actual lead time of 4 periods (P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7, P4\u2192P8, P5\u2192P9, P6\u2192P10). On-hand=0, in-transit=1210 (multiple earlier orders are en route). Recent realized demand has risen sharply; last 5 concluded period demands = [376, 295, 367, 477, 468] (mean \u2248 396.6) indicating a new higher-demand regime. I therefore keep L at the promised/confirmed regime but base demand forecast and volatility on the most recent 5 periods to capture the elevated demand pattern so the OR engine sets a higher base-stock while capping orders per its cap calculation.

Carry-over insight: Sustained actual lead time = 4 periods confirmed by concludes P5\u2013P10 (orders placed P1\u2013P6 all arrived after 4 periods); treat lead time=4 until concludes indicate change.

Period 12 (2019-05-13). Recent concludes show a sustained actual lead time of 4 periods (orders placed P1\u2013P7 arrived after 4 periods); pipeline=1408, on-hand=0. Demand has increased materially since early periods (recent high-volume demands in Periods 5\u201311), so I use a lead-time estimate derived from observed concludes and emphasize recent demand for mu and sigma to capture elevated summer swimwear demand and higher variability. L set to calculate to use observed lead times (all ~4). mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N (N=6) to weight the last 6 demand observations (captures the recent high-demand regime) so the OR engine raises base-stock and safety stock appropriately to avoid stockouts given the long lead time and current large in-transit but ephemeral arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Sustained actual lead time = 4 periods confirmed by concludes P5\u2013P11 (orders placed P1\u2013P7 all arrived after 4 periods); treat lead time=4 until further concludes indicate change.

Period 13 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20 (Period 13). Recent concluded history shows actual lead time stabilized at 4 periods and in-transit = 1508; on-hand = 0. Demand has increased materially vs. early-sample seed (recent demands: 367,477,468,332,417). I set L to default (promised = 4) because concluded messages confirm a 4-period regime and promised lead time = 4. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the recent high-demand regime over the last 5 periods; mu_hat will therefore reflect (1+L)*mean of those recent samples, raising target base-stock to cover the 5-period review+lead horizon. For volatility I use recent_N (N=5) so safety stock reflects recent variability. This combination keeps the OR backend aligned with the sustained 4-period lead time and recent demand surge while avoiding dilution by older low-demand samples; it helps avoid stockouts (high profit relative to holding cost) while keeping holding exposure governed by recent variability.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27 (Period 14). Recent concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (orders placed P1\u2013P9 arrived after 4 periods). On-hand=0, in-transit=1869 \u2014 pipeline is large but arrivals occur with 4-period lag. To respect observed regime and let the OR engine compute demand coverage and safety stock using full sample history, I use the promised/default lead time and default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This keeps the backend's statistical forecasts aligned with observed 4-period lead time while letting it cap orders via its cap formula given the large pipeline.

Period 15 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/3 (Period 15). Concluded history shows a sustained actual lead time of 4 periods for orders placed P1\u2013P14; on-hand=0, in-transit=1544. Recent demand regime increased sharply starting Period 5 (summer spike): P1\u2013P4 avg demand=182.25, P5\u2013P14 avg demand=389.5. Given sustained LT=4 and the clear upward demand regime, set L to promised (confirmed 4) and forecast demand using the most recent regime to avoid understocking. Use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture current higher mean and variability; this increases target base stock to cover (1+L) periods of elevated demand while the capped order cap limits extreme overordering and controls holding cost. Carry pipeline (1544) into the OR engine which will compute base_stock and cap accordingly.

Carry-over insight: New sustained demand regime: demand rose beginning Period 5. Evidence: P1\u2013P4 mean=182.25 vs P5\u2013P14 mean=389.5 (10-period regime). Continue treating actual lead time=4 (confirmed P5\u2013P14 concludes).

Period 16 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 16 (2019/6/10). Demand has been elevated since Period 5 (sustained higher regime). On-hand=192, in-transit=1505 \u2014 pipeline is large but demand remains high; recent concludes consistently indicate actual lead time = 4 periods. To capture the recent high-demand regime I use recent_N=10 for demand estimates (covers Periods 5\u201314 regime). Use promised/default lead time (4) consistent with concluded evidence. Sigma uses the same recent_N=10 to reflect elevated volatility.

Period 17 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/17 (Period 17). Historical concludes show a sustained actual lead time = 4 periods (orders consistently arrived after 4 periods). Recent demand regime increased beginning Period 5; using recent data better captures current demand. On-hand=396 and in-transit=1352 provide large pipeline cover; using recent_N (N=10) for demand mean/volatility adapts to the higher post-change demand while L is inferred from observed concludes. These settings help the OR backend set a base-stock aligned with the confirmed 4-period lead time and the elevated recent demand, balancing service level and holding cost given high pipeline.

Historical concludes strongly confirm actual lead time = 4 periods and a sustained higher-demand regime beginning Period 5 (P5\u2013P17 mean >> earlier periods). Use promised lead time (default) since actual=promised=4 is confirmed; use recent_N for demand and volatility to capture the post-changepoint regime (use last 13 periods, P5\u2013P17) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect elevated mean and variability. This balances service (avoid stockouts during high demand) against holding cost given substantial on-hand + pipeline.

Period 19 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/1 Period19. Historical concludes show sustained actual lead time = 4 periods (orders P1\u2013P13 consistently arrived after 4); recent demand regime rose beginning Period5 (higher mean through Period14+). On-hand=0, in-transit=1628 (covers multiple future periods). To respect confirmed lead-time regime and recent higher demand, set L to promised (4) and set demand estimates using recent data to capture the elevated mean/variance. Methods chosen: L=default to use promised 4 (matches observed actual 4 in concludes); mu_hat=recent_N with N=14 to force backend to compute (1+L)*mean of last 14 samples reflecting the post-Period4 high-demand regime; sigma_hat=recent_N with N=14 to capture recent elevated volatility. These parameters increase target base-stock to avoid stockouts given sustained LT=4 and higher demand while the capped order limit still restrains extreme ordering.

Period 20 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/8 (Period 20). Concluded history shows a sustained actual lead time = 4 periods (P5\u2013P19 concludes all indicate 4). Demand increased starting Period 5 (P5\u2013P14 mean~389.5 vs P1\u2013P4 mean~182.25); recent regime persists through latest periods with high weekly demand and several large arrivals in P15\u2013P19. On-hand=0, in-transit=1721 (covers multiple future weeks). I set L to default (promised lead time=4) because concluded history confirms that regime. For forecasting I use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new higher-demand regime (use last 10 demand samples to estimate mean and volatility across the review+lead period). This balances service (higher target stock) against holding cost by reflecting elevated recent demand rather than diluting with low pre-regime observations.

Carry-over insight: Sustained actual lead time = 4 periods confirmed by concludes P5\u2013P19 (orders placed P1\u2013P15 arrived after 4 periods); New sustained demand regime began Period 5 (P5\u2013P14 mean ~389.5 vs P1\u2013P4 mean ~182.25) \u2014 use recent-sample estimates going forward.

Period 21 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-15). Historical concludes confirm a sustained actual lead time = 4 periods (orders P1\u2013P19 with concluded arrivals mostly after 4). Demand regime shifted up starting Period 5 (P5\u2013P14 mean \u2248389.5 vs P1\u2013P4 mean \u2248182), so recent higher-demand behavior should drive forecasts. On-hand=0, in-transit=2070 (large pipeline) \u2014 continue using lead time=promised(4) and estimate demand using the recent high-demand regime (last 10 periods) to size the replenishment base-stock and capture elevated demand while avoiding excessive holding cost. Chosen methods: L=default to use promised lead time (4) consistent with concluded evidence; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=10 to reflect the new sustained high-demand regime (Period 5\u201314+).

Carry-over insight: New sustained demand regime beginning Period 5: P1\u2013P4 mean=182.25 vs P5\u2013P14 mean\u2248389.5 (10-period regime). Sustained actual lead time = 4 periods confirmed by concludes P5\u2013P19.

Period 22 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-22 (Period 22). History shows consistent concludes indicating actual lead time = 4 periods (orders placed P1\u2013P17 that concluded all show lead_time=4; last conclude P21 confirms P17\u2192arrived). Demand regime shifted up beginning Period 5 (P5\u2013P21 average noticeably higher than P1\u2013P4). In-transit = 2220, on-hand = 0. I set L by calculating observed lead times to match confirmed actual L=4. For demand forecast I use recent_N over the post-changepoint regime to capture the higher mean/variance: N=17 (Periods 5\u201321) which reflects the 17-period elevated-demand regime. Using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat focuses the base-stock and safety-stock on the new higher demand while L=calculate ensures the pipeline horizon matches observed arrivals, mitigating risks from previously delayed/lost shipments.

Period 23 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29 (Period 23). Concluded history consistently shows actual lead time = 4 periods (arrivals of orders placed P1\u2013P19 all after 4 periods); use promised/default lead time. Demand shifted up beginning Period 5 (P5\u2013P14 mean \u2248389.5 vs P1\u2013P4 mean\u2248182.25); therefore use recent sample estimates to capture the higher demand regime. Choose N=10 to cover the sustained post-change regime length and stabilize estimates. These parameters give the OR backend an L that matches observed shipping behavior and mu/sigma based on the elevated recent-demand regime so orders will cover (L+1) periods of higher demand while limiting excess holding cost.

Period 24 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019/8/5). Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 5 (sustained higher weekly demand); lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history (P5\u2013P23 confirms). On-hand=267 and in-transit=1992 provide substantial pipeline cover. I set L to default (promised 4) because concluded history matches promised lead time and the OR engine expects the promised L. For demand I use recent_N with N=19 (covering the post-changepoint regime beginning Period 5 through Period 23) so mu_hat reflects the elevated mean; sigma_hat also uses recent_N N=19 to capture recent volatility. These choices align the backend base-stock calculation to the sustained higher-demand regime while relying on the confirmed L=4 so orders balance service level vs holding costs given large pipeline.

Period 25 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-08-12). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime beginning Period 5 and repeated confirms that actual lead time = promised 4 periods (concludes P5\u2013P24 show 4-period arrivals, with one lost arrival at P18 then resumed). On-hand = 793, in-transit = 1399 \u2192 pipeline + on-hand comfortably covers several periods but demand remains elevated. I set L to default (promised 4) because concluded history consistently matches promised lead time. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the sustained post-Period-5 high-demand regime (regime length \u226520 periods through Period 24); this biases forecasts and safety stock toward the higher recent mean and volatility to balance service level vs holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

Period 26 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/19 (Period 26). Historical concludes confirm sustained actual lead time = 4 periods and a higher-demand regime beginning Period 5. Current on-hand=1082, in-transit=1095 (total pipeline=2177) \u2014 ample cover vs. expected demand. Set L to default (promised=4, aligns with observed concludes). Use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained higher-demand regime identified in Periods 5\u201314; N=10 matches the 10-period regime evidence. This focuses the OR backend on the recent elevated mean/variance, balancing service level (avoid stockouts given strong recent demand) against holding cost given large current pipeline.

Period 27 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-26). On-hand=1027, in-transit=1308. Historical concludes consistently confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (orders placed P1\u2013P22 arrived after 4 periods). Demand shifted up starting Period 5 (higher sustained demand since P5). I set lead time to the promised/default (4) consistent with concluded evidence. For demand I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (regime length >20, use cap=20). I likewise set sigma_hat to recent_N N=20 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters bias the OR backend toward higher base-stock to meet elevated demand while accounting for observed lead time, balancing service vs holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

Carry-over insight: Sustained actual lead time = 4 periods confirmed by concludes P5\u2013P26 (orders placed P1\u2013P22 arrived after 4 periods); New sustained higher-demand regime began Period 5 (P1\u2013P4 mean\u2248182.25 vs P5\u2013P26 mean substantially higher) \u2014 use recent-sample estimates.

Period 28 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 28). Recent history shows consistent actual lead time = 4 periods (concludes P5\u2013P27 indicate orders placed P1\u2013P23 arrived after 4). Demand shifted up beginning Period 5 and has stayed elevated. On-hand=1657, in-transit=539 \u2192 pipeline_inventory=2196. I set L to default (promised=4, matches observed). For demand/volatility I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (changepoint at Period 5, regime length >20) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the last 20 demand samples and balance service level vs holding cost given profit=2, holding=1.

Carry-over insight: Sustained actual lead time = 4 periods confirmed by concludes P5\u2013P27 (orders placed P1\u2013P23 arrived after 4); New sustained higher-demand regime began Period 5 (use recent-sample estimates).

Demand stepped up beginning Period 5 and has been sustained. Use promised/default lead time to align with confirmed L=4. For demand forecast and variability, use recent_N with N=20 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (large sample since Period 5) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current regime and avoid being pulled by the low pre-Period-5 samples. These settings keep pipeline coverage for (1+L) periods while raising targets to meet elevated demand, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-16). Historical concludes show a sustained actual lead time = 4 periods (orders P1\u2013P25 concluded with 4-period lead). Demand regime shifted up starting Period 5; use recent-sample estimates to capture the higher post-change mean/volatility. On-hand=1740 and in-transit=347 (pipeline large vs recent demands) but policy should still target (1+L)-period coverage given confirmed L=4. Choices: L=default to use promised lead time (4) consistent with observed confirms; mu_hat=recent_N with N=20 to base the (1+L)\xd7mean on the most recent post-change samples; sigma_hat=recent_N with N=20 to reflect recent volatility. This balances service (cover higher sustained demand) while avoiding excess long-term holding since current on-hand is already high.

Period 31 (2019/9/23). Confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods from concluded history; on-hand=2023, in-transit=34 so pipeline+on-hand >> short-term demand \u2014 no urgent replenishment. Given sustained higher-demand regime since Period 5, use recent-sample forecast to capture elevated mean demand while relying on OR's lead-time assumption. Choose L=default to match promised lead time=4 (consistent with observed concludes), mu_hat=recent_N with N=5 to focus the estimate on the recent higher-demand regime, and sigma_hat=default so backend computes volatility over full samples scaled by sqrt(1+L). These settings keep orders conservative (avoid overstock given high current on-hand) while aligning the forecast with the sustained higher-demand regime.

Period 32 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:

Demand shifted up beginning Period 5 (P1\u2013P4 mean ~182 vs P5+ substantially higher); use recent-sample estimates reflecting the post-change regime. Set L by calculating observed lead times to lock to the confirmed 4-period regime. For mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=20 (regime length >>20) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and variability from the current high-demand regime; this balances higher service needs while avoiding excess inventory since on-hand is already high (on-hand=1988, in-transit=34) and lost shipments are not currently observed.

Period 33 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-07 (Period 33). History of conclude messages consistently shows actual lead time = 4 periods (P5\u2013P32 concludes); earlier prolonged no-arrival episodes resolved into a sustained L=4 regime. Demand shifted up starting Period 5 (sustained higher-demand regime). On-hand = 1940, in-transit = 20 \u2192 ample on-hand now but future orders must reflect higher recent demand and confirmed L=4. Set L to default (promised = 4) matching observed actual lead time. Use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-change, higher-demand regime (use the last 20 demand samples to estimate (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR engine replenishes to a base stock appropriate for the sustained higher demand while avoiding excessive reliance on stale low-demand data. This also mitigates risk from earlier lost shipments by relying on observed concludes rather than assuming shorter lead times.

Period 34 (2019-10-14). On-hand=1922, in-transit=0. Concluded history shows a sustained actual lead time of 4 periods (orders placed P1\u2013P29 concluded with lead_time=4); no recent missing-shipment signal. Demand shifted up starting Period 5 and the recent regime is best represented by the last 20 demand observations. To balance service and holding cost given high on-hand, use inferred L from observed concludes and recent-sample estimates for forecast and volatility (N=20) so the OR engine's base-stock is driven by recent elevated demand while respecting the confirmed lead time.

Carry-over insight: Sustained actual lead time = 4 periods confirmed by concludes P5\u2013P33; New sustained higher-demand regime beginning Period 5 (use recent samples for forecasts).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-21). On-hand=1879, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show a sustained actual lead time = 4 periods (orders placed P1\u2013P30 consistently arrived after 4 periods). Demand shifted higher beginning Period 5 and has remained elevated; to capture the current regime I use recent-sample estimates. With high on-hand and no pipeline, we avoid aggressive ordering; using recent_N (N=20) for mu and sigma incorporates the last 20 demand observations (recent higher-demand regime) while L=default (promised=4, matches observed). This balances service (covering lead+review period demand) against holding cost given large on-hand inventory.

Period 38 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 38). Recent observed lead times are consistently 4 periods (concludes P5\u2013P37); use promised/default lead time. On-hand=1759, in-transit=0 \u2014 current inventory substantially exceeds recent demand, so forecast using the recent low-demand regime. Demand has fallen since ~Period 31; last 5 demands = [38,43,50,36,34] -> mean ~40.2. To keep service while limiting holding cost, use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so OR backend sizes base stock to the current low-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Sustained actual lead time = 4 periods confirmed P5\u2013P37; New low-demand regime began \u2248 Period 31 (recent 5-period mean \u224840 units/week).

Period 39 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-18). Historical concludes show sustained actual lead time = 4 periods; recent demand has shifted down starting ~Period 31 (recent weeks average ~43 units). On-hand = 1717, in-transit = 0. Set L to promised (4) consistent with sustained concludes. Use recent_N (most recent low-demand regime) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect lower demand (N=8 covers Periods 31\u201338). This biases orders down to limit holding cost while maintaining service for the current low-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: New low-demand regime began \u2248 Period 31 (Periods 31\u201338 mean \u224843 units/week); sustained actual lead time = 4 periods confirmed by concludes through Period 38.

Period 40 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 40). Demand has declined since ~Period 31 (recent weekly demands: P31\u2013P39 = [35,62,38,43,50,36,34,42,17]) indicating a new low-demand regime. On-hand=1700, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample inventory now; no overdue in-transit. Historical concludes confirm sustained actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple concludes P5\u2013P39 show 4-period arrivals). I set L to default (promised lead time = 4) since actual lead time is stable at 4 and backend expects promised L. For forecasting I use recent_N demand estimates to capture the new low-demand regime (changepoint \u2248 Period 31, regime length 9 periods P31\u2013P39). Using recent_N (N=9) for mu_hat and sigma_hat yields (1+L)-scaled mean and sqrt(1+L)-scaled std based on the 9 most recent demands, which prevents over-ordering given current low demand and high on-hand inventory while preserving service given stable lead time.

Carry-over insight: New low-demand regime began \u2248 Period 31 (Periods 31\u201339 mean \u224840 units/week); sustained actual lead time = 4 periods confirmed by concludes through Period 39.

Period 41 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 41). History shows sustained actual lead time = 4 periods (concludes P5\u2013P40 confirm orders arriving 4 periods after ordering). Recent demand has fallen to a low regime beginning \u2248Period 31 (Periods 31\u201340 demands = [35,62,38,43,50,36,34,42,17,113], mean \u224847). On-hand = 1587, in-transit = 0; with high on-hand relative to current demand, we should size forecasts to the new low-demand regime and use observed lead time=4. Selected methods: infer L from observed concludes (calculate), use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the identified low-demand regime (N=10) so the OR engine targets inventory for the new lower demand while preserving the confirmed lead time.

Carry-over insight: Sustained actual lead time = 4 periods confirmed by concludes through Period 40; New low-demand regime began \u2248 Period 31 (Periods 31\u201340 mean \u224847 units/week).

Period 42 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/9 (Period 42). On-hand=1536, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show a sustained actual lead time =4 periods (orders placed P1\u2013P37 consistently arrived after 4 periods). Demand has fallen to a low regime beginning ~Period 31 (recent weekly demands \u224830\u2013113, recent mean \u224840\u201350). Given very high on-hand inventory vs current low demand, place no aggressive replenishment: use promised/default lead time and default demand/volatility estimates so the OR engine will likely order zero (pipeline + on-hand already exceeds calculated base stock). This minimizes holding cost while preserving service under confirmed L=4.

Carry-over insight: Sustained actual lead time = 4 periods (conclude evidence P5\u2013P41: orders placed P1\u2013P37 arrived after 4 periods); New low-demand regime began \u2248Period 31 (Periods 31\u201341 recent mean \u224840\u201350 units/week).

Period 43 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/16 (Period 43). Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (orders from P1+ arriving after 4); recent demand regime shifted down starting ~P31 with low weekly demand (~40\u201350 units). Current on-hand=1479, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample cover vs recent demand, avoid large replenishment. Set L to promised (use default=4). Forecast demand across review+lead using recent regime (Periods 31\u201342) to avoid inflating mu from earlier high-demand periods: use recent_N with N=12. Use recent_N N=12 for sigma to capture recent low-volatility regime. These parameters align the backend base-stock to deliver service with lower holding risk given high on-hand and confirmed LT=4.

Carry-over insight: Sustained actual lead time = 4 periods confirmed by concludes through Period 42; New low-demand regime began \u2248 Period 31 (Periods 31\u201342 mean \u224840\u201350 units/week).

Period 44 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (Period 44). Concluded history shows sustained actual lead time = 4 periods (consistent concludes P5\u2013P43). Demand has shifted to a lower regime beginning ~Period 31; recent periods 31\u201343 mean \u224849 units/week. I set L to the promised/default (4) consistent with concluded evidence. I use recent_N (N=13, Periods 31\u201343) for mu_hat to capture the new low-demand regime across the review+lead window (1+L=5) and recent_N (N=13) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep target base-stock aligned to current low demand while preserving service given observed 4-period lead time and large on-hand balance.
