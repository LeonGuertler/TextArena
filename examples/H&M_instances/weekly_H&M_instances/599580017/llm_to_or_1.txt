Period 1 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. SKU 599580017 has on-hand=0 and in-transit=0; no 'conclude' arrival history to infer actual lead time. Historical demands = [61,98,152,129,213], mean=130.6 units. Promised lead time = 4 periods; with no evidence to the contrary use default lead time. Use default demand/volatility methods so backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This provides a stable base-stock anchor (covers L+1 periods) while avoiding overreaction to limited history and potential lost shipments.

Period 2 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04 (Period 2). No concluded arrivals yet (Period 1 conclude: ordered=225 arrived=0) so we have no evidence actual lead time differs from promised. On-hand=0, in-transit=225 but that in-transit is insufficient vs. expected demand over review+lead. Use promised lead time and population demand stats: base forecast should use all 5 historical samples (mean=130.6) and volatility from all samples (std\u224851.3). Choosing default methods keeps the OR engine calibrated to the full-sample mean/variance while acknowledging the outstanding in-transit 225 may still arrive on the promised schedule.

Period 3 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 3). On-hand=0, In-transit=453 (orders from P1/P2). No concluded arrivals yet, so no evidence actual lead time differs from promised 4. Historical demand samples = [61,98,152,129,213], mean ~130.6. Promised lead time remains appropriate; use default forecasting (use all samples) so OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std. This keeps parameters consistent with observed demand and avoids overreacting to shipments that are still within promised lead time window.

Period 4 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/18 (Period 4). Product is seasonal swimwear; recent observed demands (history) seed forecast. Three consecutive conclude messages show orders placed in Periods 1\u20133 but arrived=0 \u2192 possible delayed or lost shipments; in-transit shows 681 units (undelivered). No concluded arrivals exist to compute actual lead time, so use promised lead time. Use default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean, sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR backend applies its service-level math given promised L=4. This keeps parameters conservative (covers L+1 periods) while avoiding overfitting to transient missing arrivals; if arrivals remain absent, switch to explicit L later.

Carry-over insight: Possible shipment delays/loss: orders placed in Periods 1\u20133 have not concluded (arrived=0) despite in-transit=681; monitor for lost shipments and revise lead-time estimate if no concludes by Period 7.

Period 5 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period=2019-03-25. Recent on-hand=0, in-transit=787 but no concluded arrivals in Periods1-4 \u2192 evidence of delayed/lost shipments. Recent realized demand is elevated and rising (period demands: 175,173,181,200). To avoid stockouts while acknowledging possible extended fulfillment, I set lead time explicitly longer than promised. I use recent_N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base forecast on the four most recent high-demand periods so the base-stock covers current demand regime. This balances service (cover higher recent demand) vs holding cost given risk of delayed/lost arrivals.

Period 6 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-04-01): recent conclude shows arrival=225 (ordered Period 1) with observed lead_time=4, matching promised lead time. In-transit=765 equals orders placed in Periods 2\u20135 (228+228+106+203), so no evidence of lost shipments yet. Demand context: swimwear category in late Mar/early Apr (approaching spring)\u2014elevated demand recently (history shows higher recent samples). Given confirmed lead time=4 and limited data for regime shifts, use default estimators so the OR engine applies promised lead time and full-sample demand stats; this balances service (avoid stockouts during season uptrend) versus holding cost conservatively while we monitor future concludes for any lost shipments or lead-time changes.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (evidence: Period 5 conclude: arrived=225 ordered on Period 1, lead_time was 4).

Period 7 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period=7 (2019-04-08). Recent concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (Period 5 conclude: arrival from Period 1 lead_time=4; Period 6 conclude: arrival from Period 2 lead_time=4). On-hand=0, in-transit=654; prior multi-period non-concludes resolved into 4-period arrivals. Use promised/default lead time and default demand estimates so OR backend applies (1+L) scaling over the full sample set; this is conservative given confirmed L=4 and recent high demand spikes (Periods 5-6). Default sigma to let backend compute volatility from all samples.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (evidence: Period 5 conclude: arrived=225 ordered on Period 1, lead_time=4; Period 6 conclude: arrived=228 ordered on Period 2, lead_time=4). Previous suspected lost shipments now resolved.

Period 8 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-15). On-hand=0, in-transit=750. Recent Period 5\u20137 concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 (arrived=225 from P1, arrived=228 from P2, arrived=228 from P3; lead_time=4). Pipeline appears healthy (750 units) but demand has been high recent periods; to be conservative use inferred lead time from observed concludes and let OR backend compute demand-over-review+lead using historical samples. Chosen methods: L by calculate to use observed lead times average; mu_hat and sigma_hat default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (evidence: Period 5 conclude: arrived=225 ordered on Period 1, lead_time=4; Period 6 conclude: arrived=228 ordered on Period 2, lead_time=4; Period 7 conclude: arrived=228 ordered on Period 3, lead_time=4).

Period 9 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019/4/22): on-hand=0, in-transit=945. Concluded history confirms actual lead time = 4 periods (arrivals from orders placed in Periods 1\u20134 all showed lead_time=4). Demand has shifted sharply higher in recent periods (last 5 period demands: 200, 268, 376, 295, 367) indicating a new high-demand regime (likely swim season). I set L to promised (default) since concluded evidence matches promised lead time. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine's base-stock and cap reflect the elevated mean and volatility observed in the last 5 periods. This keeps orders responsive to current high demand while the confirmed L=4 avoids over/understating pipeline duration. On-hand+pipeline (945 units) currently covers several periods of elevated demand but parameters will target replenishment for sustained high demand.

Period 10 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-29). Recent conclues (Periods 5-9) consistently show arrivals from orders placed 4 periods earlier \u2192 confirmed actual lead time = 4. On-hand=0, in-transit=1164 (pipeline large and matches the expected 4-period lead behavior). Demand has been volatile and elevated recently (conclude demands: 268,376,295,367,477), so keep safety via OR defaults that use full sample history and promised lead time. Use default L (promised=4) since observed lead time matches promise; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting the OR engine set base-stock and cap given observed variability. This balances service (high recent demand) against holding cost given large in-transit inventory and confirmed lead time.

Period 11 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-05-06). On-hand=0, in-transit=1127. Concluded arrivals in Periods 5\u201310 consistently show orders placed earlier arriving with lead_time=4 (evidence: Period 5\u201310 conclude messages). Use L=calculate to lock to observed average lead time (4). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history; this is conservative and leverages the engine's forecasting while aligning lead-time with observed arrivals. Pipeline (1127) currently provides coverage for multiple periods, reducing urgency to inflate mu_hat.

Period 12 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-05-13). Recent concluded history consistently shows actual lead time = 4 periods and very high demand each period leaving on-hand = 0. On-hand=0, in-transit=1012 \u2014 pipeline large relative to per-period demand but arrivals are delayed by the 4-period lead time. To let the OR engine use its standard estimation and given confirmed LT=4, I keep L at the promised/default so backend uses promised lead time; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This is conservative: relies on full-sample demand stats while the large in-transit cushion avoids stockouts short-term. If future concludes show lost shipments or a regime shift in demand, switch to recent_N or explicit forecasts.

Period 13 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/20 (Period 13). On-hand=0, in-transit=1061. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4 (Periods 5\u201312 concludes all attribute arrivals to orders placed 4 periods earlier). No evidence of recent lost shipments. Use promised/confirmed lead time and default demand estimates so OR backend applies full-sample mean/variance over the (1+L) review+lead horizon and caps orders appropriately given large pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (evidence: concluded arrivals in Periods 5\u201312 attribute orders placed in Periods 1\u20138 to lead_time=4).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/27 (Period 14). On-hand=52, in-transit=992. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (orders from Periods 1\u20139 concluded with lead_time=4), so use the promised/default lead time. No recent lost-shipment signal remains. I choose default demand/volatility methods so the OR backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over all samples to produce a base-stock that balances service (profit $2 vs holding $1) and avoids overstock risk given large in-transit volume.

Period 15 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-06-03). Recent concluded history consistently shows actual lead time = 4 periods (Period 5\u201314 conclude entries attribute orders placed in Periods 1\u201310 to lead_time=4). On-hand=0, in-transit=1312 (pipeline robust). Demand regime has shifted up since Period 5 (many demands in 200\u2013525 range vs initial small samples). To capture elevated recent demand I use a recent_N forecast (focus on last 5 demand observations) and estimate volatility from the same window. Lead time set to calculated average of observed lead times (confirmed =4) so pipeline coverage uses correct L. These choices raise the base-stock to meet higher short-term demand while sigma_hat driven by recent variability keeps safety stock appropriate; relying on recent data avoids underordering given persistent high demand and resolved past shipment anomalies.

I use the default lead-time and demand estimators so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all historical samples; this is conservative given large pipeline and verified L=4, and lets the OR engine balance service level vs holding cost without over-reacting to recent variability.

Period 17 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-17 (Period 17). Recent concluded history consistently shows actual lead time = 4 periods; on-hand=48, in-transit=1302 (pipeline large). Use promised/default lead time to match confirmed 4. Demand samples seeding forecasts are limited; use backend defaults so OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, which prudently scales safety stock with lead time and observed variability. This avoids overreacting to recent high orders while the large in-transit pipeline already covers multiple periods.

Period 18 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-24). Historical concluded lead times repeatedly show actual L=4; recent arrival pattern resolves earlier suspected losses. Demand samples (seed) mean \u2248130.6 units; (1+L)=5 \u2192 5\xd7mean \u2248653 units. Current on-hand=0, in-transit=1133 > 653 so pipeline comfortably covers (L+1) periods. Use default lead time and default demand moments so OR backend uses full-sample mean/std scaled by (1+L); this is conservative given confirmed L=4 and ample pipeline, avoids overreacting to recent volatility while keeping service level.

Period 19 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-07-01). Recent concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (arrivals in Periods 5\u201318 map to orders placed 4 periods earlier). On-hand=0, in-transit=1194 \u2014 pipeline covers multiple future periods but arrivals are unseen until next conclude. Demand has been high and variable; to balance $2 profit vs $1 holding, use the backend's default estimates anchored to promised lead time (4) so OR engine applies its base-stock calculation with full historical pooling and default volatility. This is conservative given confirmed L=4 and substantial in-transit inventory.

Period 20 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-07-08). Product is swimwear in peak summer \u2014 demand historically high. On-hand=0, in-transit=1178 which exceeds the default (1+L) demand estimate (mu_hat=5\xd7mean of historical samples = 653 units), so pipeline is sufficient for the upcoming review+lead window. Recent concluded history consistently shows actual lead time = 4 periods; no lost shipments outstanding. I therefore use the promised/default lead time to align with observed lead-time evidence and leave demand/volatility estimates at default (all-sample) to avoid overfitting to short-term spikes. This balances service (avoid stockouts in peak season) against holding cost by relying on in-transit cover and conservative default safety stock.

Period 21 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-15). Recent concluded history consistently shows actual lead time = 4 periods. On-hand=0, in-transit=1789 \u2014 pipeline is large and should cover demand over the next (1+L) periods. Last concluded period (20) shows arrival=0 for order placed in Period 16 but prior cadence indicates arrivals reliably after 4 periods; no strong evidence of a new regime in demand variance or mean. To remain consistent with observed lead time and stable demand signals, use default lead time (promised), and default demand mean/volatility calculations so the OR backend computes base-stock and cap from full historical samples. This balances service (high pipeline) against holding cost without overreacting to one zero-arrival conclude.

Date 2019/8/12 (Period 25). Recent conclude history consistently shows actual lead time = 4 periods. Current inventory: on-hand=659, in-transit=1102 \u2014 pipeline+on-hand (1761) comfortably covers (L+1) periods of demand at typical demand levels. I therefore use the promised/default lead time (4) and default demand estimates so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history; this balances service (confirmed L=4, high recent demand variability) against holding cost given holding=$1 and profit=$2.

Period 26 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-19). Swimwear in peak summer season; recent history shows repeated confirmations that actual lead time = 4 periods (concluded arrivals consistently attribute orders placed 4 periods earlier). Current inventory: on-hand=574, in-transit=1201 \u2014 ample pipeline but demand has been volatile with several large spikes. Given multiple concluded lead-time observations and no evidence of lost shipments since Period 5\u201313 confirmations, use the promised/default lead time. Use default demand aggregations so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the historical samples; this balances service level (profit $2 vs holding $1) without overfitting to recent spikes and leverages the confirmed L=4.

Historical conclude messages consistently confirm actual lead time = 4 periods. Current on-hand=1038 and in-transit=665 \u2014 ample coverage vs. recent demand; no unresolved lost shipments.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-1370.00

Period 38 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-11-11). On-hand=1438, in-transit=50 \u2014 ample coverage. Concluded history consistently confirms actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple concluded arrivals mapping orders to lead_time=4). No new lost-shipment signal. To avoid overreacting and let the OR engine use full historical demand stats, use default lead time and default demand/volatility estimates so ordering is driven by the backend's (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std calculations given confirmed L=4.

Period 39 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-18). SKU is seasonal swimwear; recent confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (consistent concluded arrivals). On-hand=1402, in-transit=51; pipeline + on-hand well above recent weekly demands. Use promised/default lead time and default demand/volatility aggregation so backend uses all historical samples to set base-stock. This is conservative given stable revealed L=4 and avoids overreacting to short recent demand dips in late-season.

Period 40 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-25). Recent concluded history consistently shows actual lead time = 4 periods. On-hand=1398 plus in-transit=55 is high relative to recent weekly demand (mostly ~30\u201350 units), so avoid inflating forecasts. Use promised lead time (4) and default demand/volatility calculations so OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full samples; this leverages long-run data while respecting observed stable L=4 and prevents over-ordering given current high on-hand.

Period 41 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-12-02). On-hand=1308, in-transit=32. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (Period 5\u201340 conclude messages attribute arrivals to orders placed 4 periods earlier). Recent history shows demand regime declined from mid-year peaks to low steady weekly demand; no new lost-shipment evidence. Use promised/default lead time to match observed stable L=4. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample [61,98,152,129,213], balancing service level vs holding cost given current high on-hand inventory and low in-transit.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-12-09). On-hand=1265, in-transit=111. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods. No new lost-shipment evidence; pipeline modest relative to on-hand. Use promised/default lead time and default demand/volatility aggregation so OR backend applies (1+L) scaling to full sample mean/std\u2014this keeps policy aligned with observed LT=4 and balances service vs holding given high on-hand.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-16). On-hand=1215, in-transit=134. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods; no outstanding lost shipments. To keep policy aligned with observed lead time and stable demand samples, use default lead time (promised=4) and default demand/volatility aggregation so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from available samples. This keeps service level high while avoiding unnecessary extra inventory given large on-hand balance.

Period 45 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-30). On-hand=1117, in-transit=193. Historical conclude messages consistently confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple concluded arrivals attributing orders to lead_time=4 across Periods 5\u201344). Recent history shows high on-hand relative to demand, so avoid aggressive replenishment. I choose default for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat so the OR backend uses promised lead time (4) and full-sample demand statistics to compute base-stock and caps; this leverages the confirmed LT=4 signal while keeping ordering conservative given elevated inventory and holding cost.
