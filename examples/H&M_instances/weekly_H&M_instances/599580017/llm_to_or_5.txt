Period 1 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. SKU is seasonal swimwear (demand likely rising into spring); on-hand=0, in-transit=0, no concluded arrivals to suggest lead-time deviations. Historical demands = [61,98,152,129,213] (mean=130.6, std\u224857.4). Use promised lead time (default) L=2 because no concluded arrivals to infer a different regime. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample\u2014this balances service level for upcoming seasonal uplift while avoiding overreacting to limited history or potential lost shipments.

Period 2 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/4 (Period 2). Recent demand history [61,98,152,129,213] has mean 130.6 and std ~51.3. On-hand=0, in-transit=225 (order placed Period 1); Period 1 conclude showed arrived=0 for that order which is expected given promised lead time=2 (no concluded arrivals yet). No evidence of lost shipments or lead-time change, so use default promised lead time and default demand aggregation across the full sample to let the OR backend compute base stock. This balances service (cover (1+L) periods of demand) against holding cost conservatively while we wait for future conclude messages to infer any lead-time shifts.

Period 3 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/11. On-hand=52, in-transit=228. Historical baseline demands = [61,98,152,129,213] but recent concluded periods show very high realized demand (~175,173) and the Period 1->2 arrival indicates actual observed lead_time=1 (earlier than promised). I set L to 'calculate' so the OR backend uses observed lead times (captures the 1-period realized lead time). Demand appears to have shifted up vs. long-run samples, so I use EWMA_gamma with gamma=0.5 for mu_hat to bias the (1+L)-period demand forecast toward recent high demand while still retaining historical weight. For sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=5 to reflect volatility across all available samples including recent spikes. These choices raise the computed base-stock to improve service during the higher-demand regime while letting the backend cap orders to limit excess inventory given holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand uptick: recent concluded demands (175,173) exceed historical mean (~130.6), indicating a sustained higher-demand regime; observed lead_time=1 period (ordered Period 1 arrived Period 2), lower than promised 2-period lead time.

Period 4 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/18. Recent concluded demands (Periods 1-3: 175, 173, 181) show a sustained demand uptick vs historical samples; observed concluded lead_time=1 (Period1 order arrived in Period2). On-hand=0, in-transit=314 (covers some upcoming demand but we must plan for higher demand). I set L by calculate to use observed lead times (average\u21921). For demand I use recent_N N=3 to capture the new, higher-demand regime (mu_hat based on last 3 demands across review+lead). For sigma_hat I also use recent_N N=3 so safety stock reflects recent volatility. These choices raise target base-stock to meet the higher short-term demand while using recent volatility to avoid excessive holding given holding cost=$1/unit.

Period 5 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date=2019-03-25 P5. Recent demand regime is materially higher (recent demands 175,173,181,200 vs historical mean ~130.6). One concluded arrival shows actual lead_time=1 (Period2 arrived from Period1). Multiple subsequent orders have not concluded and likely lost/in-transit; pipeline shows 356 units but arrivals uncertain. To capture the sustained higher-demand regime I use recent_N=4 for demand estimates (covers the four most recent high-demand samples) and match the observed faster lead time explicitly L=1 so the OR backend sizes base_stock over the correct horizon. Using recent_N for sigma captures elevated variability seen in the last four periods. These choices raise target stock to protect service level given higher demand while keeping holding risk tied to observed volatility; explicit L=1 also avoids over-ordering that would occur if using the promised 2-period lead time.

Period 6 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/1 (Period 6). Recent periods show a sustained uptick in demand (last 5 demands = 175,173,181,200,268; mean=199.4) and volatile arrivals: observed lead_times = [1 (P1\u2192P2), 3 (P2\u2192P5)]. On-hand=0, in-transit=144 (some in-transit from prior orders). To balance higher demand vs holding cost, set L to the average observed lead time so mu_hat and sigma_hat scale by (1+L) appropriately while using recent data (last 5) to capture the new higher-demand regime. This increases target base-stock to avoid stockouts while keeping volatility accounted for.

Carry-over insight: Higher-demand regime confirmed: last 5 demands mean=199.4 (periods 1-5). Observed lead-time variability: observed lead_times {1,3}, average=2.

Period 7 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/8. Recent demand has shifted sharply upward (periods 1-5 mean=199.4) with large spike in Period 6 (376). On-hand=0, in-transit=281 (some in-transit orders are delayed or staggered). Observed concluded lead_times = {1,3,3,2} \u2192 average ~2.25, showing variability and occasional longer delays than promised. To capture the sustained higher-demand regime while letting the OR engine infer average lead time from observations, set L to 'calculate' (use observed lead times). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to base the review+lead demand mean and volatility on the last 5 high-demand samples so base-stock rises to meet the new regime and account for increased variability; this also mitigates stockouts from delayed arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Higher-demand regime persists: last 5 demands mean=199.4; observed lead_time values {1,3,3,2}, average\u22482.25 (greater variability than promised L=2).

Period 8 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15 (Period 8). Recent demand has shifted up sharply: last 5 demands (Periods 3-7) average 264 units, well above historical mean. On-hand=0, in-transit=531 (multiple past orders in pipeline). Concluded lead-time observations = {1,3,3,2} \u2192 average \u22482.25, showing greater variability and occasional longer-than-promised delays. To capture the empirically observed lead-time regime I request L by 'calculate' so backend uses the observed average. To reflect the sustained higher-demand regime use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat (captures the elevated mean over the last 5 periods). Volatility has increased with the same recent samples, so set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=5) to reflect current variability. These choices increase base-stock to meet higher demand while accounting for observed lead-time variability and avoid under-ordering given in-transit pipeline and past lost/delayed arrivals.

Period 9 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019/4/22): on-hand=0, in-transit=576. Recent concluded lead_times = {1,3,3,2} (avg=2.25) showing greater variability than promised L=2 and some multi-period delays; several orders experienced >2-period lead times and some arrivals delayed. Demand has stepped up sharply: recent demands (periods 4-8) = [200,268,376,295,367], last-5 mean=301.2, indicating an elevated-demand regime vs earlier periods. To balance service vs holding cost: set L by averaging recent observed lead times to capture increased variability (recent_N, N=4). Set mu_hat using recent demand (recent_N, N=5) to reflect the new higher-demand regime across the review+lead period. Set sigma_hat using recent demand variability (recent_N, N=5) so safety stock reflects current volatility. These choices ensure the backend increases target base-stock to cover the higher demand and wider lead-time uncertainty while capping orders per its policy.

Carry-over insight: NEW: Demand has further accelerated \u2014 last 5 demands (periods 4\u20138) mean=301.2, evidence of a higher, sustained demand regime; NEW: Observed lead_time variability increased with observed lead_times {1,3,3,2}, average\u22482.25, indicating actual lead time often \u2265 promised and more volatile.

Period 10 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 10). Recent demands have accelerated sharply: last 5 demands (Periods 5-9) = [268,376,295,367,477], mean=356.6, well above earlier regime. Arrival history shows variable actual lead times (observed values: 1,3,3,2,3,1) with average \u22482.17 and volatility; some shipments arrive late and some early versus promised L=2. To capture the faster demand, I use a recent_N forecast for mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 5 periods. For lead time I choose the calculated average of observed lead times so the OR engine inflates pipeline coverage to reflect realized variability and reduces stockouts due to lost/late shipments. This balances higher service needs (higher \u03bc\u0302) against holding cost by letting the backend compute target base_stock with the updated L and recent demand statistics.

Carry-over insight: NEW: Demand regime shifted up \u2014 last 5 demands (Periods 5\u20139) mean=356.6 indicating sustained higher demand; NEW: Actual lead time more variable and on average \u22482.17 (observed lead_times {1,3,3,2,3,1}), so shipments often deviate from promised L=2.

Period 11 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 11). Recent history shows a clear upward demand regime: last 5 demands (Periods 5\u20139) average ~356.6 units, well above historical mean. Observed lead-times from concluded arrivals = {1,3,3,2,3,1,3}, average \u22482.29 and variable; shipments often deviate from promised L=2. To protect service during this higher-demand regime while accounting for volatile/longer actual lead times, set L to the observed-average (calculate) and use recent_N=5 for demand mean/volatility so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the new regime (Periods 5\u20139). This increases target base-stock to meet elevated demand while sigma_hat from recent_N captures current variability; using observed-average L addresses frequent lead-time extensions and reduces risk of stockouts given in-transit inventory of 513 but zero on-hand.

Carry-over insight: NEW: Demand regime shifted up \u2014 last 5 demands (Periods 5\u20139) mean=356.6, sustained higher demand; NEW: Actual lead time is more variable and longer than promised (observed lead_times {1,3,3,2,3,1,3}, average\u22482.29).

Period 12 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/13. Demand has accelerated sharply: last 5 realized demands (Periods 7\u201311 = 295,367,477,468,332) mean=387.8, well above earlier regime. On-hand=0, in-transit=769 (pipeline large but arrivals have been volatile). Observed concluded lead_times = {1,3,3,2,3,1,3,2} (avg\u22482.25) \u2014 higher and more variable than promised L=2, causing late and lumpy arrivals. I set L="calculate" to let the backend use the average of observed lead times (captures \u22482.25). For demand I use mu_hat="recent_N" with N=5 to target the new high-demand regime ((1+L)*mean of last 5 demands). For sigma_hat I use recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility and widen safety stock. These choices prioritize service during a clear upward demand shift while accounting for increased lead-time variability and existing large but uncertain pipeline.

Carry-over insight: NEW: Sustained higher-demand regime \u2014 last 5 demands (Periods 7\u201311) mean=387.8 vs historical mean\u2248130\u2013200; NEW: Actual lead time avg\u22482.25 with high variability (observed lead_times {1,3,3,2,3,1,3,2}), shipments often arrive later than promised L=2.

Period 13 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-20). On-hand=0, in-transit=826. Recent history shows a sustained upward demand regime: recent demands (Periods 8-12 = 367,477,468,332,417) average 412.2, well above the long-run historical mean. Concluded arrivals show volatile actual lead times (observed lead_times from concludes: 1,3,3,2,3,1,3,2) averaging >2 with high variance and occasional 3-period delays. To capture the higher demand while letting the OR engine infer lead-time bias from observed concludes, I request: L via calculate (use observed lead times average), mu_hat based on the most recent 5 periods to reflect the new higher-demand regime, and sigma_hat based on the same recent 5 periods to capture increased volatility. This increases target base-stock to meet elevated demand while letting the capped order cap limit excessive single-period receipts; using recent data addresses the regime shift and the calculate L acknowledges lead-time variability and probable delays (mitigating lost-sales risk given zero on-hand).

Carry-over insight: Sustained higher-demand regime confirmed: recent 5-period mean (Periods 8-12) = 412.2 vs historical ~130\u2013200; Actual lead time is variable and frequently >=2 (observed lead_times {1,3,3,2,3,1,3,2}, avg>2), indicating shipments often arrive later than promised.

Period 14 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27 (Period 14). On-hand=0, in-transit=863. Recent history shows a sustained step-up in demand (recent 5-period mean >> historical) and highly variable actual lead times with many arrivals later than promised. To capture elevated demand I set mu_hat using a recent-5 sample average (covers review+lead demand). To reflect volatile demand dispersion use sigma_hat from the same recent-5 window. For lead time I use recent_N over all observed lead-time samples (N=8) to reflect the empirically observed, frequently \u22652 lead time and its variability; this helps the OR engine size pipeline targets upward to avoid stockouts given overdue shipments.

Carry-over insight: Sustained higher-demand regime: recent 5-period mean demand = 412.8 (Periods 9\u201313); Actual lead time is variable and often \u22652 with observed lead_times {1,3,3,2,3,1,3,2}, average \u22482.25 \u2014 shipments frequently deviate from promised L=2.

Period 15 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03 (Period 15). Recent demand has accelerated and stabilized well above historical levels: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 10\u201314) mean=422.4 vs historical mean ~130\u2013200. Observed concluded lead_times across history are variable and often >=2 with recent volatility; using a recent average better captures late or variable shipments. Therefore set L using recent_N to reflect recent actual lead-time behavior; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (last 5 demands) to capture the new higher-demand regime and increased volatility. This increases target base stock to reduce stockouts given frequent late arrivals while letting OR backend cap orders.

Carry-over insight: Sustained higher-demand regime: recent 5-period mean (Periods 10\u201314)=422.4 (evidence: demands 468,332,417,370,525). Actual lead time is variable and often >=2 with recent concluded lead_times averaging >2 (shipments frequently arrive later than promised L=2).

Period 16 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10 (Period 16). Recent demand has shifted to a higher regime: last 5 demands = [332,417,370,525,330] (mean\u2248394.8) vs historical mean\u2248130\u2013200. Shipments have been highly variable with many arrivals after the promised L=2 (observed lead_times average >2). To capture elevated demand while letting the OR engine infer empirical lead time from observed concludes, set L to 'calculate' (use average of observed lead times). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to focus the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility on the current higher-demand regime. This reduces stockouts from sustained uplift while avoiding overstating long-term variance from older low-demand periods.

Carry-over insight: NEW: Sustained higher-demand regime confirmed \u2014 recent 5-period mean demand (Periods 11\u201315) = 394.8 (demands 332,417,370,525,330). NEW: Actual lead time is variable and often >= promised L=2 (multiple concluded lead_times >2), implying shipments frequently arrive later than promised.

Period 17 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-17). Recent demand has shifted to a higher regime: last 5 demands (Periods 12\u201316) = [417,370,525,330,302], mean\u2248388.8 vs historical mean\u2248130\u2013200. On-hand=0, in-transit=892 (large pipeline) but past concludes show variable/out-of-promised arrivals. Observed concluded lead_times = [1,3,3,2,3,1,3,2,3,1] (avg\u22482.2) so actual lead time is often \u2265 promised 2 and volatile. I set L="calculate" so backend uses the average observed lead time (captures shipments often late). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N with N=5 to reflect the new higher-demand regime (use last 5 demands for (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility), which raises target base-stock and increases safety stock to protect service while acknowledging pipeline already large. This balances higher service needs against holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory.

Carry-over insight: Sustained higher-demand regime confirmed: recent 5-period mean (Periods 12\u201316)=388.8 vs historical ~130\u2013200; Actual lead time is variable and on average \u22482.2 (observed concluded lead_times {1,3,3,2,3,1,3,2,3,1}), indicating shipments often arrive later than promised L=2.

Period 18 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/24 Period 18. On-hand=0, in-transit=891. Recent demand has shifted to a sustained high regime: last 5 demands (Periods 13\u201317) = {370,525,330,302,517}, mean=408.8. Concluded arrivals show variable, often-late shipments: observed lead_times={1,3,3,2,3,1,3,2,3,1,3}, avg\u22482.27, exceeding promised L=2 and implying persistent delivery volatility (lost/late shipments). I set L explicit to 2.27 to reflect measured average lead time so the OR engine inflates pipeline coverage for late arrivals. I set mu_hat recent_N N=5 to capture the new high-demand regime over the last 5 periods (gives (1+L)*recent mean demand). I set sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to reflect recent demand volatility. These choices increase target base stock to meet elevated demand while accounting for observed lead-time slippage and variability, reducing stockouts despite late arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Sustained higher-demand regime: recent 5-period mean demand (Periods 13\u201317)=408.8; Actual lead time is variable and on average \u22482.27 (observed lead_times {1,3,3,2,3,1,3,2,3,1,3}), indicating shipments frequently arrive later than promised L=2.

Period 19 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-07-01). Recent history shows a sustained, substantially higher-demand regime (recent 5-period mean >> historical mean) and observed lead times are variable and on average >2. Current inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=1027 \u2014 substantial pipeline but arrivals have been irregular and delayed historically. I choose L=calculate to let the backend use the average of observed lead times (captures realized variability > promised 2). For demand (mu_hat) I choose recent_N with N=5 to target the current high-demand regime ((1+L)*mean of last 5 periods). For sigma_hat I choose recent_N with N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These settings push the OR backend to raise the base-stock to meet the elevated demand while using recent volatility/lead-time evidence to temper overstock risk given irregular arrivals.

Period 20 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-08 (Period 20). On-hand=0, in-transit=1093. Recent concluded history shows a sustained, materially higher demand regime and frequent lead-time delays/variability (many concluded lead_times > promised 2). To protect service while the OR engine uses promised L=2, set L estimation to 'calculate' so backend averages observed lead times (captures realized >2 behavior). Forecast demand using the most recent 5 periods (captures current accelerated regime mean \u2248502.4 units) and estimate volatility from the same 5-period window so base-stock and cap reflect realized demand and dispersion. These choices increase target inventory to avoid stockouts given late/variable arrivals while keeping sigma tied to recent variability so holding cost tradeoffs remain meaningful.

Carry-over insight: NEW: Sustained higher-demand regime \u2014 recent 5-period mean demand (Periods 15\u201319) \u2248502.4 vs historical ~130\u2013400; NEW: Actual lead time is variable and on average >2 (multiple concluded lead_times >=3), indicating shipments often arrive later than promised L=2.

Period 22 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-22). Recent demand has accelerated sharply: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 17-21) = [517,771,592,542,510], mean=586.4 \u2014 well above historical levels. On-hand=0, in-transit=1127 (large pipeline but arrivals are variable and often delayed). Observed concluded lead_times show high variability with average \u22482.23 (many \u22653), so use inferred average lead time rather than promised. Set L by 'calculate' to let backend use observed lead-time history. For demand forecast use recent_N (N=5) to capture the new, sustained high-demand regime for mu_hat. For sigma_hat also use recent_N (N=5) to reflect elevated volatility in the same recent window. These choices prioritize service (meet much higher demand) while letting the OR engine cap orders by its cap calculation to limit excess holding given the large in-transit volume.

Carry-over insight: NEW: Sustained, higher-demand regime \u2014 recent 5-period mean (Periods 17\u201321)=586.4 (demands 517,771,592,542,510). NEW: Actual lead time is variable and on average >2 (observed concluded lead_times average \u22482.23), shipments frequently arrive later than promised L=2.

Period 23 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29 (Period 23). Demand has been in a sustained, elevated regime: recent 5-period mean demand (Periods 18\u201322) is very high (~625 units) vs historical mean ~130\u2013200. On-hand=0 but large in-transit=1209 units; recent concluded lead_times show high variability and often >=2 (many 3-period observations and some 1s). To protect service while acknowledging volatile/longer realized lead times, I set L based on recent observed lead times and use recent-5 demand stats for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets (1+L)\xd7recent_mean and volatility over the same window. This increases target base-stock to cover the elevated demand and the variable arrivals while avoiding overly large cap adjustments.

Carry-over insight: Sustained higher-demand regime confirmed: recent 5-period mean demand (Periods 18\u201322) \u2248625 vs historical ~130\u2013200; Actual lead time is variable and often >= promised L=2 (multiple concluded lead_times =3), shipments frequently arrive later than promised.

Period 24 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/5 (Period 24). Recent periods show a sustained, elevated demand regime \u2014 last 5 concluded demands (Periods 19\u201323) average \u2248532.6 units. Observed lead times have been noisy and frequently >= promised L=2 (many concluded lead_times =3); shipments often arrive later than promised, risking stockouts despite large in-transit. To protect service given high recent demand and variable/often-late arrivals, I choose an explicit longer lead time and use a recent-5 demand estimate for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend sizes orders to cover the (review+lead) demand under the current regime.

Carry-over insight: NEW: Sustained higher-demand regime \u2014 recent 5-period mean demand (Periods 19\u201323) \u2248532.6 (evidence: demands 592,542,510,710,309). NEW: Actual lead time more variable and often longer than promised L=2 (multiple concluded lead_times =3), shipments frequently arrive later than promised.

Period 25 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 25). Recent periods show a sustained, elevated demand regime vs historical baseline: recent 5-period mean demand (Periods 20\u201324) = 449.4 units. Observed concluded lead_times are highly variable and on average >2 (all observed lead_times average \u22482.2), indicating shipments often arrive later than the promised L=2 and some orders are delayed or lost. On-hand=0, in-transit=1910 \u2014 pipeline is large but lead-time variability risks late arrivals. To protect service while acknowledging volatile, longer actual lead times, I set L to the empirical average of observed lead times (calculate). For demand I use a recent_N forecast over the last 5 periods to capture the new higher-demand regime (recent_N, N=5). For variability I use recent_N (N=5) so the OR engine sizes safety stock to the recent volatility. These choices increase target base_stock to cover the elevated demand over the review+lead window and incorporate recent lead-time/demand volatility, reducing stockouts despite delayed arrivals while controlling excessive holding through the capped order cap.

Carry-over insight: NEW: Sustained higher-demand regime \u2014 recent 5-period mean (Periods 20\u201324) = 449.4 vs historical much lower; NEW: Actual lead time is variable and on average \u22482.2 (observed concluded lead_times average \u22482.2), indicating shipments often arrive later than promised L=2.

Period 26 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/19 (Period 26). Recent history shows a sustained, higher-demand regime (recent 5-period mean elevated) and concluded shipments often arrive later than promised (many lead_times =3, some=1; average >2). On-hand=642 and in-transit=1136 provide strong short-term cover, but variable/greater-than-promised lead time risks stockouts if we underforecast. I set L explicitly to 2.25 to reflect observed lead-time averaging >2 and high variability. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current high-demand regime (most relevant for (1+L) forecast). I also set sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) so the backend measures volatility from the same recent high-demand window. These choices bias orders upward to protect service during the sustained high-demand regime and to buffer against longer/more variable actual lead times while the backend applies its capped policy.

Carry-over insight: Sustained higher-demand regime confirmed (recent 5-period means elevated vs historical); Actual lead time is variable and frequently >=2 with many lead_times=3 \u2014 shipments often arrive later than promised L=2.

Period 27 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019/8/26). On-hand=596, in-transit=1027. Historical concluded lead_times show high variability and average >2; demand has been in a sustained, elevated regime recently (large 5-period means). Pipeline + on-hand currently provides some coverage but demand remains elevated so use a demand forecast focused on the most recent regime. Choose L='calculate' so backend uses observed lead-time history to capture actual variability; choose mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to anchor forecasting to the current high-demand regime (last 5 periods) and raise both mean and volatility accordingly. This increases target base-stock to improve fill rates while sigma_hat recent_N inflates safety stock to account for observed variability.

Carry-over insight: Sustained higher-demand regime confirmed (recent 5-period means elevated vs historical); Actual lead time variable and frequently >=2 with many concluded lead_times =3, indicating shipments often arrive later than promised L=2.

Period 28 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/2 (Period 28). On-hand=457, in-transit=1027. Historical concluded lead_times show high variability and frequently > promised L=2; recent average lead_time is >2. Demand showed a prolonged high regime earlier but the most recent 5 concluded demands (Periods 23\u201327 = 309,176,132,155,139) average ~182, indicating demand has pulled back from earlier peaks. To balance service vs holding cost I: (1) set L using recent lead-time observations to capture increased/variable actual lead time; (2) set mu_hat using a short recent window (last 5 periods) so orders match the latest lower demand; (3) keep sigma_hat default so backend scales variability with chosen L. This approach reduces risk of stockouts from longer/variable lead times while avoiding excessive replenishment given the recent demand pullback.

Carry-over insight: NEW: Recent demand has pulled back vs earlier peak\u2014mean of last 5 concluded demands (Periods 23\u201327)=~182 vs prior multi-period means >350; Actual lead time remains variable and often >2 (recent concluded lead_times average >2).

Lead-time observations from concluded arrivals show variability and an average >2 (avg \u22482.22), so shipments often arrive later than promised L=2. To capture current shorter-demand regime while accounting for variable/longer actual lead times, I set L to 'calculate' (use observed average lead time), mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=5 to anchor the forecast to the recent 5-period mean, and sigma_hat to 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect recent demand volatility. This balances service (following elevated/volatile lead times) against holding cost given on-hand=379 and in-transit=1027.

Period 31 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/23 (Period 31). Recent 5-period concluded demand has pulled back substantially (Periods 26\u201330 demands = 155,139,78,65,30 \u2192 recent mean \u224893.4) versus earlier elevated regimes. On-hand=284 and in-transit=1027 \u2014 pipeline is ample vs short-term demand, so avoid inflating forecasts. Observed lead times have been variable and often > promised 2; use historical average lead time to capture this variability. Choose L=calculate to let backend use observed lead-time average; set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on most recent 5 periods to reflect the current downshift in demand while accounting for one-period review + lead. This reduces overstock risk given large pipeline and high holding cost relative to profit.

To reflect true shipping variability use calculated average lead time; to size order for the current, lower-demand regime use recent 5-period demand stats so the base-stock targets and caps respond to the pullback and avoid excess holding given holding cost >0.

Carry-over insight: NEW: Recent demand pullback confirmed \u2014 last 5 concluded demands (Periods 27\u201331) mean \u224869.4 (sustained lower-demand regime); NEW: Actual lead time remains variable and on average >2 (observed concluded lead_times average \u22482.15), shipments often arrive later than promised L=2.

Period 33 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/10/07 (Period 33). Recent history shows a clear demand pullback vs prior peak: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 28\u201332 = 78,65,30,35,62) average \u224854 \u2014 a sustained lower-demand regime. On-hand=187, in-transit=1027 (pipeline large). Observed concluded lead_times across history are volatile and on average >2, so use an empirically estimated L. Set L by averaging observed lead times (calculate) to reflect real arrival behavior. For demand forecast, use recent_N (N=5) to capture the new lower-demand regime when computing (1+L)\xd7mean. For sigma_hat use recent_N (N=5) to reflect current lower volatility. These choices reduce excess holding by aligning order targets with the recent lower demand while letting OR backend incorporate the empirical lead time into replenishment calculations.

Carry-over insight: NEW: Recent sustained demand pullback \u2014 last 5 concluded demands (Periods 28\u201332) mean \u224854 (lower regime); NEW: Actual lead time remains variable and on average >2 (historical concluded lead_times average >2), shipments often arrive later than promised L=2.

Period 34 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-14 (Period 34). Recent history shows a clear demand pullback: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 29\u201333 = 65,30,35,62,38) average ~46 units, far below earlier elevated regimes. However concluded lead_times remain variable and on average >2 (multiple concluded lead_times =3), so shipments often arrive later than the promised L=2. On-hand=149 and in-transit=1027 provide substantial coverage; using a shorter recent_N demand estimate avoids over-ordering into a lower-demand regime while acknowledging slower/more-variable arrivals. Set L method to calculate to let backend infer average observed lead time from concludes. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor forecasts to the current lower-demand regime and current volatility. This balances service (cover immediate demand) vs holding cost by lowering forecasted (1+L) demand relative to prior peak while still accounting for variable lead time via L=calculate.

Carry-over insight: NEW: Recent sustained demand pullback \u2014 last 5 concluded demands (Periods 29\u201333) mean \u224846 indicating a lower-demand regime; NEW: Actual lead time remains variable and on average >2 (multiple concluded lead_times =3), shipments often arrive later than promised L=2.

LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-21): recent concluded demand has pulled back to a lower regime. Last 5 concluded demands (Periods 30\u201334 = 30,35,62,38,43) mean=41.6. On-hand=106, in-transit=1027 (pipeline large vs current low demand). Recent arrival history shows the most recent five observed lead_times = {3,1,3,1,2} (Periods 22\u201326 arrivals), average=2.0. To avoid overstock while covering (1+L) periods of current low demand, set L based on the recent observed lead-times and set demand estimates from the recent 5-period regime. Methods: L = recent_N (N=5) to reflect actual recent lead-time average; mu_hat = recent_N (N=5) to capture the current low-demand regime; sigma_hat = recent_N (N=5) to capture recent volatility. This keeps orders responsive to the current low-demand environment while the large pipeline protects service level versus holding cost.

Carry-over insight: NEW: Recent sustained demand pullback \u2014 last 5 concluded demands (Periods 30\u201334) mean=41.6, indicating a lower-demand regime vs prior elevated periods; Recent observed lead_times (most recent 5 arrivals) average=2.0, so actual lead time currently aligns with promised L=2.

Period 37 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 37). Recent concluded demands show a sustained pullback: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 31\u201335) mean \u224845.6. On-hand=20 and large in-transit=1027 \u2014 pipeline already covers multiple periods even under elevated forecasts; avoid inflating forecasts from older high-demand regimes. Recent concluded lead_time observations align with promised L=2. Therefore use promised lead time (default) and set demand/volatility using the most recent 5-period regime so the OR backend sizes base-stock to current low-demand regime and avoids excess ordering against the large in-transit.

Carry-over insight: Recent lower-demand regime confirmed \u2014 last 5 concluded demands (Periods 31\u201335) mean=45.6; recent observed lead_time \u22482 aligning with promised L=2.

On-hand=0, in-transit=1027 (large pipeline). Recent observed lead-times have trended toward aligning with promised L=2. To avoid overstocking given large pipeline and low recent demand, keep L at the promised value (use default) so OR backend uses promised lead time; set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the current low-demand regime; keep sigma_hat as default to let backend use full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). This config reduces order targets to match the reduced demand while respecting pipeline inventory.

Recent observed lead_time averages \u22482 and aligns with promised L=2.

Recent observed lead_time aligns with promised L=2. Given the clear recent regime, set L to default (use promised lead time) and estimate demand and volatility from the most recent 5 periods so the OR engine targets the current lower demand while the large in-transit volume (1027) provides buffer versus lead-time variability.

Recent observed lead_time aligns with promised L=2 (recent concluded lead_times \u22482). Use promised lead time and base demand estimate anchored to the most recent 5-period regime to avoid overstocking after the pullback.

Carry-over insight: NEW: Recent lower-demand regime confirmed \u2014 last 5 concluded demands (Periods 38\u201342) mean\u224856; recent observed lead_time aligns with promised L=2.

Period 44 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (Period 44). On-hand=0, in-transit=1027. Recent concluded demand (Periods 39\u201343 = 17,113,51,57,58) shows a sustained lower-demand regime (5-period mean ~59). Recent concluded lead-times align with promised L=2. To avoid overstocking while meeting current lower demand, use promised lead time and base mu/sigma on the most recent 5 periods so the OR backend targets service appropriate to the current regime and reduces holding cost risk.

Period 45 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-30). On-hand=0, in-transit=1027. Recent history (Periods 40\u201344 demands = 113,51,57,58,57) shows a sustained lower-demand regime vs earlier peaks; recent observed lead_times have aligned with promised L=2. To avoid overstocking while covering the current low-demand regime, use promised lead time (default) and set mu_hat using recent 5-period mean (captures current lower demand). Keep sigma_hat default to reflect full-sample volatility scaled for (1+L). This balances service vs holding cost given large in-transit and lower recent demand.
