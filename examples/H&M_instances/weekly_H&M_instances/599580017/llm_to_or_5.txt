Period 1 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. SKU is seasonal swimwear (late Feb \u2014 pre-spring, potential rising demand approaching spring). No on-hand or in-transit inventory and no concluded arrivals yet. Historical demands = [61,98,152,129,213] show mean ~130.6 and moderate volatility (std ~51.3). No evidence of changed lead time or lost shipments (no conclude messages), so use promised lead time and default demand estimators. Set L to promised (0) so OR orders to cover current-period demand only; set mu_hat to (1+L)*mean(all samples)=130.6 and sigma_hat to sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples)=51.296 to reflect observed variability. These parameters balance service (higher mean to avoid stockouts approaching spring) against holding cost given profit=2 and holding=1.

Period 2 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. SKU 599580017 (swimwear bottom). Period-1 conclude shows our Period-1 order of 156 arrived with lead_time=0 and sold 156 (demand exceeded avail); on-hand=0, in-transit=0 now. No evidence of lead-time change or lost shipments. Use default (promised) lead time L=0. Historical sample mean = 130.6 units \u2192 set mu_hat = (1+L)*mean = 130.6 to cover current-period demand. Variability from samples: std \u2248 57.36 \u2192 sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std = 57.36. These defaults let the OR backend compute a base-stock balancing profit ($2) vs holding ($1) while replacing depleted on-hand inventory promptly given confirmed 0-period lead time.

Period 3 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent concluded history (Periods 1\u20132) shows both orders arrived same-period (lead_time=0). Demand samples = [61,98,152,129,213], mean=130.6, std\u224851.30. No calendar events or lost shipments observed. I set L to the observed average lead time (0) and use default mu/sigma (scale by 1+L) so the OR backend uses full-sample demand mean and variability to balance service level vs holding cost.

Period 4 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. Recent concluded arrivals show actual lead_time=0 for three consecutive periods (Period1-3 arrivals). Recent sell-through (demands 175,173,181) exceeds historical sample mean (130.6), indicating a recent upward demand regime but limited history. I keep L=promised (default=0) because concluded lead times consistently equal 0. For demand I use the default aggregate estimate to let the OR engine combine with its statistical policy; defaults: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_all_samples = 130.6 units (covers review+lead), sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std_all_samples = 51.30 units, which provide a moderate safety stock to balance profit vs holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1. This approach is conservative given the recent spike\u2014if elevated demand persists, switch to a recent_N estimate next period.

Carry-over insight: Recent demand spike: Periods 1-3 concluded demands = 175,173,181 (avg=176.3) > historical mean 130.6; treat as potential upward regime pending more confirmation.

Period 5 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25. Recent concluded demands show sustained uplift: Periods 1-4 demands = 175,173,181,200 (avg=182.25) vs historical mean ~130.6. All past concluded orders arrived with lead_time=0 periods (Periods 1-4). I treat the recent 4-period window as a new higher-demand regime and set L to the observed average lead time (0). I set mu_hat using recent_N over the last 4 concluded demands (N=4) => (1+L)*mean(last4)=182.25 to capture the elevated demand. I set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4) population std of the same window (\u224810.67) to reflect observed variability. These parameters increase the base-stock to reduce stockouts under the confirmed higher-demand regime while keeping L=0 since arrivals have consistently been same-period.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed upward demand regime: Periods 1-4 concluded demands = 175,173,181,200 (avg=182.25) > historical mean 130.6; treat as sustained until contradicted.

Period 6 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/1 (early spring swim season) + history shows a clear, sustained upward demand regime (recent concluded demands 175,173,181,200,268; recent avg=199.4 > historical mean). All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 so use observed lead time=0. Set L using average of observed lead times to reflect reliable same-period arrivals. For demand, use recent_N to capture the confirmed upward regime (N=5, the last 5 concluded periods) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_recent = 1*199.4 = 199.4. For volatility use recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent variability: sample std \u2248 35.6, sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std_recent = 35.6. These parameters raise the base-stock to meet the new higher demand while keeping L=0 (minimizing excess pipeline) and using observed volatility to balance service vs holding costs.

Period 7 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08. Recent concluded demands show a sustained upward regime (recent 6 demands = 175,173,181,200,268,376; mean=228.83) vs historical mean 130.6. All observed lead times = 0 (orders from Periods 1-6 arrived same period). I set L by averaging observed lead times (calculate) -> 0. For demand I use recent_N to capture the confirmed upward regime (N=6 -> mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last6)=228.8333). For volatility I use recent_N std over last 6 samples -> sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(last6)=73.3627. These parameters raise the base-stock to reflect the new higher demand while keeping L=0 since arrivals have been same-period, balancing service level against holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed upward demand regime: Periods 1-6 concluded demands = 175,173,181,200,268,376 (avg=228.83) \u2014 treat as sustained until contradicted.

Period 8 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 (Periods 1-7), so use promised/default L=0. Demand exhibits a sustained upward regime (recent concluded demands: 175,173,181,200,268,376,295); I focus on the most recent stable window to capture the current mean/volatility. Chosen methods: L=default (0) because observed lead times are consistently 0; mu_hat=recent_N using the last N=6 concluded demands (Periods 2-7) to represent the upward regime (mean = 248.8333) so base stock reflects current demand; sigma_hat=recent_N with N=6 to capture recent volatility (std \u2248 79.283). These parameters raise the base-stock to reduce stockouts in the confirmed higher-demand regime while sigma_hat informs safety stock to balance holding cost.

Period 9 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22. Product is seasonal swimwear; recent periods show a sustained upward demand regime. Observed concluded demands (Periods 1-8): [175,173,181,200,268,376,295,367] \u2014 mean=254.375, std\u224879.501. All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 historically. I set L using the observed lead times (calculate \u2192 0). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the last 8 samples to capture the confirmed upward regime: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last 8) to raise base-stock toward current demand; sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(last 8) to reflect elevated volatility. This increases order targets to improve service (profit $2 vs holding $1), while sigma raises safety stock to limit stockouts given high recent variability.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained upward demand regime through Period 8: Periods 1-8 mean=254.375, std\u224879.501; treat as active until contradicted.

Period 10 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 (Periods 1-9 concluded: arrived units reference ordered same period). Demand has shifted up and recent regime is best represented by the last 5 periods (Periods 5-9 demands = 268,376,295,367,477; mean=356.6, sample std\u224881.44). Set L to the observed average lead time=0. Use recent_N=5 to capture the confirmed upward demand regime so the OR engine raises the base-stock to meet higher demand while sigma reflects elevated volatility. This balances higher service (profit $2 vs holding $1) against holding cost by increasing mu_hat proportional to observed higher mean and using sigma_hat to size safety stock.

Period 11 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/6. All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 for orders placed Periods 1\u201310; demand has moved to a sustained upward regime (recent 10-period mean=298 units vs historical mean ~130.6). I set L by averaging observed lead times (calculate) = 0. For demand I use recent_N (N=10) to capture the new regime: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_recent10 = 298.0. For volatility I use recent_N (N=10): sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std_recent10 = 112.56. These choices ensure the OR engine targets service for the currently observed high-demand regime while reflecting realized variability; keeping L=0 matches confirmed same-period arrivals and avoids overstock from assuming longer lead times.

Period 12 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13 (Period 12). Recent history shows a sustained upward demand regime (concluded demands P1\u2013P11 average elevated; recent 10-period mean ~313.7). All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 historically. I therefore use promised lead time (L=0). For demand I use a recent_N estimator to capture the upward regime (N=10 \u2192 (1+L)*mean of last 10 concluded demands = 313.7). Volatility set as recent_N (N=10): sample std of last 10 concluded demands \u2248110.74 (sqrt(1+L)*std). These parameters bias orders toward higher service (reflecting confirmed demand spike) while keeping L at observed 0 to avoid inflating pipeline coverage and holding cost.

Period 13 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent history (Periods 1\u201312 concluded demands = [175,173,181,200,268,376,295,367,477,468,332,417]) shows a sustained upward demand regime vs. the earlier baseline. All observed arrivals have lead_time=0 historically, so use L=0. To capture the new regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 12 samples: mean = 310.75 units (forecast for the review+lead period with L=0) and sample std \u2248112.87. This raises the base-stock to meet much higher demand while sigma_hat reflects increased variability so the OR backend will size safety stock appropriately versus holding cost.

Period 14 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27. Recent periods show a sustained upward demand regime (higher mean and variance vs original historical). All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 consistently. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must cover next-period demand. I set L=default (promised 0) because concluded history (Periods 1\u201313) consistently reports lead_time=0. For demand I use a recent_N estimate (N=12, most recent 12 concluded demands Periods 2\u201313) to capture the confirmed upward regime while avoiding the older low-demand samples. mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(recent 12) = 327.0 units (targets service for the higher regime). sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=12) to reflect elevated volatility: std(recent 12) \u2248 105.35. These parameters raise the base-stock to prioritize service (profit $2 vs holding $1) while the higher sigma keeps safety stock for variability.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained upward demand regime through Period 13: Periods 1\u201313 mean\u2248315.31, recent 12-period mean=327.0 and elevated std\u2248105.35; treat as active until contradicted.

Period 15 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent history (Periods 1\u201314) shows a sustained upward demand regime (recent 12-period mean \u2248356.33, elevated volatility). All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 historically. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must cover current period demand plus elevated regime. Set L to promised/default (0) because concluded messages confirm 0 lead time. Use recent_N=12 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the confirmed upward regime (N=12 chosen because carry-over analysis identifies a sustained change and recent 12-period stats were previously referenced). This raises the base-stock forecast to match the new demand level while sigma reflects higher variability so the OR backend will size safety stock appropriately.

Period 16 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10. On-hand=73, in-transit=0. All concluded arrivals show actual lead_time=0, and recent demands (Periods 1\u201315) confirm a sustained upward regime (mean\u2248330.27). Use L=promised (default=0) because concluded lead-time observations are consistently 0. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using defaults over all concluded samples (1+L times mean and sqrt(1+L) times std) so the OR engine raises the base-stock to match the elevated demand while the sigma estimate captures increased volatility.

Period 19 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/1 (Period 19). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show all arrivals had lead_time=0 (orders in every conclude list), so actual lead time remains 0. Demand has been in a sustained upward regime through Period 18 (see evidence below). Use default lead time and set demand moments from full-sample historical concludes (Periods 1\u201318) to capture the persistent higher demand while letting the OR engine compute service level via profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 20 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/8 (Period 20). Recent history shows a sustained upward demand regime (large, persistent weekly demands through Period 19). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must order to cover next period. Observed concluded lead times for all past orders = 0 periods, so set L to the calculated average = 0. To capture the elevated demand level, I use a recent-window forecast: mu_hat = (1+L) * mean of the most recent 10 concluded demands (Periods 10\u201319) = 462.4 units. Volatility is set from the same 10-sample window: sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L) * sample std \u2248 145.27. These parameters push the OR engine base-stock to reflect the current high-demand regime while keeping lead-time consistent with observed arrivals.

Historical conclude messages show actual lead time = 0 each period; demand has been in a sustained high regime over recent periods (Periods 11\u201320 mean \u2248469.8, elevated volatility). I set L to promised (0) because concluded arrivals confirm lead_time=0. I use recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat (Periods 11\u201320) to capture the current upward regime while excluding earlier low-demand samples. This raises the base-stock target to meet current demand surge and balances service level vs holding cost by using recent mean and observed volatility.

Date 2019-07-22. Historical concluded arrivals show a sustained, strong upward demand regime (recent demands much larger than older baseline). All concluded lead-time observations (Periods 1\u201321) show lead_time=0 consistently, so use promised/default L=0. I set mu_hat using a recent_N approach to capture the current high-demand regime (last 20 concluded periods) rather than the small-sample historical baseline. sigma_hat uses recent_N (same 20) to reflect elevated volatility under the new regime. These parameters raise the base-stock to support service during the sustained uplift while sigma increases cap to avoid excessive over-ordering given higher variability.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained upward demand regime through Period 21: Periods 1\u201321 mean\u2248389.90; recent 20-period (Periods 2\u201321) mean\u2248400.65 and elevated volatility (std\u2248140); treat as active until contradicted.

Period 23 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019-07-29): recent history shows a sustained upward demand regime (Periods 2\u201321 recent-20 mean \u2248400.65, elevated volatility \u2248140) and every concluded arrival shows lead_time=0. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 -> no pipeline cover. I set L=default (promised 0) since concluded history consistently indicates 0 lead time. To capture the confirmed upward regime and elevated volatility I use recent_N=20 for demand estimates so the OR engine's base-stock reflects the new higher mean and risk: mu_hat = (1+L)*recent-20-mean \u2248400.65; sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*recent-20-std \u2248140. These parameters increase order targets to reduce stockouts given high demand while acknowledging holding cost via the OR engine's q tradeoff.

Period 24 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/5 (Period 24). Historical concluded arrivals show promised lead time=0 every period (observed lead times all 0). Demand has been in a sustained elevated regime; I use the recent 20-period regime (Periods 4\u201323) to capture the current higher mean and volatility. Set L = default promised (0). Set mu_hat using recent_N (N=20) = (1+L)*mean(recent20) = 433.9 to reflect the current elevated demand (~434 units per review+lead). Set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=20) = sqrt(1+L)*std(recent20) \u2248 148.4 to capture elevated volatility; this produces a higher base-stock and a wide cap to prioritize service given high lost-sales costs relative to holding. On-hand=186, in-transit=0 so orders will top up pipeline to the recent-regime base stock.

Period 25 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-08-12. History shows a sustained upward demand regime over many periods; all concluded arrivals have lead_time=0 and there are no in-transit units. On-hand=322 provides limited cover vs. elevated demand. I set L=default (promised lead time=0) because all concluded messages show lead_time=0. For demand I use recent_N (N=20) to capture the confirmed upward regime (Periods 5\u201324) \u2192 recent mean = 432.7 units; mu_hat = (1+L)*mean = 432.7. For volatility I use recent_N (N=20) \u2192 sample std \u2248150.49; sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std = 150.49. These parameters raise the base-stock to reflect the new higher demand while keeping lead time at the observed zero to avoid over-attributing delays; given profit $2 and holding $1 the backend will trade off service vs holding cost accordingly.

Period 26 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019/8/19. Historical concludes show actual lead time = 0 every period (orders arrived same period); on-hand=366, in-transit=0 so pipeline visible = 366. Demand has been in a sustained elevated regime; using full-sample statistics (recent sample mean \u2248380.6) to let the OR engine compute base-stock while keeping lead-time = promised. Chosen L=0 (observed lead times consistently 0). mu_hat set to the (1+L)-scaled mean of all concluded demands \u2248380.6 to capture the sustained higher demand. sigma_hat set to overall sample volatility (rounded) =150.0 to reflect elevated demand variability and avoid understocking. These parameters raise the backend base-stock to improve service given strong recent demand while accepting higher holding cost given current on-hand=366.

Period 27 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26 (Period 27). History shows a sustained high-demand regime for this swimwear SKU; recent periods (7\u201326) average materially above historical baseline. All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 so use promised lead time. I set L=default (0). For demand I use recent_N to capture the new regime: last 20 concluded demands (Periods 7\u201326) have mean=414.85 and elevated volatility (std\u2248171.82), so mu_hat = (1+L)*recent_mean and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*recent_std. These parameters raise the base-stock to cover the higher demand while the larger sigma increases safety stock to maintain service during volatile summer season; using recent_N avoids diluting the signal with older low-demand samples.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained upward demand regime through Period 26: recent 20-period mean (Periods 7\u201326) = 414.85, std \u2248 171.82; treat as active until contradicted.

Period 28 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 28). Lead-time history shows all concluded orders arrived same period (lead_time=0); no lost shipments observed. Recent demand has dropped sharply since the late-July peak \u2014 notable changepoint around Period 22 (demands: Periods22\u201327 = 710,309,176,132,155,139). I set L using default promised lead time (0). For demand I use a recent_N estimate (N=6) to capture the post-peak lower regime; mu_hat = mean of last 6 concluded demands = 270.1667 units (review+lead multiplier (1+L)=1). Volatility is estimated from the same recent 6 samples: sigma_hat = std \u2248 205.52 (sqrt(1+L) multiplier=1). These choices reduce ordering to match the recent demand downturn while keeping some buffer for high variability observed during the transition, balancing service (profit=$2/unit) vs holding cost ($1/unit/period). On-hand=350 and in-transit=0 so OR backend will cap orders accordingly.

Carry-over insight: Recent downward demand regime beginning ~Period 22: Periods 22\u201327 demands = [710,309,176,132,155,139], recent-6 mean=270.17, std\u2248205.5; treat as active until contradicted.

Period 29 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/9 (Period 29). Recent regime: demand shifted down beginning ~Period 22 (see Periods 22\u201328). All concluded lead-times = 0 historically; use promised lead time. I use a recent-N demand estimate anchored on the detected changepoint (Periods 22\u201328, N=7) to capture the post-spike downturn. mu_hat set to the (1+L)-scaled mean of the last 7 concluded demands (Periods 22\u201328 = [710,309,176,132,155,139,78]) to avoid over-ordering from earlier high-volume periods. sigma_hat uses the sample std of the same 7-period window to reflect elevated volatility in the new regime. This keeps the base-stock responsive to the weaker recent demand while preserving safety stock for volatility, balancing service level (profit per unit $2) against holding cost ($1/unit/period).

Period 30 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/16.

All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 historically. On-hand=272, in-transit=0 \u2192 ample coverage vs current lower-demand regime. I set L to promised (0) because concluded messages consistently show 0. I set mu_hat using recent_N (N=8) to capture the post-period-22 regime mean (mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_last8 = 220.5) to avoid over-ordering given current low demand and high on-hand. I set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=8) (std_last8 \u2248 211.37) to reflect observed volatility in the recent regime; this gives the OR engine accurate uncertainty for safety stock vs holding cost tradeoff.

Period 31 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-09-23 (Period 31). On-hand=282, in-transit=0. Historical concluded demands show a clear downward regime since ~Period 22; recent demands (Periods 23\u201330 = [309,176,132,155,139,78,65,30]) average 135.5 with elevated volatility. To avoid excess holding cost given large on-hand stock, set lead time to promised (default L=0) and forecast demand using recent_N = 8 samples. mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last 8) = 135.5 units. sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(last 8) = 85.96 units. This reduces target base-stock relative to the earlier high-regime forecasts, lowering order quantities to burn down on-hand inventory while still covering expected demand and accounting for observed volatility.

Carry-over insight: Downward demand regime persisted through Period 30: Periods 23\u201330 demands = [309,176,132,155,139,78,65,30], recent-8 mean=135.5, std\u224885.96 \u2014 treat as active until contradicted.

On-hand = 247, in-transit = 0; with L=0 the OR decision must cover current-period demand only. To avoid excess holding given elevated past volatility but clearly lower recent demand, I use a recent_N demand estimate (N=8) to capture the downward regime. This reduces forecast bias from earlier high-season peaks and balances service vs. holding cost.

Period 33 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/10/07 (Period 33). Recent history shows a clear downward demand regime since ~Period 22; last 8 concluded demands (Periods 25\u201332) = [132,155,139,78,65,30,35,62], mean=87.0, std\u224845.41. All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 historically. On-hand=185, in-transit=0 \u2014 about 2.1\xd7 the recent-period demand mean, so we should lower replenishment to match the new lower regime and avoid holding costs. I set L to the observed average (0). I use recent_N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-changepoint low-demand regime so the OR backend will target a much lower base-stock and cap, reducing excess inventory while preserving service for the current lower-demand environment.

Carry-over insight: New sustained downward demand regime confirmed (Periods 25\u201332 mean=87.0, std\u224845.4); use recent-8 for short-term forecasts until contradicted.

All observed lead_times in concluded history = 0; no evidence of delayed or lost shipments. I therefore keep L at the promised lead time (0). To follow the recent downward regime I use recent_N forecasting (N=8, Periods 25\u201332) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine's base-stock reflects the lower demand and reduced volatility, limiting excess holding costs given holding=$1/unit and profit=$2/unit.

Period 35 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21 (Period 35). Historical concluded lead times have been 0 consistently; no in-transit stock and on-hand=104. Recent demand has settled into a downward regime; the most recent 8 concluded demands (Periods 27\u201334 = [139,78,65,30,35,62,38,43]) show a short-term mean of 61.25 and std\u224835.61. I choose L=default (promised 0) because concluded history shows lead_time=0. For demand I use recent_N (N=8) to capture the confirmed downward regime and reduced mean/volatility; this keeps the base-stock low to avoid excess holding cost given current low demand. With on-hand=104 > short-term forecast (61.25) no immediate replenishment is needed.

Carry-over insight: Newer confirmed downward short-term regime: Periods 27\u201334 mean=61.25, std\u224835.61 (use recent-8 for short-term forecasts).

Period 36 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Demand has been in a confirmed downward regime (Periods 28\u201335). Recent 8-period demand (Periods 28\u201335 = [78,65,30,35,62,38,43,50]) averages ~50.13 with low volatility. No in-transit inventory and all historical concluded lead_times = 0, so use promised lead time. Set L=default (0). Use recent_N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new low-demand regime and reduced volatility, keeping orders modest to avoid holding costs while maintaining service.

Carry-over insight: Sustained downward demand regime active (Periods 28\u201335 recent-8 mean=50.125, std\u224816.78); use recent-8 for short-term forecasts until contradicted.

Period 37 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 37). Recent history and carry-over insights show a sustained downward demand regime since ~Period 22 with a clear low-demand regime in Periods 28\u201335 (recent-8 mean=50.125, std\u224816.78). All observed lead-times in concluded history = 0 periods, and there are no in-transit units (on-hand=22, in-transit=0). Given the short/no lead-time reliability and the low recent demand regime, set lead time L to promised/default (0). Forecast demand across review+lead as the recent-8 mean to reflect the downward regime and reduce excess stock. Use recent-8 volatility for sigma_hat so the OR backend sets a modest base-stock with lower safety stock, balancing service level vs holding cost given high holding cost relative to profit. This keeps orders small (covers expected current-period demand) and avoids large ending inventory holding penalties.

Period 38 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 38).

On-hand=17, in-transit=0, promised lead time=0 and all concluded lead-times=0. I set L to promised (0) because concluded history shows consistent 0-period lead time. For demand I use recent_N (N=8) to capture the confirmed downward regime and avoid overreacting to earlier high-season spikes: mu_hat = (1+L)*recent-8 mean = 41.0. For volatility I use recent_N (N=8): sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*recent-8 std \u2248 9.79.

Period 41 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/2. Product is womens swimwear (seasonal \u2014 demand has dropped post summer). History shows lead_time consistently 0 in concluded messages. Recent demand regime is downward (post-peak summer). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish but avoid overstock given low off-season sales. I set L to promised lead time (0) because concluded arrivals confirm 0. For demand I use recent_N (N=8) to capture the confirmed downward regime (Periods 33\u201340 concluded demands: [38,43,50,36,34,42,17,113], recent-8 mean=46.625) so mu_hat=(1+L)*mean_recent=46.625. Volatility is set to recent-8 std (sqrt(1+L)*std_recent) = 28.485 to reflect observed variability (large spike at period 40 but overall low levels). These parameters keep the OR base-stock conservative to balance service vs holding cost in off-season.

Carry-over insight: New sustained downward demand regime active (Periods 33\u201340 recent-8 mean=46.625, std\u224828.485); use recent-8 for short-term forecasts until contradicted.

Period 42 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09. Recent history shows a sustained downward demand regime (recent-8 mean\u224846.625, std\u224828.485) and many concluded periods with actual lead_time=0. On-hand=8, in-transit=0 \u2014 low cover. Promised lead time=0 has been reliable; I therefore use L=default (0). To capture the current low-demand regime I use recent-8 for demand forecast (matches carried-over insight recommending recent-8). mu_hat set to (1+L)*recent-8 mean = 46.625 to target service while avoiding excess holding given high holding cost relative to profit. sigma_hat set to sqrt(1+L)*recent-8 std = 28.485 to reflect observed variability.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Promised lead time 0 has been consistently observed (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0). Recent demand has settled into the downward regime flagged in carry-over: use the most recent 8 concluded demands (Periods 35\u201342 = [50,36,34,42,17,113,51,57]) which have mean=50.0 and std\u224826.52. On-hand=4, in-transit=0 \u2192 low pipeline. Set L=default (0) so orders arrive same period per promise. Use recent-8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current low-demand regime while allowing for elevated volatility (the 113 outlier increases std). These parameters keep base-stock modest (limits holding cost) but allow the OR engine to provide some safety stock for variability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $111.00

Period 44 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=0; recent demand has entered a sustained downward regime (low weekly sales since Period 36). Use promised L=0. For demand forecast use recent-8 (Periods 36\u201343) to capture the current low regime: mean=51.0 units and elevated but moderate volatility (std\u224828.485). These parameters reduce overstocks vs. holding cost while preserving service for the current lower-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: New sustained downward demand regime confirmed (Periods 36\u201343 demands = [36,34,42,17,113,51,57,58]; recent-8 mean=51.0, std\u224828.485). Treat as active until contradicted.

Period 45 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30 (post-Christmas). Recent history shows the downward regime from Periods 36\u201343 with recent-8 mean\u224851 and std\u224828.49; on-hand=7, in-transit=0, and all concluded lead-times historically =0. Use promised lead time (L=0). Set mu_hat based on recent-8 to capture current low-demand regime: mu_hat=(1+L)*recent8_mean\u224851. Use sigma_hat from recent-8 volatility: sigma_hat= sqrt(1+L)*recent8_std\u224828.485. This keeps base-stock conservative to avoid excess holding cost while preserving service for the current low-demand regime.
