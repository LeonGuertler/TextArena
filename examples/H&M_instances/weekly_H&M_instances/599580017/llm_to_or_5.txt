Period 1 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Recent demand samples = [61,98,152,129,213], mean=130.6. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we need coverage for current + lead periods. No concluded arrivals to suggest lead-time drift or lost shipments. Use promised lead time and population statistics: L default (promised 4), mu_hat default => (1+L)\xd7mean anchors replenishment to 5\xd7130.6, sigma_hat default to reflect observed variability. This balances service (covering five periods of demand) against holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

Period 2 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/4 (Period 2). Historical demands = [61,98,152,129,213] (mean=130.6). On-hand=0, in-transit=225 (order placed Period 1 not yet concluded/arrived). No concluded arrivals exist to infer actual lead time; treat promised lead time (4) as current L. Use default demand aggregation so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples)=5\xd7130.6 (backend will compute). Volatility use default to reflect full-sample variability scaled by sqrt(1+L). This keeps the OR engine aligned with historical demand and the promised lead time while the outstanding shipment awaits conclusion; if the Period 1 order fails to conclude in future periods, revise L explicitly.

Period 3 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019-03-11). SKU 599580017 swim bottoms: on-hand=0, in-transit=453 (equals orders 225 in P1 + 228 in P2). Historical demands = [61,98,152,129,213], mean=130.6. No 'arrived=...' conclude entries observed, so actual lead time cannot be inferred\u2014orders are simply still in-transit. Use promised lead time (default) and default demand pooling to let the OR engine compute (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility; this keeps parameters aligned with backend assumptions and avoids overreacting to absent concludes.

Carry-over insight: Outstanding in-transit 453 units from orders placed in Periods 1\u20132 (225 + 228); no arrivals have been concluded yet.

Period 4 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 4). Recent concluded periods show no arrivals yet, but promised lead time is 4 and none of the orders are yet due to conclude (orders from Periods 1\u20133 would conclude later), so do not adjust lead time. Historical demand samples = [61,98,152,129,213], mean \u2248130.6; use default demand aggregation to cover review+lead period (1+L)\xd7mean. Volatility use default (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples). This keeps parameters consistent with the backend's base-stock calculation while avoiding premature reactions to missing arrivals.

Period 5 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 5). Recent realized demand has trended up (Periods1-4 demands: 175,173,181,200) vs older baseline samples. No concluded arrivals for any orders; in-transit=787 (orders placed P1-P4) and arrivals remain unconfirmed, so actual lead time is unknown\u2014do not infer a shorter L from missing arrivals. I keep L at the promised/default so the OR engine uses the contract lead time. To capture the recent uptick in demand I set mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) so the review+lead demand forecast reflects the four most recent periods. Volatility also updated with recent_N (N=4) to reflect current variability. These choices increase target base-stock to improve service during the rising-demand regime while leaving lead-time assumptions to the contract (avoids overcorrecting for potential lost shipments).

Carry-over insight: Outstanding in-transit inventory now 787 units (orders from Periods 1-4: 225+228+228+106); no arrivals have been concluded\u2014possible prolonged lead time or lost shipments.

Period 6 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-04-01). On-hand=0, in-transit=699; recent concluded arrival shows order from Period 1 had lead_time=4 (matches promised). Several in-transit orders remain unconfirmed\u2014risk of lost shipments. I set L by averaging observed lead times (calculate) since we have a confirmed 4-period lead time. Demand has trended up across the last 5 periods (demands 175,173,181,200,268), so I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the uptick and for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. These choices increase target base-stock to cover the (1+L) review+lead horizon while keeping variance estimates focused on the latest regime to balance service level vs holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Outstanding in-transit remains large (699 units at Period 6) with prolonged absence of concluded arrivals for many orders; confirmed lead_time=4 for the Period 1 order (arrived in Period 5) but other shipments remain unconfirmed \u2014 potential lost shipments.

Period 7 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08 (Period 7). Recent realized demands are high and volatile (historical demands: [61,98,152,129,213] seed; recent concluded demands in periods show spikes up to 376). Current on-hand=0, in-transit=736; several orders placed in Periods 3-6 remain unconfirmed suggesting partial losses or prolonged lead-time variability. Observed concluded lead times: 4 periods (orders from Periods 1 and 2). To be robust to the confirmed 4-period arrivals while letting the OR engine use its stats, set L to 'calculate' (backend will average observed lead times). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this leverages all data while the calculated L captures confirmed lead-time regime. This balances service (covering L+1 periods of demand given confirmed 4-period arrivals) against holding cost given moderate profit/holding ratio.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead_time=4 for orders placed in Periods 1\u20132 (evidence: Period 5 conclude: arrived=225 from Period 1, lead_time=4; Period 6 conclude: arrived=228 from Period 2, lead_time=4). Remaining in-transit from Periods 3\u20136 remain unconfirmed and may indicate lost shipments.

Period 8 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019/4/15). Recent concludes confirm actual lead_time = 4 for multiple early orders and demand has been high and volatile (historic demands [61,98,152,129,213]; recent concluded period demands: 268,376,295). Current inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=775 \u2014 large pipeline with some prior late/unconfirmed shipments but recent evidence supports L=4. I choose L=default to use the promised lead time (4) since concludes align with it. Use mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR backend computes (1+L)-period demand mean and sqrt(1+L)-scaled std from all samples, letting the capped ordering rule balance service level vs holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

Period 9 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22 (Period 9). Recent concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=4 (Periods 5\u20138 concluded orders from Periods 1\u20134 with W=4). Demand has stepped up materially since Period 5 (period demands: 268, 376, 295, 367), indicating a new high-demand regime. On-hand=0 and large in-transit (945) exist, but concluded arrivals confirm L=4 for observed shipments. To capture the new demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent data (last 5 periods) and set L from observed lead times (calculate). This raises the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility so the OR engine will target a higher base stock to avoid stockouts while capping orders via its cap constraint.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained actual lead_time=4 (evidence: Periods 5\u20138 conclude: arrived from Periods 1\u20134 with lead_time=4); demand regime increased starting Period 5 (evidence: period demands 268,376,295,367).

Period 10 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/29 (Period 10). On-hand=0, in-transit=1230. Concluded arrivals from Periods 5\u20139 show actual lead_time=4 for multiple past orders, and no evidence of longer/shorter lead time\u2014set L based on observed average. Demand increased markedly starting Period 5 (period demands 268, 376, 295, 367, 477); use recent-period estimates (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the new higher-demand regime and avoid understocking. These choices balance service (use recent higher mean) against holding cost by relying on OR engine cap and updated volatility.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained actual lead_time=4 (evidence: Periods 5\u20139 concludes: arrivals from Periods 1\u20135 with lead_time=4); Demand regime increased starting Period 5 (evidence: demands 268,376,295,367,477).

Period 11 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-05-06): on-hand=0, in-transit=1456. Concluded history shows sustained actual lead_time=4 (arrivals from Periods 1\u20136 all with lead_time=4) and a demand regime shift upward starting Period 5 (higher demands from Periods 5\u201310). To protect service with the new higher demand while respecting confirmed L=4, I set L to be calculated from observed lead times. I use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the post-change demand regime (Periods 5\u201310), so the OR backend will size base-stock to cover the larger recent demand and the observed variability, balancing profit vs holding cost.

Observed history shows confirmed sustained actual lead_time=4 (arrivals from Periods 1\u20137 concluded with lead_time=4) and a clear upward demand regime beginning Period 5 (recent demands: 295,367,477,468,332). On-hand=0, in-transit=1692 (large pipeline). I keep L as default (promised lead time=4) because concluded history matches promised lead time; for demand I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the new, higher-demand regime (focus on last 5 observed demands). For volatility I also use recent_N N=5 to reflect recent demand variability. These choices bias the backend base_stock toward the elevated recent mean and recent variability, improving service during the higher-demand regime while the large in-transit pipeline limits additional emergency ordering risk.

Period 13 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-20): on-hand=0, in-transit=1742. Concluded arrivals from Periods 5\u201312 consistently show orders placed earlier arriving with lead_time=4 (evidence: Period 5\u201312 conclude messages), so actual lead time = 4. Demand regime increased starting Period 5 (demands for Periods 5\u201312 = [268,376,295,367,477,468,332,417]); use a recent-regime estimate to capture higher mean and volatility. To align the OR backend to the higher-demand regime and long/confirmed lead time, set L to promised (default=4) and use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the base-stock reflects (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of the last 8 periods' demand.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained actual lead_time=4 (arrivals in Periods 5\u201312 correspond to orders placed 4 periods earlier); Demand regime increased starting Period 5 (evidence: Periods 5\u201312 demands: 268,376,295,367,477,468,332,417).

Period 14 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-27): on-hand=52, in-transit=1527. Concluded history shows consistent arrivals with lead_time=4 for orders placed in Periods 1-9, confirming actual lead_time=4. Demand regime increased beginning Period 5 (sustained higher demands: 268,376,295,367,477,468,332,417,370). Given persistent higher recent demand and large pipeline, set L to promised (4) and base demand estimates using the recent high-demand regime. Choose recent_N (N=9, the length of the high-demand regime) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new mean/volatility over the (1+L) review+lead window. This balances service (capture elevated demand) against holding cost given already-large in-transit; the OR backend will cap orders if pipeline suffices.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained actual lead_time=4 (evidence: concluded arrivals from Periods 5-13 correspond to orders placed 4 periods earlier). Demand regime increased starting Period 5 (evidence: Periods 5-13 demands = 268,376,295,367,477,468,332,417,370).

Period 15 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03 (Period 15). Recent history shows confirmed sustained actual lead_time=4 (arrivals from orders placed 4 periods earlier across Periods 5-14). Demand shifted up starting Period 5 (post-change demands: 268,376,295,367,477,468,332,417,370,525 \u2192 10 samples). To capture the higher demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=10 (use (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over last 10 samples). I keep L as default (promised lead time=4) since concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4. Using recent estimates focuses the base-stock on the new higher-demand regime while reflecting recent volatility; this mitigates stockouts given long lead time and large in-transit position, and avoids overstating variability from older low-demand periods.

Period 16 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-06-10). Recent demand regime increased starting Period 5 (sustained higher weekly demand: periods 5-15). On-hand=191, in-transit=1420 (large pipeline covering multiple weeks). Actual lead time has been consistently 4 periods in concluded history. I set L to default (promised lead time=4) because concluded arrivals confirm LT=4. To capture the post-change higher demand, I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=11 (regime from Periods 5\u201315, length=11) so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std using the recent elevated-demand samples. This balances higher service level needs while keeping safety stock responsive to current volatility and avoids overreacting to older low-demand data.

Period 17 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-17 (Period 17). On-hand=215, in-transit=1481. Concluded history shows consistent actual lead_time=4 since Period 5 and a sustained higher-demand regime starting Period 5 (period demands 268,376,295,367,477,468,332,417,370,525,330,302). Use promised lead time (default=4) because concluded arrivals confirm L=4. For demand, use recent_N over the post-changepoint regime (Periods 5\u201316, 12 samples) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the higher recent mean and volatility; set N=12 for both. This focuses the base-stock on the current high-demand regime and the known 4-period lead time, improving service while avoiding overstating uncertainty from older low-demand samples. The approach also implicitly accounts for missing/late shipments by relying on concluded arrivals (confirming L=4) and recent demand behavior.

Period 18 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-24): recent demand regime is elevated since Period 5 (higher weekly swimwear demand through early summer). On-hand=0, in-transit=1542 (large pipeline). Concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead_time=4 for concluded orders -> set L using observed lead times. To capture the sustained higher-demand regime (Periods 5\u201317), set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=13 (Periods 5\u201317) so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the upshifted demand samples. This balances service (higher \u03bc\u0302 to meet summer demand) while using observed lead time to avoid underordering given a large but delayed pipeline.

Period 19 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-07-01). Recent periods show a sustained actual lead_time=4 (confirmed by concluded arrivals Periods 5\u201318 matching orders placed 4 periods earlier) and a higher demand regime beginning Period 5 (many demands 268\u2013771). On-hand=0, in-transit=1661 (large pipeline). To reflect confirmed lead time and the persistent higher-demand regime, use promised lead time (default L=4) and compute demand forecasts from the recent high-demand regime. Select recent_N with N=14 (Periods 5\u201318) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets (1+L)-period demand under the current regime while the large pipeline helps cover near-term demand spikes.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained actual lead_time=4 (evidence: concluded arrivals in Periods 5\u201318 correspond to orders placed 4 periods earlier); Demand regime increased starting Period 5 (evidence: Periods 5\u201318 demands = 268,376,295,367,477,468,332,417,370,525,330,302,517,771).

Period 20 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-08 (Period 20). On-hand=0, in-transit=1679. Concluded arrivals across Periods 5\u201319 confirm a stable actual lead_time=4 (arrivals correspond to orders placed 4 periods earlier). Demand regime rose sharply starting Period 5 (sustained higher demands from Periods 5\u201319). To reflect confirmed L=4 and the new higher-demand regime, I keep L at promised (default) so backend uses the known 4-period promise, and use recent_N (N=15) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor forecast and volatility to the post-changepoint regime (Period 5 onward length \u224815). This balances service (captures higher recent mean) while capping orders via backend cap to limit excess pipeline given large existing in-transit; explicit handling of potentially lost older shipments is unnecessary here because conclude history shows consistent 4-period arrivals recently.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained actual lead_time=4 (arrivals in Periods 5\u201319 correspond to orders placed 4 periods earlier); Demand regime increased starting Period 5 (evidence: sustained higher demands in Periods 5\u201319).

Period 21 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-15 (Period 21). On-hand=0, in-transit=1879. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead_time=4 (arrivals from orders placed 4 periods earlier). Demand regime increased starting Period 5 (sustained higher demands through Period 20). I set L to default (promised lead time = 4) because concluded history confirms stable 4-period lead time. For forecasting I use recent_N with N=16 to capture the post-change higher-demand regime (Period 5\u201320 length = 16); using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat ensures the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the elevated-demand regime and thus balances higher service needs against holding cost. This also accounts for large pipeline (1879) when backend computes final order = min(base_stock \u2212 pipeline, cap).

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained actual lead_time=4 (arrivals in Periods 5\u201320 correspond to orders placed 4 periods earlier); Demand regime increased starting Period 5 (evidence: sustained higher demands in Periods 5\u201320).

Period 23 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-07-29 (Period 23). Historical concludes consistently show actual lead_time=4 for concluded orders (Periods 5-22 mapping to orders placed 4 periods earlier). Demand regime shifted higher starting Period 5 and has persisted through Period 22. On-hand=0, in-transit=1839 (large pipeline). Choose L by averaging observed lead times to capture confirmed actual L=4. For demand, use recent_N over the post-changepoint regime (Period 5\u201322, length 18) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the sustained higher-demand regime and reduce bias from earlier low samples. These parameters align the OR base-stock target to the current high-demand regime while accounting for the confirmed lead time and large pipeline to balance service level vs holding cost.

Period 24 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/5 (Period 24). Observed on-hand=234, large in-transit=1863. Concluded history confirms stable actual lead_time=4 and a sustained higher-demand regime beginning Period 5 (demands from Periods 5\u201323 are materially larger than early periods). To match confirmed lead time and recent higher demand, use default L (promised lead time=4) and estimate demand using recent samples from the new regime. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat via recent_N using N=19 (covering Periods 5\u201323) so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std; this raises base-stock and safety stock to meet elevated demand while acknowledging confirmed lead time and avoiding understock from using older low-demand data.

Period 25 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-08-12). History shows confirmed sustained actual lead_time=4 (consistent arrivals for orders placed 4 periods earlier) and a clear demand regime shift upward starting Period 5 (sustained higher demands since). Current on-hand=645 and in-transit=1547 \u2014 ample pipeline but demand remains elevated. I keep L=default (use promised lead time=4). For demand I use recent_N over the post-change regime to capture the new higher mean/volatility: choose N=20 (regime length Period5\u201324 = 20 samples) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from the most relevant 20 observations. This balances service (higher target stock for higher demand) against holding costs given substantial in-transit inventory.

Period 26 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19 (Period 26). On-hand=934, in-transit=1243. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead_time=4 and a sustained higher-demand regime beginning Period 5; recent demands since Period 5 are much larger than the initial five-sample seed. To align forecasting with the higher-demand regime, I use recent_N with N=20 (captures the most recent 20-period regime data) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. For L I keep the default promised lead time (4) because concluded history consistently confirms lead_time=4 and the OR backend expects the promised L. These settings direct the OR engine to size the (1+L)-period forecast using the most recent regime data, improving service during the sustained high-demand period while sigma_hat recent_N captures current volatility to avoid over/under-stocking.

Period 27 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/26 (Period 27). Observed on-hand=1067, in-transit=1063. Concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead_time=4 for many periods; demand regime increased starting Period 5 (sustained higher weekly demands thereafter). Set L by calculating observed lead times to reflect confirmed L=4. For demand forecast (mu_hat) use recent_N over the post-changepoint regime (Periods 5 onward) to capture the higher demand; regime length permits using N=20 (caps at 20). Apply the same recent_N window for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. These choices align the OR base-stock calculation to the sustained higher demand and confirmed 4-period lead time, improving service while avoiding excess stock from older low-demand data.

Period 28 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-09-02). On-hand=1495, in-transit=606. Historical concludes show a sustained actual lead_time=4 (arrivals consistently correspond to orders placed 4 periods earlier). Demand regime shifted higher beginning Period 5; use recent regime data to forecast. Set L to promised (default=4) since concluded history confirms LT=4. Use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the higher, sustained demand regime (use max cap 20 of recent regime samples). This biases orders toward meeting the elevated demand while the large on-hand position tempers immediate ordering risk.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained actual lead_time=4 (evidence: concluded arrivals in Periods 5\u201327 correspond to orders placed 4 periods earlier); Demand regime increased starting Period 5 (evidence: sustained higher demands in Periods 5\u201327).

Period 29 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/9 (Period 29). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime starting Period 5 and concluded arrivals consistently indicate actual lead_time=4. Current inventory: on-hand=1688, in-transit=444. Given confirmed L=4, forecast and variability should reflect the post-Period-5 elevated demand regime. I select L=default to use the promised/confirmed 4-period lead time. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the recent higher-demand regime (regime length from Period 5 to Period 28 \u224824, capped at 20). This focuses the base-stock calculation on the current high-demand period and the matching variability, balancing service (avoid stockouts under elevated demand) against holding cost given ample on-hand inventory.

Demand regime increased beginning Period 5 (sustained higher demands through Period 29). To capture the post-change demand statistics I use recent_N with N=20 (captures most recent regime while capping at 20). Keep L as default (promised=4) since concluded history confirms lead_time=4. Using recent statistics for mu_hat and sigma_hat balances higher recent demand (improves service) while avoiding overreaction to single-period spikes.

Current inventory: on-hand=1818, in-transit=239 (no overdue/lost signals currently). Choose L by averaging observed lead times to capture confirmed actual lead_time=4. For demand, use recent_N with N=20 to focus the forecast on the sustained high-demand regime (Periods 11\u201330 most relevant) and limit influence of early low-demand samples. Use recent_N N=20 for sigma_hat to measure volatility in the new regime. These settings give the OR backend a lead time that matches reality and mu/sigma that prioritize service during the sustained higher-demand period while controlling holding cost.

On-hand=1893 and in-transit=129 are ample vs. recent demand; still use lead_time=default (promised=4) since concluded data confirms it.

Given stable lead time and sustained higher demand but large on-hand, use default lead time (promised=4) and default demand/volatility estimates so the OR backend applies the (1+L)\xd7sample mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples. This avoids overreacting to short-term fluctuations while the system continues to observe concludes.

Period 35 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-10-21 (Period 35). On-hand is high (1879) and in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead_time=4 for concluded orders (Periods 5\u201334 arrivals correspond to orders placed 4 periods earlier). Demand regime shifted up starting Period 5 and has persisted. I set L by calculating the average observed lead time (consistent at 4). For demand forecast I use a recent_N estimate to capture the post-change (Period 5+) higher-demand regime using the most recent 20 samples. Sigma uses default to let the backend scale volatility across the (1+L) horizon. These choices keep target base-stock aligned to the sustained higher demand and the confirmed 4-period lead time while avoiding overreacting to short-term noise; with high on-hand, the OR cap will limit ordering to avoid excess holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained actual lead_time=4 (evidence: concluded arrivals in Periods 5\u201334 correspond to orders placed 4 periods earlier); Demand regime increased starting Period 5 and has remained elevated (evidence: higher demands in Periods 5\u201334).

Recent conclude history shows stable actual lead_time=4 and earlier higher-demand regime, but recent realized demand has been low (~30\u201350 per period) and we currently hold large safety stock. No outstanding arrivals to reconcile. To avoid adding inventory while on-hand is ample, use defaults so backend (which knows promised L=4 and full demand history) computes base-stock from its demand estimates and recommended cap. This suppresses aggressive replenishment given current high on-hand and zero pipeline.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/18 (Period 39). On-hand=1717, in-transit=0. Actual lead time has been consistently 4 periods (concluded arrivals correspond to orders placed 4 periods earlier). Demand regime increased starting Period 5 and has remained elevated \u2014 use recent historical regime to size forecast. Set L to promised (default=4) to align with supplier promise and observed confirmations. Set mu_hat using recent_N (N=20) to capture the elevated-demand regime (use last 20 demand samples from the high-demand period) so base stock covers (1+L) periods of the current regime. Set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=20) so safety stock reflects recent volatility. This balances high service (avoid stockouts given strong ongoing demand) against holding cost by basing forecasts on the sustained higher-demand window.

Period 40 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/25 Period 40. On-hand is high (1700) and in-transit=0; recent history shows consistent actual lead_time=4 (concluded arrivals from Periods 5\u201339 map to orders placed 4 periods earlier). Demand regime increased starting Period 5 and has remained elevated. Set L by averaging observed lead times to reflect confirmed actual L=4. For demand forecasts use recent_N with N=20 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (changepoint at Period 5) while limiting to a 20-period window to be responsive to recent demand. Use recent_N for sigma_hat with N=20 to reflect recent volatility. This keeps base stock aligned to the higher post-changepoint mean while capping exposure via the OR engine's cap.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained actual lead_time=4 (arrivals in Periods 5\u201339 correspond to orders placed 4 periods earlier); Demand regime increased starting Period 5 and has remained elevated (use recent 20 periods for forecasting).

Period 41 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/2 (Period 41). On-hand=1587, in-transit=0; no outstanding arrivals to cover future demand. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead_time=4 (arrivals from orders placed 4 periods earlier across many periods). Demand regime shifted higher starting Period 5 and has stayed elevated; recent 20 periods are most relevant for forecasting. Therefore use promised lead time (default L=4) and compute demand forecast and volatility from the most recent 20 demand samples to capture the elevated regime while keeping responsiveness to recent variability.

Carry-over insight: Sustained actual lead_time=4 confirmed by concluded arrivals across Periods 5\u201340; demand regime increased starting Period 5 and has remained elevated (use recent 20 periods for forecasts).

Period 42 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-12-09). On-hand=1536, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent actual lead_time=4 (orders from Periods 1\u201340 concluded with LT=4). Demand regime rose starting Period 5 and stayed elevated for many periods, but recent weeks (Periods 33\u201341) show substantially lower sales activity compared with the mid-year peak. Given confirmed LT=4 and a shifted demand profile, use the promised/confirmed lead time and a forecast anchored on the most recent 20 periods to capture the current lower-demand behavior while retaining variance from the elevated months. High on-hand and zero in-transit mean no immediate replenishment required; parameters aim to reduce future order quantities to avoid holding cost while preserving service through the (1+L) coverage.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained actual lead_time=4 across concluded arrivals (Period 5 onward). Current on-hand is high (1536) with zero in-transit; recent demand (Periods 33\u201341) is lower than mid-year peaks\u2014use recent 20 periods for forecasting adjustments.

Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead_time=4 (arrivals from Periods 5\u201342 correspond to orders placed 4 periods earlier), so use promised/default lead time. Demand regime shifted up starting Period 5 and has since stabilized; recent demand (Periods 24\u201342) is lower than mid-year peaks, so use recent 20 periods to capture the current regime for both mean and volatility. Using recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat keeps forecasts responsive to the post-peak, lower-demand regime while L=default preserves the confirmed lead time for ordering decisions and avoids under-ordering given current high on-hand.

Period 44 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date=2019/12/23 (Period 44). Demand regime rose starting Period 5 but recent demand (Periods 33\u201343) is substantially lower than mid-year peaks. On-hand=1421, in-transit=0 (no outstanding shipments). Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead_time=4 \u2014 promised lead time is reliable. To avoid overstock given high on-hand and lower recent demand, use a forecast anchored to the most recent 20 periods. Set L to default (promised 4). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=20 so the OR engine computes (1+L)*recent mean and sqrt(1+L)*recent std; this reduces orders relative to full-sample averages and aligns safety stock to current lower volatility, balancing service level against holding cost.

Period 45 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019/12/30). Historical concluded arrivals confirm sustained actual lead_time=4. Demand regime rose starting Period 5 but recent demand (last ~20 periods) is lower than mid-year peaks; on-hand is high (1364) and in-transit=0 so immediate ordering urgency is low. Using recent 20-period demand for (1+L)-period forecast and volatility captures the current, lower post-peak regime while keeping L at the confirmed 4 to match observed arrivals. This reduces excess ordering while maintaining service given large on-hand stock.

Carry-over insight: On-hand inventory is high (1364) with zero in-transit as of Period 45 \u2014 deprioritize new orders until on-hand drawn down.
