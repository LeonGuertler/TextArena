Period 1 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (late Feb) \u2014 swimwear SKU with historical demands [61,98,152,129,213]. On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no concluded arrivals/history to infer lead-time. Use promised lead time and population statistics: set L=default so OR uses promised 4-period lead time; set mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This is conservative baseline ahead of rising spring demand while avoiding unsupported explicit adjustments given no arrival/conclude evidence.

Period 2 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/4 (Period 2). On-hand=0, in-transit=225 from Period 1 order (ordered=225 arrived=0 in Period 1 conclude) \u2014 shipment overdue but not yet confirmed lost. Demand history shows recent high variability (samples [61,98,152,129,213]; Period 1 demand=175). Given only one conclude with zero arrival, no reliable observed lead-time regime change is measurable yet. Use promised lead time (default) so OR backend uses its standard (1+L) scaling of historical mean/variance; this is conservative while we wait one more conclude to confirm loss or lead-time shift. Defaults keep parameters consistent with historical demand and let the capped ordering limit control order size given in-transit pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 1 order (225) did not arrive by Period 2 conclude (arrived=0) \u2014 possible lost/late shipment; monitor next conclude for confirmation.

Period 3 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 3). On-hand=0, in-transit=453 (orders from P1=225, P2=228) but no arrivals have concluded yet; Period 1 and 2 orders showed arrived=0 at their concludes, so actual lead time is still unobserved and shipments may be delayed or lost. Use promised lead time (default) because there are no concluded lead-time observations to compute an empirical L. For demand, historical samples mean=130.6; using default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) lets the OR backend apply its calibrated service-level formula while keeping pipeline cover for (1+L) periods. This is conservative given possible lost shipments and prevents overreacting to unresolved arrival behavior.

Period 4 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (2019-03-18). Recent demand samples = [61,98,152,129,213], mean=130.6. On-hand=0, in-transit=681 (equals orders 225+228+228), but no arrived conclures \u2192 no concluded lead-time observed; possible delayed/lost shipments but not yet confirmed. Use promised lead time (default) since conclude history provides no lead-time samples. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat to defaults so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level (covers L+1 periods) vs holding cost given uncertain arrivals.

Period 5 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/25 (Period 5). On-hand=0, in-transit=787 but four conclude messages (Periods 1\u20134) show ordered quantities repeatedly arriving=0 => strong evidence of delayed or lost shipments beyond promised lead time. Recent demand has been rising (Period1\u20134 demands: 175,173,181,200) and historical seed demands available. Because concludes show no arrivals, I treat lead time as longer than promised to avoid under-ordering. I set L explicitly longer than promised; for demand I use a recent-window forecast to capture the upward trend and a matching recent-window volatility estimate. These parameters bias orders upward to cover (1+L) periods of elevated recent demand and mitigate service-level loss from missing shipments while accepting increased holding cost risk.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed multi-period non-arrival: orders placed in Periods 1\u20134 all concluded as arrived=0 \u2192 probable lost/delayed shipments; treat lead time regime as extended until arrivals are observed.

Period 6 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 6). Recent concludes show multi-period non-arrivals until Period 5 when Period 1 order arrived with observed lead_time=4, confirming promised lead time. On-hand=0, in-transit=780 (pipeline large). Demand history samples [61,98,152,129,213] show mean \u2248130.6. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times to reflect confirmed actual lead time; mu_hat and sigma_hat use defaults so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample, keeping forecasting conservative given upstream disruption now resolved. This balances service level (use observed L=4) against holding cost given large pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed lead time regime = 4 periods (Period 1 order concluded in Period 5 with lead_time=4); earlier multi-period non-arrivals resolved by that arrival\u2014treat lead time as 4 until future concludes indicate change.

Period 7 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08 (Period 7). Recent concludes show actual lead time = 4 (Periods 1\u21925, 2\u21926). On-hand=0, in-transit=654 (multiple outstanding orders). Demand has accelerated in recent periods (conclude demands: 175,173,181,200,268,376). I set L to default (promised 4) consistent with observed regime. To capture the recent upward demand regime, I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 6 observed demands (N=6) so the (1+L)-period forecast and volatility reflect the latest spike; this balances service level during high demand while letting the OR backend cap orders via its cap constraint and holding cost tradeoff.

Period 8 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-15). Recent concludes show a stable actual lead time = 4 periods (Period 1\u2192arrived in Period 5, Periods 2\u20133 also 4). On-hand=0, in-transit=788 (these in-transit units cover multiple future periods). Historical demand samples available; no clear new demand regime or variance shift requiring recent-window adjustments. Use promised/confirmed lead time to let OR backend compute replenishment from full-sample stats; this balances service (covering L+1 periods) while avoiding overreacting to transient arrival noise.

Period 9 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-22). On-hand=0, in-transit=945. Concluded history shows consistent lead_time=4 for arrived orders (Period 5 concluded arrivals from Period1 with lead_time=4, subsequent concludes confirm 4). Demand has shifted up materially starting Period 5 (demands in Periods 5-8 = [268,376,295,367]) versus earlier samples. To capture the current high-demand regime I set L via calculate (use observed lead times average = 4). For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=4 to reflect the sustained higher-demand regime (computing (1+L)*mean over the last 4 periods). I set sigma_hat recent_N N=4 to reflect the volatility in the same recent regime. These parameters raise target base-stock to cover the (L+1)-period elevated demand while keeping variance estimate tied to recent variability, balancing service level against holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: sustained higher demand since Period 5 (Period5-8 demands = [268,376,295,367], mean\u2248326.5); treat recent regime as primary until future concludes indicate reversion. Lead-time regime: confirmed actual lead_time=4 from concluded arrivals (Periods 5-8).

Period 10 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:

All concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=4. Set L via calculate (use observed lead times average=4). Forecast demand across review+lead using recent 5 samples to capture the new higher-demand regime: mu_hat recent_N N=5. Capture recent volatility with sigma_hat recent_N N=5. This keeps orders responsive to the sustained demand increase while leveraging the confirmed 4-period lead time and existing in-transit stock to avoid excessive holding costs.

Period 11 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019/5/6). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 5 (demands Period5-10 = [268,376,295,367,477,468], recent mean elevated, changepoint at Period 5). Actual lead time has been confirmed = 4 periods by concluded arrivals. On-hand=0, in-transit=1531 (pipeline visible) \u2014 with L=4 we must cover (1+L)=5 periods of demand. To respond to the sustained higher demand while respecting confirmed lead time and avoiding stockouts, set L to the promised/confirmed value and base demand estimates on the recent regime. Chosen methods: L=default (promised lead time 4); mu_hat=recent_N with N=6 to capture the 6-period high-demand regime starting Period 5; sigma_hat=recent_N with N=6 to reflect recent elevated volatility. These parameters push the OR backend to raise the base-stock to meet the new demand regime while the recent_N volatility increases safety stock, balancing service level vs. holding cost. Monitor future conclude messages for any lead-time change or demand reversion.

Period 12 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-05-13). Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 5 (demands P5-11 = [268,376,295,367,477,468,332], mean\u2248372). On-hand=30, in-transit=1597 (ample pipeline). Observed concluded lead times are consistently 4 periods; use calculated average to reflect confirmed regime. For demand forecasting I use recent_N with N=7 (the entire post-changepoint regime P5\u2013P11) so mu_hat reflects the higher recent mean over the (1+L) review+lead horizon and sigma_hat uses recent_N with N=7 to capture recent volatility. This balances service (avoid stockouts during sustained high demand) against holding cost given large in-transit inventory; the OR backend will cap orders using its cap parameter.

Period 13 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-20). On-hand=0, in-transit=1630. Historical concludes show a stable actual lead_time=4 (orders placed in Periods 1-8 arrived with lead_time=4). Demand shifted up starting Period 5 (Period5-12 demands = [268,376,295,367,477,468,332,417], mean\u2248359.). I set L=default (promised 4, consistent with observed concludes). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=8 to capture the post-Period-5 high-demand regime (regime length=8 samples \u2192 N=8). These parameters bias the OR engine to hold more safety stock to cover the longer review+lead demand and higher variance while keeping holding cost in mind.

Period 14 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-27). Recent history shows confirmed actual lead_time=4 (concluded arrivals from orders in Periods 1\u20139 all indicate 4). Demand shifted up starting Period 5: Periods 5\u201313 demands = [268,376,295,367,477,468,332,417,370], mean \u2248 374.4. On-hand=45, in-transit=1534 (pipeline ample). Set L via calculate to reflect observed lead times (average observed = 4). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=9 to capture the sustained high-demand regime (use last 9 periods, Periods 5\u201313). This raises target base stock to cover (1+L) periods of the higher demand while sigma from same window captures elevated volatility; given large pipeline, this balances service level against holding cost without overreacting to older low-demand samples.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed lead_time=4 based on concluded arrivals (orders in Periods 1\u20139); Sustained higher demand regime since Period 5 with mean\u2248374.4 (Periods 5\u201313), treat as primary until evidence of reversion.

Period 15 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-06-03). Historical concludes consistently show actual lead_time=4 (orders from Periods 1\u201310 concluded with W=4). Demand has been in a sustained higher regime since Period 5 (Periods 5\u201313 mean\u2248374.4). On-hand=11, in-transit=1405 (pipeline large). Use promised/default L=4 to align with observed regime and OR expectations. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the post-changepoint regime (Periods 5\u201313, 9 samples) so the backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility based on the high-demand regime; this increases service level while the large pipeline limits immediate stockout risk and mitigates lost-shipment concerns.

Period 16 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-06-10). On-hand=109, in-transit=1503. Concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead_time=4 (orders placed Periods 1\u201311 concluded with W=4); earlier suspected losses resolved. Demand regime shifted up starting Period 5 (Periods 5\u201315 mean \u2248 374.4); use recent regime to set demand forecast and variability. Choices: L=default to rely on promised lead time=4 (matches observed concludes); mu_hat=recent_N with N=11 to forecast (1+L)\xd7mean over the sustained high-demand regime (Periods 5\u201315) so base stock reflects current elevated demand; sigma_hat=recent_N with N=11 to capture recent volatility. These parameters keep pipeline aligned with the 4-period lead time while raising target stock to avoid stockouts under the new higher demand, balancing profit vs holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

Period 17 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-17). Demand has been in a sustained higher regime since Period 5; recent rolling demand (Periods 5\u201316) is materially above early-sample baseline. All concluded arrivals show actual lead_time = 4 periods consistently. On-hand = 103, in-transit = 1593 \u2014 pipeline is large and reflects many outstanding 4-period orders. I set L based on observed concluded lead times (calculate) to lock in the confirmed 4-period regime. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=12 (Periods 5\u201316) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime while meeting the rule N = max(min(regime_length,20),3). This biases the base-stock and safety stock toward the new demand level, helping the OR engine balance service (avoid stockouts given long lead time) against holding cost given the large pipeline.

Period 18 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-06-24 (Period 18). Concluded history shows consistent arrivals with lead_time=4 (orders in Periods 1-13 concluded with W=4), so use calculated average lead time. Demand regime shifted up starting Period 5 and has remained elevated; recent regime length = Periods 5\u201317 (13 periods). On-hand=0, in-transit=1542 (covers multiple future periods). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=13 to capture the sustained higher demand and its volatility; this aims the base-stock toward the higher mean while sigma reflects recent variability. Using calculated L and recent demand stats balances service (avoid stockouts under higher demand) against holding cost given abundant pipeline.

Period 19 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-07-01). Recent history shows confirmed actual lead_time=4 (consistent across many concluded arrivals) and a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 5 (periods 5\u201318 show elevated demand; recent mean ~374 units). Current inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=1661 \u2014 substantial pipeline but demands remain high and volatile (several >400, a 771 peak). I set L to default (use promised lead time = 4) because concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=14 to capture the sustained high-demand regime (changepoint at Period 5, recent regime length = 14 periods). These parameters make the OR backend compute base-stock reflecting the elevated mean and higher variance while the cap limits order size per policy, letting in-transit cover several periods but avoiding excessive new orders given large pipeline.

To reflect the elevated demand profile and recent variance, keep promised lead time (default) and compute demand stats from the recent high-demand regime. Use recent_N with N=15 (Periods 5\u201319) so mu_hat and sigma_hat capture the post-changepoint mean/volatility; this raises the base-stock target to better cover (1+L) periods while the OR backend applies the capped order size.

Period 21 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-15). Demand has been in a sustained high regime since Period 5; observed concluded lead times are consistently 4 periods. On-hand=0, in-transit=1880 (covers several future periods given high demand). I set L by 'calculate' to use observed lead-time data (avg observed = 4). For demand I use recent_N with N=16 to capture the high-demand regime from Period 5 onward (regime length \u224816 periods through Period 20) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean of last 16 samples; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=16 to capture volatility in the same recent regime. These choices align the base-stock target to current high-demand regime while respecting the confirmed 4-period lead time and existing pipeline to reduce stockouts without excessive holding cost.

Period 22 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-22). Demand has been in a sustained high regime since Period 5; confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods from concluded arrivals. On-hand=0, in-transit=2032 (covers multiple future periods). I set L using observed lead times (calculate) to reflect confirmed lead_time=4. For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=17 (Periods 5\u201321) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (mean \u2248 440 units over that window) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7recent mean. sigma_hat uses default (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) so backend captures overall volatility. These choices bias orders upward to meet the elevated demand while honoring confirmed lead time and letting the OR engine balance service level vs holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Sustained elevated demand regime persists through Period 21: Periods 5\u201321 demands sum=7459, mean\u2248440 (use recent regime as primary until evidence of reversion).

To capture the elevated mean and volatility I use recent_N with N=18 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the recent high-demand regime. This balances service (protect against stockouts under higher demand) vs holding cost by targeting parameters derived from the persistent post-changepoint demand.

Period 24 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/5 (Period 24). Demand has run at an elevated regime since Period 5; recent periods (5\u201321) show mean \u2248440 units/period and pipeline arrivals consistently confirm actual lead_time=4. Current inventory: on-hand=234, in-transit=1863 (sufficient pipeline). To align the OR backend with the observed high-demand regime and confirmed lead time, I use promised/default lead time and set demand estimates using recent regime data (avoids diluting with early low-demand samples). This balances service (meet high demand) against holding cost because on-hand + in-transit already cover much of the (1+L) demand; recent_N captures current mean/volatility for appropriate base_stock sizing.

Period 25 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-08-12): historical concludes confirm actual lead_time=4 and a sustained elevated demand regime since Period 5. On-hand=646 + in-transit=1619 provides cushion but demand remains high; keep lead time = promised to match observed regime. Use recent_N demand estimates to capture the elevated regime (Periods 5\u201321, regime length 17) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand based on the recent high-demand samples and matches volatility. This balances higher service needs vs holding cost given current large pipeline.

Period 26 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-19). Demand has been in a sustained elevated regime since Period 5; concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead_time = 4. On-hand=934, in-transit=1351 \u2014 pipeline looks healthy but demand remains high so keep lead_time=4. Set L explicitly to 4 (confirmed by multiple concluded arrivals). Use recent_N demand estimates to capture the elevated regime (use N=20 covering the most recent stable regime). This balances service (higher mu_hat to avoid stockouts under high demand) against holding cost by using recent data rather than all-time mean; sigma_hat recent_N captures current volatility for safety stock sizing.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead_time=4 based on concluded arrivals (Period 5 onward); sustained elevated demand regime since Period 5 (use recent regime for forecasting; regime_length\u224821, use N=20).

Concluded history confirms actual lead_time=4 (consistent since Period 5) and a sustained elevated demand regime since Period 5; use recent regime for forecasting.

Period 28 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 28). Historical concludes consistently confirm actual lead_time=4 since Period 6 onward and demand has remained in a sustained elevated regime since Period 5. On-hand=1495, in-transit=606 \u2014 strong coverage but OR needs demand forecast over review+lead. I set L=default to use the promised lead time (4) which matches observed concluded lead times. For demand I use recent_N with N=20 (captures the sustained high-demand regime since Period 5; carry-over guidance recommended N=20). For volatility I also use recent_N N=20 so the backend sizes safety stock to the recent elevated variance. These choices keep the model responsive to the prolonged high-demand regime while relying on the confirmed lead-time behavior to avoid underordering despite past lost/late shipments.

Period 29 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-09-09). Historical concludes confirm actual lead_time=4 and a sustained elevated demand regime since Period 5 (recent periods show much higher weekly demand vs early samples). On-hand=1761 + in-transit=371 provides large coverage now, but elevated demand regime (regime_length\u224821) warrants forecasting using the recent regime. I set L to default (promised lead time = 4, confirmed by concludes). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (N=20 chosen per carry-over guidance: use up to 20 and regime_length\u224821). These parameters steer the OR backend to size base stock around the recent higher mean while reflecting recent volatility, balancing service level (avoid stockouts under elevated demand) against holding cost given current ample inventory.

Period 30 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-16): demand has remained in an elevated regime since Period 5 (sustained high weekly swimwear demand through summer). On-hand=1848, in-transit=239 \u2014 ample coverage vs. short-term demand but we must respect actual lead_time=4 (confirmed by concluded arrivals). Set L to promised/confirmed 4 to match observed arrivals. Use recent_N N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained elevated demand regime (regime_length\u224821; cap N=20) so the OR base-stock reflects the higher mean and volatility observed since Period 5 while avoiding older low-demand samples.

Current inventory: on-hand=1818, in-transit=239 (pipeline healthy). To match the confirmed LT=4 and the sustained higher-demand regime, set L to promised (4) and use recent_N (N=20) for demand forecast and volatility so the OR backend targets the elevated recent mean/variance (caps will limit excessive single-period orders).

Period 32 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-30). Historical concludes confirm actual lead_time=4 and a sustained elevated demand regime since Period 5 (recent rolling mean ~440 over Periods 5\u201321; regime persisted through later periods). On-hand=1893 and in-transit=129 \u2014 ample current coverage, but continue using the recent high-demand regime to size future orders and maintain service. Set L to promised/default (confirmed =4). Use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained elevated-demand regime (N=20 per carry-over guidance). This balances high service level (higher forecast) against holding cost given large on-hand stock; backend cap will limit excessive orders.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead_time=4 from concluded arrivals (Periods 5 onward); sustained elevated demand regime since Period 5 (use recent regime, regime_length\u224821, use N=20).

Period 33 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-07 (Period 33). On-hand=1940, in-transit=20. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead_time=4 since Period 5 and demand has remained in a sustained elevated regime since Period 5 (regime_length\u224821). To match observed regime and ensure pipeline covers review+lead demand, set lead time explicitly to 4. Use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend uses the most recent elevated-demand regime for (1+L)-period forecast and volatility estimates, aligning safety stock with current demand variability.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead_time=4 from concluded arrivals (Periods 5 onward); sustained elevated demand regime since Period 5 (regime_length\u224821) \u2014 use recent_N=20 for forecasting until evidence of reversion.

Period 35 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21 (Period 35). Historical concludes confirm actual lead_time=4 and a sustained elevated demand regime since Period 5 (regime_length\u224821). On-hand=1879, in-transit=0 \u2014 no arrivals expected before four periods after any new order. To match the confirmed lead-time and recent elevated demand, use the recent_N=20 demand estimate so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current high-demand regime and keep service high while controlling holding cost. No evidence of new lead-time change, so keep L=default (promised=4).

Period 37 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-11-04). Actual lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods since concluded arrivals (Periods 5 onward). Recent demand regime is elevated and persistent since Period 5; use recent_N=20 to capture the elevated mean/volatility. On-hand=1793, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample on-hand relative to forecasted (1+L) demand given elevated regime, so avoid extra ordering risk. Choices: L=default (use promised 4 which matches observed); mu_hat=recent_N with N=20 to base (1+L) forecast on most recent 20 demand samples from the sustained high-demand regime; sigma_hat=recent_N with N=20 to reflect recent volatility and set safety stock appropriately. These parameters keep service high while avoiding unnecessary holding by aligning forecasts to the confirmed high-demand, LT=4 regime and current large on-hand position.

Period 38 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-11-11). On-hand=1759, in-transit=0. Historical concludes consistently confirm actual lead_time=4 since Period 5; demand has remained in a sustained elevated regime since Period 5 (use recent regime for forecasts). To protect service with confirmed L=4 and high on-hand, set L=default (promised 4). Use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained elevated demand regime (regime_length\u224821; cap N to 20). This biases the OR base-stock toward recent higher mean and volatility, improving fill rates while acknowledging holding cost given large on-hand balance.

Period 39 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-18). Demand has been in a sustained elevated regime since Period 5; recent low-variance weekly demands (Periods 19\u201338) show much lower values than early-season peaks but the long-run elevated regime from Periods 5+ remains the best predictor. All concluded arrivals from Period 5 onward confirm actual lead_time = 4 periods. On-hand = 1717, in-transit = 0 \u2014 ample on-hand now but future ordering must respect L=4 and elevated demand regime. Choices: set L to default (use promised 4); set mu_hat using recent_N with N=20 to capture the sustained post-change regime; set sigma_hat using recent_N N=20 to reflect recent demand volatility. This balances service (using recent elevated mean) against holding cost given large on-hand inventory and confirmed lead time.

Period 40 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/25 (Period 40). Recent history shows a clear demand downshift starting around Period 30: Periods 30\u201339 demands = [30,35,62,38,43,50,36,34,42,17], mean\u224839.7. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded messages. I set L to default (promised lead time = 4). For forecasting I use recent_N on the most recent low-demand regime (N=10, the regime length) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect current lower sales and reduce excess ordering given large on-hand (1700) and zero in-transit. This reduces holding cost while maintaining service for the new lower-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: New: Demand regime shifted down starting ~Period 30; Periods 30\u201339 mean\u224839.7 (use recent_N forecasting on this regime).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-1361.00

Period 41 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/02 (Period 41). Lead-time history: concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4 since Period 5 \u2192 treat L\u22484. Demand regime: sustained high demand through Period 5\u201329 then a clear downshift starting ~Period 30 (Periods 30\u201339 mean \u224839.7); Period 40 had a one-off spike (113) but recent window still shows lower demand. On-hand=1587, in-transit=0 so pipeline is empty. Decisions: use calculated lead time from observed conclusions to lock L=4 (stable evidence). Forecast (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) should use the recent low-demand regime to avoid overstocking; apply recent_N over the most recent regime (Periods 30\u201340, regime_length\u224811) so N=11. This keeps ordered quantity aligned with current lower demand and reduces holding cost while maintaining service given ample on-hand inventory.

Carry-over insight: New sustained lower-demand regime beginning ~Period 30 (Periods 30\u201339 mean\u224839.7); use recent_N forecasting on this regime until evidence of reversion.

Period 42 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:

Demand regime shifted down around Period 30 (Periods 30\u201341 mean\u224839.7) \u2014 use a recent-regime estimate to avoid overstock. Chosen methods: L by "calculate" to lock in observed average lead time from concluded arrivals; mu_hat and sigma_hat by "recent_N" with N=12 (covering Periods 30\u201341) so (1+L)-period forecast and volatility reflect the new low-demand regime. This keeps orders modest given large on-hand stock and no pipeline, reducing holding cost while maintaining service for current low demand.

Carry-over insight: New sustained lower-demand regime beginning ~Period 30 (Periods 30\u201341 mean\u224839.7); use recent-regime forecasting (N=12) until evidence of reversion.

Period 43 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16 (Period 43). History shows actual lead_time settled at 4 periods (concluded arrivals consistent). Demand has shifted to a sustained lower regime beginning ~Period 30 (Periods 30\u201342 demands mean \u2248 39.7). On-hand = 1479, in-transit = 0 \u2192 ample stock now; avoid aggressive replenishment. Set L to promised/observed 4 to match concluded lead-times. Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the recent low-demand regime (regime length = 13 periods, N=13) so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)-period demand and variance using current low-demand behavior, which reduces target base-stock and holding cost risk while preserving service for the current regime.

Period 44 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/23 (Period 44). Inventory is high (on-hand=1421, in-transit=0). Lead-time regime has been consistently confirmed as 4 periods by concluded arrivals since Period 5 \u2192 use promised/default lead time. Demand regime shifted down around Period 30 (Periods 30\u201341 mean\u224839.7); recent lower-demand regime is the primary signal. To align ordering with the current low-demand regime and avoid excess holding cost, use recent_N forecasting on the recent low-demand regime (N=12) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes base_stock and cap from the recent volatility and mean. This keeps orders conservative given large on-hand stock and no in-transit units.

Carry-over insight: New sustained lower-demand regime beginning ~Period 30 (Periods 30\u201341 mean\u224839.7); use recent-regime forecasting (N=12) until evidence of reversion.
