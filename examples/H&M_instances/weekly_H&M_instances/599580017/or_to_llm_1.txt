Current on-hand = 70, in-transit = 0, so any order placed now will arrive and be available for Period 27 demand. Demand assessment: recent demand has cooled sharply from earlier peaks. Periods 24\u201326 demands = 176, 132, 155 (3-period avg = 154). Earlier spikes were temporary (multiple large orders and sellouts) but the last three periods show much lower sustained demand. OR's recommendation (418) is driven by older high-demand samples and the promised lead time; it overestimates near-term demand. Objective trade-off: profit = $4/unit, holding = $1/unit/period implies a fractile favoring some safety stock but holding costs are material; with lead time = 0 we can replenish within-period, so we should avoid excessive inventory. Decision rule: target near short-term expected demand + small safety buffer. Take 3-period avg \u2248 154; add modest buffer of ~5% (\u22488 units) to protect against slight upside and round conservatively. Final order = 160 units. This yields available inventory \u2248230 for the period, limiting stockouts while avoiding large holding cost from a 400+ order. ",
