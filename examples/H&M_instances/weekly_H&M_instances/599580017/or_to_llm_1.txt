Given current on-hand=0, in-transit=0, and typical winter seasonality reducing swimwear demand, ordering to cover about one period (L+1=1) plus small safety stock is appropriate. OR recommended 321 (based on older/higher-demand history) \u2014 I reduce that sharply to reflect the sustained low-demand regime and to avoid holding costs.

{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: concluded history shows actual lead_time = 0 (orders arrive same period). Inventory & demand analysis: on-hand = 3, in-transit = 0. Recent realized demand has strongly downshifted; Periods 33\u201340 single-period mean \u224848, std \u224828, so expect ~48 units this period.
