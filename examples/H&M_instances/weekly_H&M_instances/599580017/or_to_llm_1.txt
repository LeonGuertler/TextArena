Period 45 (2019/12/30) Hybrid Decision:
============================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead time: confirmed = 4 periods historically; no concluded arrivals recently, but previous confirmations hold. Demand: recent sustained low-demand regime since Periods 31\u201335 (avg \u224845 units/period) has persisted through Periods 36\u201344 (sales mostly 36\u2013113, recently ~57). Inventory: on-hand=1635, in-transit=0 \u2192 current stock vastly exceeds near-term demand (5-period target \u22485\xd745=225). Holding cost is $1/unit/period and profit $2/unit, so excess inventory is costly. OR recommends 0 units; given confirmed low-demand regime and large on-hand buffer, ordering would increase holding cost with little benefit. Final decision: place 0 units to let on-hand draw down toward the ~225 target before replenishing.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Ordering 0 (follow OR) \u2014 on-hand=1635 far exceeds the 5-period low-demand target (~225) after a sustained post-season drop, so avoid extra holding cost.",
