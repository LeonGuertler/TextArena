Pipeline (718) >> required coverage, so no immediate replenishment needed. Lead time has been inconsistent historically (1\u20133 periods) but we already have ample pipeline; placing more inventory risks unnecessary holding cost ($1/unit/period) which reduces R_t more than expected marginal profit ($2/unit) given low winter swimwear demand. OR recommended 124 units based on historical averages and promised lead time; I override and order 0 to avoid overstock while current pipeline is sufficient to meet expected demand for many periods. Action: order 0 units.",
