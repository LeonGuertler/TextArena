Decision logic: Recent observed demand in Period 1 was high (175) and historical samples include a large value (213), so downside risk of severe stockouts over the (L+1)=5-period horizon is material. However holding cost is high relative to profit (holding=$1 vs profit=$2), and we already have 225 units in pipeline arriving after several periods \u2014 ordering aggressively beyond OR's cap would raise holding cost and risk if demand softens or shipments arrive earlier/later. We also have no concluded arrivals yet, so cannot safely assume pipeline is lost.

This balances the recent high demand signal against holding cost and the capped smoothing intended to limit over-ordering.",

Reasoning: with L=4 we must cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand after ordering; at current low-demand regime a 5-period demand \u2248 5\xd7~40\u201360 = 200\u2013300 units. On-hand (1734) >> required 5-period demand, so no replenishment needed. Ordering would incur holding cost $1/unit/period on excess inventory while profit per unit is $2 only realized when sold; reducing ordering preserves cash and avoids further holding cost. Risk check: supplier lead time is stable at 4, no in-transit to arrive, but current inventory buffer is large enough to cover lead time. Action: place 0 units, matching OR. ",
