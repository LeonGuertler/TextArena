Observations and judgement: recent demand shows an upward shift (last three periods: 152,129,213, average \u2248164.7 vs historical mean 130.6 \u2192 ~26% higher), and seasonality favors rising swimwear demand late Feb heading into spring/summer. With zero pipeline and a long lead time (4 periods), under-ordering risks stockouts across the lead+current period. I therefore increase OR's capped recommendation moderately rather than matching the full base_stock (which would create high holding cost). Action chosen = 281 units (\u2248+25% over OR) to buffer observed upward trend while keeping inventory exposure limited given lead-time uncertainty. No concluded arrivals exist to suggest lost shipments or lead-time deviation, so no change to lead-time assumption.",

Recent realized demand is high: Period1 demand=175, Period2=173; this is materially above the older 5-sample mean (~130.6). I therefore treat the near-term single-period demand as ~174 units. Requirement: orders + on-hand + in-transit should cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand because current-period demand occurs after decision. 5 * 174 \u2248 870 units total needed in pipeline/on-hand to hit the review+lead coverage. Pipeline currently 281, on-hand 0, so order \u2248 870 - 281 = 589 units.
