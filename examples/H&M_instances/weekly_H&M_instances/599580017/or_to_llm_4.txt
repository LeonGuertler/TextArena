Demand analysis: recent periods show a sustained weakened/off-season regime\u2014Periods 36\u201343 demands = [36,34,42,17,113,51,57,58] with a recent typical demand \u224850 units/week (Periods 36\u201341 mean \u224848.8; latest weeks 51,57,58). OR baseline (321) uses older high-demand samples and promised L, so it overestimates current need. Cost tradeoff: profit=$2, holding=$1 implies modest safety stock (critical fractile ~0.667), and holding cost is high relative to expected short-run demand, so avoid large inventory. Decision: place a conservative order to cover one period of expected demand plus small safety (\u224850\u201360).

OR baseline (314) uses long-run/higher-demand history and thus vastly overestimates current demand.
