Economics: Profit $2/unit vs holding $1/unit/period \u2014 carrying large inventory is costly. Decision logic: With ~55\u201360 expected weekly demand and long confirmed lead time, existing on-hand covers many periods (1088 / ~58 \u2248 18\u201319 weeks). To minimize holding costs while meeting service, place no order now and monitor demand; only replenish when on-hand + in-transit falls to cover ~(L+1) periods of demand given any upward shifts.",
