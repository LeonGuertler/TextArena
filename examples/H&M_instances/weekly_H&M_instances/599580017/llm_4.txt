Final order logic: do not place any order this period to avoid additional holding cost and because lead time=4 means any order would arrive when low-season persists. Monitor demand; only reorder when on-hand + in-transit falls near (L+1)*expected demand.",

{
  "rationale": "World/calendar: Period 45 = 2019-12-30 (post-peak swimwear season, holiday week). Demand regime: recent periods 40\u201344 = [113,51,57,58,57] => demand \u224860 units/period (low-season). Lead time: historically confirmed = 4 periods (multiple concluded arrivals); no new arrival evidence to contradict. Inventory/pipeline: on-hand=1658, in-transit=0. Coverage check: with L=4 need on-hand+in-transit to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand \u22485*60=300 units; current on-hand >> required. Risk: ordering now would arrive after 4 periods into continuing low-demand season and incur $1 holding cost/period, reducing objective. Final order logic: place no order to avoid excess holding cost while on-hand inventory comfortably covers multi-period demand and lead time.",
