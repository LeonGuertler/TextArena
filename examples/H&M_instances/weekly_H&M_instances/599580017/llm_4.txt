Product is a women's swimwear bottom, seasonally relevant now. Historical unified samples for SKU 599580017 = [61,98,152,129,213]; recent values show an upward-skewed seasonal pattern (mean \u2248 130). Promised lead time = 4 periods, so orders placed now must cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand because current-period demand occurs after ordering and arrivals occur only in Period N+4. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so pipeline is empty. To avoid stockouts during the multi-period lead time and upcoming seasonal ramp, order to cover 5 periods of expected demand: 5 \xd7 130 \u2248 650 units. This balances service level for a seasonal SKU against holding cost ($1/unit/period) and profit ($4/unit). No concluded arrival data exists to infer actual lead time or lost shipments.",

Inventory/pipeline: On-hand=0, In-transit=650 (ordered P1). Promised lead time=4; use L+1=5 periods coverage when ordering. If true demand is near recent 175, required coverage = 175*5 = 875 units. Current pipeline (650) covers ~130/unit per period (650/5). Shortfall \u2248 875-650 = 225. If demand is closer to long-run average ~131, required = 131*5=655, pipeline adequate (650 vs 655 slight shortfall). To balance holding cost ($1) vs stockouts and given early signs of increased demand and seasonality, choose a conservative replenishment to cover moderate uplift. I therefore order an additional 150 units to raise total pipeline+order to 800, which covers ~160 units/period over 5 periods (between long-run avg and recent high) while avoiding excessive holding cost.",
