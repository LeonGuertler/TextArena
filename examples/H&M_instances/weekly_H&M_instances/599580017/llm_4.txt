Sample mean \u2248130 units/period with notable upward tail (213). c) Lead time & missing orders: Supplier promised lead time = 2 periods.

With lead time L=2, decision must cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand because arrivals occur after decision and during future periods. e) Final order logic: Use prior mean \u2248130 units/period. To cover 3 periods conservatively for an expected seasonal ramp, order 3 * 130 = 390 units. This balances service (avoid stockouts into spring ramp) against holding cost; will update in future periods as arrivals/actual demand clarify.",
