  "rationale": "a) World/product: SKU is women's swimwear bottoms. Date 2019-02-25 => Northern Hemisphere moving into spring; swimwear demand typically rises into spring/summer and around holiday/weekend beach seasons. b) Demand regime: historical unified samples [61,98,152,129,213] show an upward/skewed series with mean \u2248130 and recent values higher (152,129,213) => upward bias vs. small-sample baseline. c) Lead time / missing orders: Promised lead time=4 periods. No concluded arrivals yet (no history of arrivals), so actual lead time unknown; treat supplier as 4-period lead time and guard for potential delays or lost shipments. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, In-transit=0. With lead time L=4, we must cover current period plus next 4 (L+1=5) periods of demand when ordering. e) Final order logic: Use elevated demand forecast to reflect seasonality and recent higher observations. Forecast per-period \u2248150 units (above historical mean to be conservative for seasonality). Order = forecast*(L+1) - (on-hand + in-transit) = 150*5 - 0 = 750; to moderate holding cost vs. risk, place slightly lower buffer: 700 units.",
