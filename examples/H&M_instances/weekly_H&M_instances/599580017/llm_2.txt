No on-hand or in-transit inventory and no lead-time evidence yet (no concluded arrivals), so actual lead time is unknown and orders could be delayed or lost. Given high holding cost ($1) vs profit ($4) and still-early season (late Feb), I balance risk of stockouts against holding cost by placing a moderate starter replenishment to capture rising spring demand while limiting inventory risk and allowing us to observe arrival/lead-time behavior.
