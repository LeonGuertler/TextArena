Date 2019-02-25 is late Feb \u2014 demand typically rises heading into spring break and spring/summer seasons, so expect above-average demand in upcoming periods. b) Demand regime analysis: historical unified samples for this SKU = [61,98,152,129,213], mean \u2248131 units/period. No recent on-shelf history to indicate a regime shift, so use the sample mean as base demand forecast. c) Lead_time vs missing orders: Supplier promised lead time = 4 periods. No prior orders placed, no concluded arrivals to infer actual lead time; treat lead time = 4 for planning and allow for possible delivery loss risk. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Because arrivals occur only in Period N+4 (visible later), any order placed now will not help current-period demand. e) Final order logic: Need coverage for (L+1)=5 periods of demand (current period's demand occurs after decision). Forecast 131 units/period \xd75 = 655 units. Balancing profit ($2/unit) vs holding cost ($1/unit/period), and given strong seasonality for swimwear, place an order to cover the 5-period pipeline demand: 655 units.",
