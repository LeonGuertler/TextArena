Recent demand shows uptick: last three periods [152,129,213] avg\u2248164.7 (+26% vs full-sample mean 130.6), suggesting stronger demand heading into spring for swimwear (date 2019-02-25). Given high profit vs holding (favors stocking) and the significant recent upward signal, I increase order above the OR cap to reduce stockout risk through the 3-period protection window (current + 2-period lead). Actual lead time is unobserved; follow conservative uplift (not full base_stock) to balance holding cost.\n3) Final action: order 270 units (20% above OR's 225). This captures the recent demand rise while limiting excess holding cost relative to the uncapped base_stock (~475).\n4) Risk notes: If future concluded arrivals show lead time longer/shorter or shipments lost, adjust aggressively next periods. No concluded messages yet to change lead-time belief.\n",

Demand & forecast: carry-over insight indicates a sustained high-demand regime since Period 6 with average \u2248466 units/period. With L=3, review+lead horizon is (L+1)=4 periods so target pipeline = 4 \xd7 466 = 1,864 units. Current coverage = on-hand 45 + in-transit 1,665 = 1,710 units. Shortfall = 1,864 \u2212 1,710 = 154 units. Decision: place order to cover the 4-period shortfall (154 units). This aligns with the OR's intent to target multi-period demand but corrects for the observed actual lead time=3 and the sustained high-demand regime. Inventory/holding tradeoff: profit $4 vs holding $1 implies higher service level, so we fill the modest shortfall rather than risking lost sales. No additional increase beyond the calculated shortfall because substantial pipeline already exists and ordering more would raise holding costs unnecessarily.",
