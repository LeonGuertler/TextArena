Assessment: no concluded arrivals exist to suggest lead-time differs or shipments lost; seasonally (late Feb) swimwear may begin to ramp but evidence is limited and holding cost is high relative to profit (holding = $1 vs profit = $2), so avoid aggressive over-ordering.

OR recommends 228 (uses promised L and its cap \u2248225) but that leaves pipeline+order \u2248453 which is well below \u03bc\u0302. Risk assessment: If the in-transit 225 arrives as promised we still face a large shortfall vs expected demand (653). If some in-transit units are lost/delayed, shortfall is larger. Recent observed demand (Period1 demand=175) is above the historical mean, indicating demand may be higher than baseline. Decision logic: We should target pipeline (on-hand + in-transit + new order) \u2248 expected (L+1)-period demand \u03bc\u0302 \u2248653 to avoid stockouts and maximize sales (profit > holding cost per unit sold).

I override OR's capped recommendation upward because OR's cap (\u2248225) assumes the pipeline is healthy and uses only promised L; current pipeline is insufficient to cover (L+1) periods and recent demand is elevated.
