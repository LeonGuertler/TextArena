Lead time & pipeline: supplier promised LT=2 but historical concludes vary 1\u20133; multiple recent shipments have long LTs, so risk of delayed arrivals exists. Inventory assessment: on-hand=392, in-transit=1243 (large pipeline). Decision rule: with promised LT=2 (plan for L+1=3 periods) and current low demand (~120\u2013140/week) on-hand alone covers ~2.8\u20133.3 weeks; plus substantial in-transit reduces stockout risk. Holding cost ($1) is high vs profit ($4), so avoid adding inventory while demand is low and pipeline is large. Action: do not order this period to avoid excess holding cost and because current inventory + in-transit sufficiently covers near-term demand.",
