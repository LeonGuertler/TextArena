Lead time: supplier promised 4 periods; no concluded arrivals yet, so treat as 4 until contrary evidence. Pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=0, so no coverage. Policy: to avoid stockouts given L=4, target coverage = (L+1)=5 periods of expected demand. Demand multiplier for seasonal ramp and volatility => use mean demand (130.6) as base and add modest safety for variance (+5%). Calculation: 130.6 * 5 * 1.05 \u2248 684.
