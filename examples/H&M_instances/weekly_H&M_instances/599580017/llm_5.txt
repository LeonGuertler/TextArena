No concluded arrivals or lead-time evidence yet (on-hand=0, in-transit=0). Risk: supplier promised lead_time=0 but actual lead time unknown; conservative assumption is that same-period arrivals are not guaranteed, so we must cover current period demand from pipeline (order may arrive late). Cost tradeoff: unit profit $4, holding $1/period \u2014 over-ordering reduces net reward. Action logic: target expected period demand \u2248 mean 131, round to a practical integer and avoid excessive safety stock given holding cost and no evidence of lost shipments.
