Period 1 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Product is seasonal swimwear but current date (late Feb) is pre-spring; demand history shows recent variability with mean demand = 130.6 units per period (samples [61,98,152,129,213]) and sizable std (~51). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so no arrivals visible; promised lead time=4 and no concluded arrivals to suggest different actual lead time. Use default lead time (promised L=4) and default demand/volatility estimates (use all samples) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples)=5\xd7130.6 and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples). This balances service (protects against observed demand spikes) while avoiding aggressive overstock given holding cost=$1 vs profit=$2.

Period 2 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04 (Period 2). Recent demand samples = [61,98,152,129,213], mean=130.6 units. Promised lead time is 4; no arrivals have concluded yet (Period 1 order of 225 shows arrived=0) so actual lead time is unobserved \u2014 treat as promised. On-hand=0, in-transit=225 (covers part of expected demand over lead+review). Use default demand estimates to let OR backend compute base-stock conservatively from full-sample mean and variance: (1+L)*mean = 5*130.6 = 653 expected demand across review+lead. This keeps orders aligned with historical average while avoiding premature adjustments due to the unconfirmed late arrival. No evidence yet of lost shipment or lead-time regime change.

Period 3 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019-03-11). Recent demand history shows mean ~130.6 units (samples [61,98,152,129,213]). On-hand=0, in-transit=453 (orders placed in P1+P2). No 'arrived' confirmations in conclude messages yet \u2014 cannot reliably infer actual lead time. Use promised lead time (default) so OR backend uses L=4 and standard aggregate demand estimates across (1+L) periods. Default mu_hat/sigma_hat keep forecast and safety stock aligned with historical mean/variance while the in-transit pipeline is monitored; this balances service level (avoid stockouts given sizable pipeline) against holding cost.

Carry-over insight: P1\u2013P2 orders (225, 228) remain unconcluded as of Period 3 conclude \u2192 possible shipment delay; monitor for lost shipments if no arrival confirmations by expected lead-time windows.

Period 4 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (2019-03-18). Recent demands: [61,98,152,129,213], mean=130.6. On-hand=0, in-transit=681 which matches outstanding orders (225+228+228) that remain unconcluded \u2192 possible shipment delays but no concluded lead-time observed yet. Use promised lead time to avoid over-adjusting while shipments are still possible. Set L=default (promised 4). Use mu_hat=default to anchor forecast to full (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples (5\xd7130.6=653 aggregate demand over review+lead). Use sigma_hat=default so backend computes sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service level (cover 5 periods of demand) against holding cost while we await arrival confirmations; if shipments fail to conclude in upcoming periods, switch to explicit L and reduce forecast.

Period 5 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-25). Recent on-hand=0, in-transit=787 (sum of P1\u2013P4 orders). Historical demand samples available; recent concluded demands (Periods1\u20134) show strong demand (175,173,181,200) but all placed orders are still in-transit and not yet concluded \u2014 consistent with promised lead time=4 (no confirmed late arrivals yet). To avoid overreacting to unconcluded shipments (could be normal lead-time lag), use default lead-time and demand aggregation so the OR backend applies the promised L and full-sample stats. Defaults balance service level vs holding cost given current high pipeline and zero on-hand inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $450.00

Period 6 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 6). Recent concludes show large unmet demand (period demands high; last conclude sold 225 of 268) and confirmed arrival: Period 5 conclude reported 225 units that were ordered on Period 1 with lead_time=4. On-hand=0, in-transit=591 \u2014 several earlier orders remain in pipeline with some previously unconcluded but at least one order confirmed with W=4. Given confirmed lead time=4 (matches promised), use default lead time to keep OR aligned with supplier promise. Use default demand aggregation (all samples) for mu_hat and default volatility for sigma_hat to let the OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the full sample set; this is appropriate because we have limited evidence of a persistent demand regime shift beyond naturally high recent demands, and defaults avoid overfitting to a short recent spike. These parameter choices aim to rebuild stock to cover review+lead periods while letting the backend calibrate safety stock vs holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (evidence: Period 5 conclude: arrived=225 units ordered on Period 1, lead_time was 4).

Period 7 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08 (Period 7). Recent concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 (Period 5 conclude: arrival from P1 with lead_time=4; Period 6 conclude: arrival from P2 with lead_time=4). Demand has accelerated sharply in recent periods (recent demands: 175,173,181,200,268,376 vs earlier historical samples), indicating a positive demand regime change; recent data should drive forecasts. To capture the confirmed L=4 and the recent uptick, set L via calculate (uses observed lead times), and use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat to emphasize the most recent demand regime (N=5 balances recency and sample size). This raises target base-stock to improve service while sigma_hat recent_N captures elevated volatility. These choices mitigate lost-shipment risk (by acknowledging true lead time) and prioritize service given profit/holding tradeoff.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (evidence: Period 5 conclude: arrived=225 ordered on Period 1, lead_time=4; Period 6 conclude: arrived=228 ordered on Period 2, lead_time=4). Recent demand regime increase since Period 1\u20134 with larger demands in Periods 5\u20136 (268,376) \u2014 treat as sustained uptick until contradicted.

Period 8 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/15 (Period 8). Historical concludes show consistent actual lead time = 4 (orders from P1\u2013P3 concluded with W=4). Recent demand regime increased beginning Period 5 (demands 268, 376, 295); I treat this uptick as the current regime. Set L by calculate to reflect observed lead times (average of observed W=4). For mu_hat use recent_N with N=3 to capture the higher recent mean demand (Periods 5\u20137). For sigma_hat use recent_N with N=3 to reflect recent demand volatility. These choices raise the base-stock to cover the sustained uptick while keeping variability estimates focused on the recent regime; using observed L avoids under-ordering given prior shipment delays.

Period 9 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-22). Observed history shows consistent concluded lead_times = 4 (Period 5 conclude: P1 lead_time=4; Period 6 conclude: P2 lead_time=4; Period 7/8 similar), so set L by calculating observed lead times. Demand has a clear upshift starting Period 5: recent demands = [268,376,295,367] \u2192 use recent regime to forecast. On-hand=0, in-transit=1078 (pipeline large but with high recent demand this covers only ~3.3 periods of demand at the recent mean), so set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the last 4 periods to capture the sustained uptick and higher volatility. These choices raise target base stock to reduce lost sales while sigma_hat recent_N captures higher variability; using observed L ensures timing aligns with actual arrivals.

Period 10 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/29 (Period 10). Observed concluded arrivals show consistent actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple concluded messages with lead_time=4). Demand has shifted up starting Period 5 (period demands: 268, 376, 295, 367, 477) \u2014 a sustained higher-demand regime. To cover review+lead demand and reflect the recent uptick, set L based on observed lead times and use recent_N=5 for demand estimates (captures Periods 5\u20139 high demands). This increases base_stock to improve service while sigma from the same recent window captures increased volatility. No evidence of lost shipments since arrivals have concluded at lead_time=4.

Period 11 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-05-06). On-hand=0, in-transit=1599 (pipeline matches outstanding orders; no new lost-shipment signals; concluded history shows consistent actual lead time=4). Demand has shifted up starting Period 5 (periods 5\u201310 demands = [268,376,295,367,477,468]); I detect a changepoint at Period 5 and treat the recent regime (6 periods) as representative. Set L based on observed lead times (calculate=4) to reflect confirmed actual lead time. Use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend forecasts over (1+L) periods using the elevated recent demand mean and volatility, improving service during this sustained uptick while capping orders via the OR cap to limit excess holding cost.

Period 12 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:

Date 2019-05-13 (Period 12). Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 (multiple arrivals with lead_time=4), so use calculated lead time. Demand has stepped up starting Periods 5\u201311 (several large demands 268\u2013477); to capture the recent higher regime use recent_N=5 for demand mean and volatility. On-hand=48 with in-transit=1579 provides large pipeline cover; parameters aim to size base-stock to recent elevated demand while letting backend cap limit orders.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/20 (Period 13). On-hand=37, in-transit=1564. Multiple concluded messages confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (consistent across Periods 5\u20138 arrivals). Demand regime shifted up starting Period 5 (larger demands in Periods 5\u201312); I treat this as the current regime. To reflect confirmed L=4 I let backend compute from observed lead-times (calculate). For demand I use recent_N over the post-changepoint regime (Periods 5\u201312, length 8) so mu_hat uses the mean of the last 8 demand samples to capture the sustained uptick. Volatility likely changed with the uptick, so sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=8) as well. These choices give the OR engine an L estimate grounded in concluded arrivals and demand stats that reflect the higher recent demand while keeping pipeline coverage aligned to the 4-period reality.

Period 14 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27 (Period 14). Recent history shows consistent actual lead time = 4 (multiple concluded messages: Periods 5\u201313 show arrivals from orders placed 4 periods earlier). Demand has shifted upward beginning around Period 5 (sustained higher demands through Periods 5\u201313). On-hand=82, in-transit=1497 \u2014 pipeline is large but many arrivals are already concluding with lead_time=4 so using observed lead time. I set L by averaging observed lead times to capture confirmed 4-period transit. For demand I use a recent_N regime to capture the sustained post-Period-4 uptick: regime length \u2248 9 periods (Periods 5\u201313), so N=9. Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat focuses the backend forecast on the higher recent mean and volatility, which raises the base-stock to avoid stockouts while the large pipeline limits excessive additional ordering and balances holding cost.

Period 15 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-06-03). Demand has shown a sustained uptick since Periods 5\u20136 (higher recent weekly sales); confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods from concluded arrivals. On-hand=0, in-transit=1461 \u2014 pipeline is large and covers multiple future periods but arrivals are observed with 4-period lag. Set L by averaging observed lead times to reflect confirmed 4-period regime. Use recent_N for mu_hat (N=5) to anchor the (1+L) demand forecast to the most recent demand regime rather than the old small-sample prior. Keep sigma_hat as default to let backend scale volatility with (1+L) and all samples. These choices balance service (capture higher recent demand) while avoiding overstating variability given ample pipeline.

Period 16 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/10 (Period 16). On-hand=30, in-transit=1751. Historical conclude messages show consistent actual lead time = 4 (confirmed arrivals for orders placed in Periods 1\u201311 all with lead_time=4). Demand has shifted up since Periods 5\u20136 and sustained through recent periods (demands in Periods 11\u201315 = 332,417,370,525,330). To cover review+lead demand and respect observed lead-time regime, set L by averaging observed lead times (captures confirmed L=4). For demand forecast use recent_N over the last 5 demand observations to reflect the sustained uptick (keeps mu_hat sensitive to new higher mean). Use recent_N for sigma to capture current volatility. These parameters increase target base-stock to reduce stockouts during sustained higher demand while the large in-transit position is already high; the OR backend cap will limit overstating orders.

Recent demand regime increased starting Period 5; recent demands (Periods 11\u201316 = 332,417,370,525,330,302) average ~379. To match observed actual LT and the sustained higher demand, set L to promised/default (=4) and set demand estimates using a recent_N window capturing the current high-demand regime (N=6). Using recent_N for sigma captures recent volatility. These parameters prioritize service (meet high recent demand) while letting the OR backend cap orders; large in-transit stock reduces immediate ordering urgency but recent_N keeps forecasts aligned with the uptick.

Period 19 (2019-07-01). On-hand=0, in-transit=1661. Historical concluded messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple confirms in Periods 5\u201318). Recent demand regime elevated since Periods 5\u20136 with higher weekly demand and several large spikes (e.g., 771 in P18, 525 in P14, 517 in P17). To capture the sustained uptick while remaining responsive to recent variability, set L by averaging observed lead times (calculate). Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat to weight the last 8 demand observations (N=8 chosen because the elevated-demand regime spans many periods; N=8 balances recency vs sample size). These parameters will raise the (1+L) demand forecast and reflect recent volatility so the OR backend increases base stock while keeping cap constraints in mind, helping avoid stockouts during the sustained high-demand regime and limiting excess holding.

Period 23 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/29 Period 23. On-hand=0, in-transit=1806. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead_time=4 (multiple confirms Periods 5\u201322). Demand regime shift: sustained higher demands beginning Period 5 (examples: Periods 5\u201322 show much larger demands vs early periods). Also several early delayed arrivals resolved into consistent 4-period lead times (monitor but no new lost shipments). Therefore: set L by calculating average of observed lead times to capture confirmed 4-period reality; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the most recent sustained high-demand regime (use N=18, the number of samples since the detected changepoint at Period 5) so the backend forecasts over review+lead horizon using current elevated demand mean and volatility. This raises target base stock to preserve service while in-transit stock is large; using recent_N helps the OR engine react to the sustained uptick and avoid stockouts while accounting for observed variance.

Period 24 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-08-05). On-hand=394, in-transit=1703. Historical concluded lead times all equal 4 periods (consistent arrivals in conclude messages), so set L to be inferred from observations. Demand history shows a sustained higher-demand regime vs the initial five-sample seed; however we have many periods of concluded data so use full-sample estimates for forecast stability. Using L='calculate' lets the backend use observed lead times (\u22484). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; given large pipeline this avoids overreacting to recent volatility while maintaining service level.

Period 25 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-08-12). On-hand=237, in-transit=1684. Historical conclues show consistent actual lead time=4 (confirmed repeatedly). Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 5 with elevated weekly demand; to react to this sustained uptick I use recent_N estimates over the most recent 10 demand samples to capture current mean and variance while keeping responsiveness reasonable. Using L=default (promised=4) aligns with verified actuals and avoids bias from earlier lost-order noise. recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat ensures the OR backend sizes base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of the current higher-demand regime, balancing service level against holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

Period 26 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019/8/19). On-hand=818, in-transit=1615. Historical concluded messages show stable actual lead time = 4 periods (consistent arrivals from Periods 5\u201325). Pipeline (1615) + on-hand (818) comfortably covers several periods of recent demand but demand has been volatile with a recent cooling from a prior upswing. To keep service while avoiding excess holding cost I set L by averaging observed lead times (reflects confirmed LT=4). For demand I use recent_N (last 5 periods) to capture the current regime (Periods 21\u201325 demand: 510,710,309,176,132) so the backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last5). For sigma_hat I also use recent_N N=5 so variability reflects the same window. This balances service (capture recent high variance) against holding cost given high on-hand inventory and large in-transit.

Period 27 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26 (Period 27). On-hand=1034, in-transit=1244. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (many concluded messages with lead_time=4). Demand has a sustained higher regime vs. seed samples; recent periods (P22\u2013P26) show variable but elevated demand. I set L by 'calculate' to reflect observed average lead time=4 from concluded history. For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current elevated regime (most relevant recent demands: P22\u2013P26). I also set sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) so volatility reflects the same recent window. These parameters prioritize service during the sustained uptick while keeping safety stock tuned to recent volatility; using observed lead time avoids under-ordering if promised lead time differs from reality.

Period 28 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019/9/2). Recent history shows consistent actual lead time = 4 (multiple concluded arrivals with lead_time=4) and a sustained higher-demand regime since Periods 5\u20136 that persists in subsequent periods. Current inventory: on-hand=1495, in-transit=644 \u2014 pipeline + on-hand is ample vs. recent weekly demands (typically hundreds), no outstanding unconcluded early-period orders. I set L via "calculate" to let the backend use the averaged observed lead times (captures confirmed L=4). I choose default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine uses all historical demand samples (scaled by 1+L), preserving stability while the backend's base-stock formula balances profit vs holding cost. This avoids overreacting to recent noise given already-high on-hand + in-transit positions.

Period 29 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019/9/9). Recent history shows consistent actual lead time = 4 (multiple concluded arrivals with W=4). On-hand=1417 + in-transit=644 = 2061 units in pipeline, which comfortably covers forecasted (1+L) demand under recent rates. Demand has been higher than the initial 5-sample prior but recent periods (Periods 24\u201328 demands = 176,132,155,139,78) suggest a moderate recent mean ~136. I set L by calculating observed lead times (reflecting confirmed W=4). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current demand regime and recent volatility; this keeps target base-stock responsive to the uptick while avoiding excess ordering given large existing pipeline.

Period 30 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/16 (Period 30). On-hand=1996, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead-times consistently 4 periods (many conclude messages show lead_time=4); earlier P1\u2013P2 delays resolved. Recent demand has moderated from summer peaks; last 5 concluded demands = [132,155,139,78,65] (Period 25\u201329) indicating lower current regime. I set L by calculation (use observed lead times average=4) to reflect confirmed actual lead time. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the recent downshift in demand (5-period sample gives a current mean ~113.8 and lower volatility), so the OR backend will size the (L+1)-period forecast and safety stock to current demand while avoiding excess holding given large on-hand. This also guards against treating old high summer demand as the new norm. If future concludes show lost shipments or lead-time changes, revise L explicitly.

Current inventory: on-hand=1966, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample coverage vs recent low weekly demand (last two periods demand 30,65). No recent lost shipments. Choose L via calculate to use observed lead-time evidence; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend uses full-sample demand mean/variance scaled by (1+L), preserving service given confirmed L and avoiding unnecessary replenishment while holding cost is nontrivial.

Actual lead time has been consistently 4 periods in concluded history. No outstanding arrivals past expected windows. To avoid overstocking given high on-hand and low recent demand, use the backend defaults (promised L=4 and default mu/sigma based on all samples) so the OR engine applies its standard base-stock cap and uses full-sample statistics.

Period 33 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-10-07). Swimwear in off-season; recent demand has dropped sharply from summer peaks to low weekly sales. On-hand=1869, in-transit=0 \u2014 no overdue arrivals. Recent demands (Periods 28\u201332) = [78,65,30,35,62], indicating a new low-demand regime starting ~Period 28. Lead time has consistently been 4 in concluded history. Set L=default to use promised lead time (4). For mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=5 to capture the new low-demand regime (last 5 periods) so base-stock and caps reflect current lower demand and avoid excess holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand decline since Period 28 (evidence: Periods 28\u201332 demands = 78,65,30,35,62); treat as new low-demand regime until contradicted.

Period 34 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-14 (Period 34). On-hand=1831, in-transit=0. Demand has fallen into a sustained low regime since Period 28 (demands 78,65,30,35,62,38 in Periods 28\u201333). Historical lead times have been consistently 4 periods (confirmed arrivals), no evidence of lost shipments recently. To avoid overstock while meeting (L+1) coverage, use promised lead time (default) and estimate demand/volatility from the recent low-demand regime using the last 6 periods (regime length=6). This reduces mu_hat and sigma_hat relative to historical highs, lowering ordering while preserving service for current low-demand environment.

Period 35 (2019-10-21). Recent history shows a sustained low-demand regime since Period 28 (demands: 78,65,30,35,62,38,43) and confirmed actual lead time = 4 in multiple concluded periods. On-hand = 1788, in-transit = 0 \u2014 no overdue or unconcluded shipments to cover demand. To align forecasting with the new low-demand regime while respecting the promised lead time, set L to default (promised = 4), use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base (1+L)-period demand estimates on the 7-period low-demand regime. This concentrates orders to avoid excessive holding cost while preserving service given abundant on-hand stock.

Period 36 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/10/28 (Period 36). On-hand = 1738, in-transit = 0, profit=2, holding=1. Recent history shows a clear demand downshift starting Period 28 (periods 28\u201335 demands = 78,65,30,35,62,38,43,50 \u2192 low, stable). Actual lead time repeatedly confirmed = 4 periods. To avoid excess holding cost given very high on-hand and the sustained low-demand regime, I shrink the forecast window to the recent low-demand regime. Set L=default to use promised lead time (4) which matches confirmed observations. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=8 (Periods 28\u201335) so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std, reducing replenishment to align with the new low-demand regime and lowering holding cost risk.

Period 37 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 37). On-hand = 1702, in-transit = 0. Historical concludes show consistent actual lead time = 4 periods (confirmed Periods 5\u201329 arrivals). Demand has shifted to a sustained low regime beginning Period 28 (demands P28\u2013P36 = 78,65,30,35,62,38,43,50,36). To avoid overstocking given large on-hand and low recent demand, keep L at promised (actual=4) and forecast using recent low-demand series. Chosen methods: L=default to reflect stable observed 4-period lead time; mu_hat=recent_N with N=9 to base (1+L)\xd7mean on the 9-period low-demand regime (Periods 28\u201336); sigma_hat=recent_N with N=9 to capture lower recent volatility. This reduces replenishment quantity and holding cost while maintaining service against near-term demand.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand decline beginning Period 28 (evidence: Periods 28\u201336 demands = 78,65,30,35,62,38,43,50,36); treat as new low-demand regime until contradicted.

Period 38 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-11-11). On-hand=1668, in-transit=0. Historical conclues confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (consistent arrivals P5\u2013P29). Demand regime has declined since Period 28 (recent demands ~78,65,30,35,62,38,43,50,36,34). To avoid excess holding cost given large on-hand, keep promised lead time and forecast using the recent low-demand regime: set L=default (promised 4), mu_hat based on the last 10 demand observations to capture the post-Period-28 low regime, and sigma_hat based on the last 10 to reflect recent volatility. This reduces future ordering and balances service vs holding cost given ample on-hand stock and no in-transit units.

Carry-over insight: Sustained low-demand regime beginning Period 28 (evidence: Periods 28\u201337 demands = 78,65,30,35,62,38,43,50,36,34); treat as new low-demand regime until contradicted.

Period 39 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-18). Recent history shows a sustained low-demand regime beginning Period 28 (demands Periods 28\u201338 = [78,65,30,35,62,38,43,50,36,34,42]); on-hand=1626, in-transit=0 \u2192 ample coverage vs. low demand; no overdue shipments. Actual lead time has repeatedly been 4 (confirmed historically). I set L to default (promised lead time=4). For demand I use recent_N over the low-demand regime to avoid overstating demand from earlier high season: mu_hat recent_N N=11 (covers Periods 28\u201338). Likewise use sigma_hat recent_N N=11 to capture current volatility. This reduces ordering to match the new low-demand regime and limits holding cost while keeping service.

Period 40 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019/11/25). Recent history shows a confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple concluded arrivals with lead_time=4). On-hand=1609, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample stock vs. current low-demand regime since Period 28. I set L by 'calculate' to capture observed lead-time behavior (avg observed = 4). Demand has shifted to a sustained low regime beginning Period 28 (12 periods of low weekly demand); to avoid excess holding cost I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=12 (the regime length) so the backend forecasts (1+L)*mean and volatility from the recent low-demand samples. This suppresses ordering while current inventory is large, reducing holding cost while preserving service in case demand persists.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019/12/2): on-hand=1496, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods \u2014 use promised lead time. Demand has been in a sustained low regime since Period 28 (demands \u2248 30\u201378), so forecast should use recent sample mean to avoid over-ordering given very large on-hand. Therefore set L=default (promised 4), mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=13 (captures Periods 28\u201340 low-demand regime) so the backend sizes base-stock to current low-demand expectations and avoids replenishment while on-hand is ample.

Period 42 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/9 (Period 42). Recent history shows a sustained low-demand regime starting Period 28 (demands since P28: 78,65,30,35,62,38,43,50,36,34,42,17,113,51 \u2014 recent mean well below earlier peaks). On-hand=1445, in-transit=0 so no pending arrivals; stock is ample vs current low demand. Actual lead time has been consistently 4 periods in concluded messages. I set L to default (promised lead time=4) because concluded arrivals confirm 4-period lead time. To avoid overstocking given clearly lower demand since Period 28, I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat using the recent low-demand regime length (14 periods: P28\u2013P41). This biases the OR backend forecast to current lower demand levels, reducing future orders and holding cost while preserving service. 

Carry-over insight: Sustained low-demand regime beginning Period 28 (evidence: Periods 28\u201341 demands = 78,65,30,35,62,38,43,50,36,34,42,17,113,51); treat as new low-demand regime until contradicted.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-1274.00

Period 43 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/16 (Period 43). On-hand=1388, in-transit=0 \u2192 no arrivals expected in upcoming arrival resolution. Historical concluded lead-times are consistently 4 periods (multiple concluded messages showing orders placed Periods 1\u201319 arriving with lead_time=4); use calculated L to reflect observed reality. Demand has been in a sustained low-demand regime beginning Period 28 (periods 28\u201342 demands = 78,65,30,35,62,38,43,50,36,34,42,17,113,51,57) \u2014 treat recent 15 periods as the current regime when forecasting mean and volatility. Therefore set L via calculate (uses observed lead times), set mu_hat using recent_N with N=15 to capture the low-demand regime mean over the review+lead window, and set sigma_hat using recent_N with N=15 to capture recent demand volatility. These choices align base-stock to recent lower demand while retaining the observed 4-period lead time, avoiding unnecessary stocking given high holding cost.

Historical concludes show a stable actual lead time of 4 periods (multiple concluded arrivals with lead_time=4) and a sustained low-demand regime since Period 28 (recent weekly demands mostly low: 78\u219265\u219230\u219235\u219262\u2192...). Given strong evidence that actual lead time matches the promised 4 and current inventory is ample, use conservative default estimates so the OR backend applies its standard base-stock calculation without overreacting to recent noise.

Product is seasonal swimwear and we are in year-end low season; recent history (Periods 28\u201344) shows sustained lower weekly demand (~30\u2013113, lower than earlier peaks). Inventory is high: on-hand=1273, in-transit=37; no overdue unconcluded shipments. Historical observed lead times consistently =4 when concluded, so use inferred average lead time. Use recent demand window to reflect the current low-demand regime and keep default volatility to avoid overreacting.
