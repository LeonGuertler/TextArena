Period 1 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25: swimwear season approaching (spring), recent demands show an upward shift (last sample 213). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must cover current-period demand. I set L to default (promised lead time = 0). I detect a recent demand regime uplift and use recent_N for demand estimates using the last 3 samples [152,129,213] (N=3) to capture the new higher average while limiting noise. mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last3) = 164.6666667 units. sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(last3) = 35.4430284 units. These parameters raise the base-stock to reflect higher recent demand and keep safety stock proportional to observed volatility, balancing service level for an upcoming season against holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Detected recent demand uplift: last 3 demands mean=164.67 vs overall mean=150.6; treat as new short-term regime until contradicted.

Period 2 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Period 1 concluded showing an on-time arrival (ordered and arrived in Period 1), so observed lead time=0. Recent demand uplift detected in Period 1 (last 3 demands mean=164.67 vs overall mean=150.6) \u2014 treat as current short-term regime. Set L by default to promised lead time = 0 (confirmed by the Period 1 conclude). For demand forecast use recent_N (N=3) to capture the uplift: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last 3) = 164.6667 units. For volatility use recent_N (N=3) population std: sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(last 3) = 35.4470. These choices increase the base-stock to cover the detected higher demand while keeping lead-time consistent with observed on-time arrivals, balancing service level vs. holding cost.

Period 3 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. Recent demand regime: Period1 carried insight shows uplift (last 3 demands mean=164.67). History shows two concluded arrivals with lead_time=0 (Period1 and Period2), so actual lead time = 0. On-hand=18, in-transit=0 \u2192 current stock well below short-term demand. I set L via observed lead times=0. I forecast demand using recent_N (N=3) to capture the detected uplift: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last 3 demands)=164.67 units. Volatility is recent_N std of last 3 samples: sigma_hat=43.42. These parameters raise the base-stock to cover the elevated short-term regime while keeping sigma based on recent variability; with profit $2 and holding $1 (q\u22480.667) this increases service level to avoid stockouts but limits excess holding by using recent-sample estimates.

Period 4 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/18. Product is seasonal swimwear; recent history shows strong, consistent same-period arrivals (observed lead_times=0 for Periods 1\u20133) and recent demand uplift. Carry-over insight (Period 1) flagged a short-term regime: last 3 demands mean=164.67 vs overall mean=150.6. I set L using the observed average lead time (0). For demand I use recent_N (N=3) to capture the detected uplift: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last 3) = 164.67 units. Volatility uses recent_N (N=3) std to reflect higher recent variability: sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(last 3) = 43.42 units. These choices keep the base-stock responsive to the recent higher demand while leveraging confirmed zero lead time to avoid over-ordering/in-transit coverage.

Daily Reward (R_t): $358.00

Period 5 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/25. Concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 for all past orders (Periods 1-4). Recent demand regime uplift persists: last 3 historical samples mean=164.67 vs overall mean=150.6. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish to the higher short-term demand. Set L to promised (0) given consistent observed lead times. Set mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to capture the uplift (mu_hat=(1+L)*mean_last3=164.67). Set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=3) to reflect increased volatility in the recent regime (std_last3\u224843.41). These parameters raise the base-stock to improve service for the sustained higher demand while keeping holding cost considered via q in the OR engine.

Daily Reward (R_t): $382.00

Period 6 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. All concluded periods (1-5) show orders arriving same period (observed lead_time=0 consistently), so use promised/default lead time L=0. Recent demand shows a clear uptick: last 3 concluded demands (Periods 3-5) = [181,200,268], mean=216.333. I treat this as the current short-term regime and set mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last 3). Volatility estimated from same window: sample std \u224845.75, scaled by sqrt(1+L) (L=0) -> sigma_hat=45.75. These parameters raise the base-stock to meet higher near-term demand while the zero lead time keeps pipeline small, balancing service vs holding cost given moderate holding penalty.

Carry-over insight: Recent demand regime uplift confirmed: Periods 3-5 mean=216.33 (vs prior overall lower mean); treat as sustained short-term higher demand until contradicted.

Period 7 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08. All concludes show orders arriving same period \u2192 observed lead_time=0. Recent demand has a clear uplift: Periods 4-6 demands = [200,268,376], mean=281.33 vs earlier series much lower. I set L to the observed average lead time (0). For demand I use recent_N (N=3) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime; mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last3)=281.333. For volatility I use recent_N (N=3) sample std of last3 -> sigma_hat=88.78. These parameters raise the base-stock to cover the new higher demand while keeping holding exposure limited given confirmed zero lead time.

Period 8 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/15. Recent periods show a sustained demand uplift (Periods 5-7: 268, 376, 295) vs earlier history. All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0, so promised LT=0 is supported. I set L=default (0). For demand I use recent_N (last 3) to capture the confirmed higher regime: (1+L)*mean(last3)=313.0. Volatility uses recent_N (last3) sample std -> 56.217 to reflect elevated variability. These parameters raise the base-stock to meet higher short-term demand while keeping holding cost exposure controlled by using a small N.

Daily Reward (R_t): $676.00

Period 9 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22. Concluded history shows all prior orders arrived with lead_time=0 (Periods 1-8), so use promised/default L=0. Carry-over insights confirm a sustained recent demand uplift; recent concluded demands (Periods 6-8) = [376, 295, 367] -> mean=346.0, elevated vs earlier mean. Use recent_N=3 to capture the new regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_recent = 346.0. sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std_recent; std([376,295,367])=44.394... -> sigma_hat=44.394 (rounded to 44.394). These parameters raise the base-stock to meet the confirmed higher demand while L=0 avoids inflating pipeline for non-existent delays.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand uplift confirmed: Periods 6-8 mean=346.0 (data: 376,295,367) vs prior overall mean ~150-165; treat as new short-term higher-demand regime until contradicted.

Period 10 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29. Historical concludes show actual lead time = 0 each period. Recent demand regime is elevated (Periods 6-9 demands = [376,295,367,477], mean=378.75) and clearly above earlier periods, so I use a recent-N estimate (N=4) to capture the current high-demand regime. Set L to promised default 0 (observed stable). mu_hat = (1+L)*mean of last 4 = 378.75 to target service for the elevated demand. sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*sample std of last 4 \u2248 74.88 to reflect current volatility. These parameters raise the base-stock to reduce stockouts during the sustained uplift while sigma captures variability to avoid excessive overstocking.

Period 11 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 11). Historical concluded lead times are all 0 periods \u2192 keep L as promised (0). Recent periods (6\u201310) show a sustained demand uplift (376,295,367,477,468); I use a recent_N forecast to capture the new regime. Set mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last 5 demands)=396.6 to raise base-stock to meet the higher short-term demand; set sigma_hat from the same 5-sample window (population std \u2248 68.14) so the OR engine sizes safety stock to cover observed volatility.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand uplift confirmed: Periods 6-10 mean=396.6 (data: 376,295,367,477,468) vs prior overall mean ~150-165; treat as new short-term higher-demand regime until contradicted.

Period 12 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13. Historical conclude messages show actual lead time = 0 each period. Demand has been in a higher regime recently (Periods 7-11: 295,367,477,468,332). On-hand=98, in-transit=0 so we must replenish for the elevated short-term demand. I set L based on recent observed lead times (all 0). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 (Periods 7-11) to capture the sustained uplift: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_recent = 387.8 units (covers the next review+lead period). sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std_recent \u2248 81.5 to reflect observed volatility. These parameters raise the base-stock to meet higher demand while keeping holding risk explicit to the OR engine.

Period 13 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/20. Recent strong, sustained uplift in demand since Period 6; last 5 demands (Periods 8-12 = 367,477,468,332,417) average 412.2 which is materially above prior regimes. On-hand=6, in-transit=0 \u2192 negligible pipeline, so order should cover expected single-period demand. I set L to promised/default (0) because all concluded orders show lead_time=0. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the current high-demand regime: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_recent5 to target service for the new regime; sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std_recent5 to reflect observed volatility. This raises target base-stock to avoid stockouts while keeping holding cost in mind (profit=2 vs holding=1 implies moderately aggressive service level).

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand uplift: Periods 8-12 mean=412.2 (367,477,468,332,417) vs prior lower regimes; treat as current short-term higher-demand regime until contradicted.

Period 14 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27 (Period 14). On-hand=70, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show every order arriving with lead_time=0 across Periods 1-13, so actual lead time = 0. Demand has moved to a sustained higher regime (recent 13-period mean \u2248315 units) \u2014 use full-history defaults to reflect that uplift while letting the OR engine compute safety stock from observed variance. Chosen L=0 (promised and observed), mu_hat = 1\xd7mean(all 13 demands) = 315.3077, sigma_hat = std(all 13 demands) = 109.2579. These parameters provide the backend with an elevated base-stock to meet current high demand while sigma captures increased volatility so service levels are balanced against holding cost.

Period 15 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03 (Period 15). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 in all past periods (orders arriving same period). Recent demand shows a sustained high-demand regime; last 5 demands (Periods 10-14 = 468,332,417,370,525) average 422.4. I set L to promised/default (0) since all concluded lead-times = 0. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the confirmed high-demand regime: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_recent = 422.4 to drive higher base-stock; sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std_recent \u2248 76.79 to reflect recent volatility. This increases service level to avoid stockouts while accounting for holding cost via the OR backend's q-derived z*.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed: Periods 10-14 mean=422.4 (468,332,417,370,525); replace prior regime with this updated short-term higher-demand estimate.

Period 16 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-06-10). On-hand=126, in-transit=0. Concluded history (Periods 1-15) shows consistent same-period arrivals (lead_time=0 each concluded period) and a sustained high-demand regime (recent demands much higher than the very early samples). Use promised lead time (L=0) because all concluded messages show lead_time=0. Set mu_hat to the empirical mean demand over all 15 concluded periods (1+L)*mean to reflect the sustained higher demand; set sigma_hat to the population-scaled std across the same 15 samples to capture current volatility. These parameters raise the base-stock to meet the higher service level implied by profit/holding (q=2/(2+1)=0.667) while the sigma estimate informs safety stock to limit stockouts without excessive holding given holding cost= $1/unit/period.

Carry-over insight: Sustained higher-demand regime confirmed across Periods 6-15; 15-period mean demand=330.27 and elevated volatility (std\u2248110.78).

Period 17 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 for past orders (Periods 1-16), so use promised lead time. Recent demand is elevated and consistent (16-period mean demand = 328.5), so set demand estimates to reflect the full-sample mean. Use default formulas (no changepoint override) so the OR backend sees L=0, mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_all = 328.5, sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std_all = 107.52. This balances higher service level given sustained high demand while avoiding extra hold cost by not inflating lead time or variance further.

Period 18 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/24 (Period 18). History shows consistent concluded lead_time=0 (all concluded arrivals note lead_time 0). Inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent demand has shifted to a higher regime \u2014 last 5 demands (Periods 13-17 = 370,525,330,302,517) have mean 408.8 and elevated volatility (sample std \u2248105.42). I set L to promised (default 0) because concluded history confirms 0. I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand regime and avoid diluting with older low-demand samples. This raises the base-stock to match current demand and reduces stockouts given zero pipeline. Parameters feed the OR backend a demand forecast focused on the last regime, balancing profit ($2) vs holding cost ($1) by reflecting current elevated mean and observed volatility.

Carry-over insight: New sustained high-demand regime confirmed in most recent periods: Periods 13-17 mean=408.8 (370,525,330,302,517); elevated volatility (std\u2248105.42).

Period 19 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/1 (Period 19). Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime in the most recent periods (Periods 14-18 demands = 525, 330, 302, 517, 771). Promised lead time is 0 and all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0, so use L=0. To be responsive to the clear elevated demand, set mu_hat using recent_N=5 (captures the most recent regime) and set sigma_hat from the same 5-sample window to reflect elevated volatility. These params push the OR backend baseline up to cover the higher short-term demand while sigma_hat raises safety stock for service; keeping L=0 avoids inflating pipeline for no observed lead-time shift.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed: Periods 14-18 mean=489.0 (525,330,302,517,771); elevated volatility std\u2248188.37. Treat as current short-term higher-demand regime until contradicted.

Period 20 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019/7/8. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime in most recent periods (Periods 15-19 demands = 330,302,517,771,592). I set lead time L to promised (0) because all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0. For demand I use recent_N=5 to capture the latest regime (N=5 covers Periods 15-19) so mu_hat = mean_recent = 502.4 units (review+lead = 1+L times mean). For sigma_hat I use recent_N=5 population std scaled by sqrt(1+L) => sigma_hat = 173.36. These choices bias orders toward higher service (higher base stock) to avoid stockouts given the clear recent uplift, while acknowledging holding cost by using only the most recent regime rather than the long-run mean.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime in recent periods: Periods 15-19 mean=502.4, std\u2248173.36; treat as current short-term higher-demand regime until contradicted.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/15. On-hand=44, in-transit=0. All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 consistently; no lost shipments. Demand has moved to a sustained high regime \u2014 recent 5-period demands (Periods 16-20) = [302,517,771,592,542], mean=544.8, elevated volatility (std\u2248149.73). Set L to promised/default 0 (supported by concluded history). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the current high-demand regime so the OR backend increases base-stock to meet higher expected demand while reflecting elevated uncertainty.

Period 22 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-22 (Period 22). On-hand=108, in-transit=0; recent history shows consistent same-period arrivals (observed lead_time=0 each concluded period) and a sustained elevated demand regime. I set L to default (promised) = 0 because concluded history repeatedly confirms 0-period lead time. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the default (all-sample) formulas to reflect the full observed elevated demand pattern: mean demand across Periods 1\u201321 = 390.857 units \u2192 mu_hat=(1+L)*mean; sample std \u2248151.99 \u2192 sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std. These parameters give the OR engine a demand-centric base-stock that balances the high recent demand (to avoid stockouts) against holding cost given current on-hand is small relative to forecasted demand.

Period 23 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29 (Period 23). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show promised lead time=0 every period (orders always arrived same period) so no sign of lost shipments. Recent periods (16\u201322) exhibit a clear sustained demand uplift (demands: 302,517,771,592,542,510,710) \u2014 I treat this as the current regime. To prioritize service during this high season while capping holding cost, I set L to the promised lead time (0) and use a recent_N demand estimate (N=7, last 7 periods) so mu_hat reflects the elevated recent mean; sigma_hat uses the same recent window to capture elevated volatility. These parameters push the OR engine's base-stock up to meet current high demand while using a recent volatility estimate to avoid excessive overstock.

Carry-over insight: New sustained very-high demand regime: Periods 16-22 mean=563.43 (demands: 302,517,771,592,542,510,710), std\u2248150.61; treat as current short-term regime until contradicted.

Period 24 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 24). Recent periods show a sustained high-demand regime. Last 7 demands (Periods 17-23): [517,771,592,542,510,710,309], mean=564.4286 and elevated volatility (std\u2248148.71). All historical conclude messages show lead_time=0 consistently. I set L to promised default=0. I use recent_N=7 for mu_hat to capture the current very-high short-term regime (1+L)\xd7mean_last7 = 564.4286. I set sigma_hat via recent_N=7 (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std_last7 = 148.71) so the OR backend raises the base-stock to service the elevated demand while accounting for higher variability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-102.00

Period 25 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/12. On-hand=454, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead-times are consistently 0 periods \u2192 use promised/default L=0. Recent demand shows a regime shift vs early history: last 5 demands (Periods 20-24) = [542,510,710,309,176], mean=449.4, elevated volatility std\u2248186.9. I choose recent_N=5 to capture the most recent regime (N=5 captures the latest trend without overreacting). This yields mu_hat=(1+L)*mean_recent=449.4 and sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std_recent\u2248186.9. With on-hand ~454 (\u2248one period of recent mean) and no pipeline, these parameters steer the OR backend to target roughly one period of the current high-demand regime while reflecting high uncertainty to avoid stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Recent demand regime updated: last 5 periods mean=449.4, std\u2248186.9 (Periods 20-24 = 542,510,710,309,176); replace prior carry-over regime estimate.

Period 26 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/19. Historical concludes show promised lead time = 0 consistently (all past orders arrived with lead_time 0). On-hand=408, in-transit=0. Recent demand has softened in the last two periods (176,132) versus earlier very high periods, so I use a short recent-window forecast to capture current regime. Set L to default (promised=0). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 (last 5 demands: 510,710,309,176,132) so the OR engine targets service for the near-term elevated but volatile regime while reflecting the recent drop in demand.

Carry-over insight: New recent-demand update: last 5 demands (Periods 21-25) mean=367.4, std\u2248241.4 \u2014 lower than prior carry-over estimate (mean~449.4); treat as current short-term regime until contradicted.

Period 27 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26 (Period 27). On-hand=317, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times all 0 \u2192 use promised/default L=0. Recent demand has dropped from prior peaks; last 5 demands (Periods 22-26 = 710,309,176,132,155) show a lower short-term mean and high dispersion. Use recent_N (N=5) to reflect the latest regime. With L=0, set mu_hat = 1\xd7recent_mean (296.4) and sigma_hat = 1\xd7recent_std (\u2248241.3) so the OR engine targets service for the current short-term demand while acknowledging elevated volatility; this avoids over-ordering relative to the immediate post-decline demand signal.

Carry-over insight: Recent demand regime updated: last 5 periods (P22-26) mean=296.4, std\u2248241.3 \u2014 lower than prior very-high regime; treat as current short-term regime until contradicted.

Period 29 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-09. Recent realized arrivals show promised lead time has consistently been 0 (all concluded orders had lead_time=0). Recent demand has dropped sharply in the last five periods (Periods 24-28 demands = 176,132,155,139,78; mean=136, std\u224832.7) compared with the long-run mean (~353). On-hand is 184 with zero in-transit, so current cover is ~1.35x one-period recent demand. I set L to default (promised) = 0 because concluded history shows lead_time=0. To avoid overstocking after the clear recent downshift, I use a recent_N forecast for mu_hat (N=5) to capture the new short-term lower-demand regime; mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last 5) = 136.0. For sigma_hat I use recent_N (N=5) to reflect lower recent volatility: sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(last 5) \u2248 32.7. These parameters reduce target base stock relative to the long-run elevated levels and limit holding cost while preserving service for the observed lower recent demand.

Carry-over insight: Recent demand drop: Periods 24-28 mean=136.0, std\u224832.7 (demands: 176,132,155,139,78). Treat as current short-term lower-demand regime until contradicted.

Period 30 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/16 (Period 30). Recent realized demand has dropped sharply \u2014 last 5 demands (Periods 24-28) = [176,132,155,139,78], mean=136.0, std\u224832.7, well below earlier high-demand regimes. All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 historically. To avoid excess holding cost I adopt the recent low-demand regime for forecasting: use promised L=0, m\xfb based on recent_N=5, and sigm\xe2 based on recent_N=5.

Period 32 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-30. On-hand=81, in-transit=0. Recent demand shows a clear drop vs earlier high-season: last 5 periods (P27-P31) demands = [139,78,65,30,35], mean=69.4, std\u224843.8. No evidence of delayed/lost shipments (lead times historically 0). To avoid excessive holding cost while maintaining service for the new lower-demand regime, set lead time to promised (0) and forecast using the most recent 5-period regime for mu and sigma so the OR base-stock reflects the lower demand and reduced volatility.

Period 33 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-07 (Period 33). On-hand=27, in-transit=0. Recent demand has fallen sharply: last 5 demands (Periods 28-32) = [78,65,30,35,62], mean=54.0, std\u224820.61. No outstanding arrivals; promised lead time=0 has been reliable historically (all concluded lead_times=0). I set L=default (promised=0) to reflect observed on-time same-period arrivals. For demand I use a recent_N forecast (N=5) to capture the clear short-term downshift; mu_hat = (1+L)*recent_mean = 54.0. Volatility set to recent_N std scaled by sqrt(1+L) => sigma_hat\u224820.61. This keeps base-stock low to avoid holding cost while matching the current low-demand regime and preserving service given low lead time.

Carry-over insight: New short-term lower-demand regime: Periods 28-32 mean=54.0, std\u224820.6 (demands: 78,65,30,35,62). Treat as current regime until contradicted.

Period 34 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-14 (Period 34). Recent demand has dropped sharply: last 5 demands (Periods 29-33) = [65,30,35,62,38], mean \u224846 units, low volatility. On-hand=25, in-transit=0 so on-hand covers ~0.54 of one-period demand \u2014 low but not critical. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=0. I therefore set L to the promised/default (0). I set mu_hat using recent_N (last 5) to capture the new short-term low-demand regime: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_last5 \u224846. I set sigma_hat using recent_N (last 5) sample volatility \u224816.27 to reflect reduced uncertainty. These parameters bias the OR backend toward much lower replenishment (reducing holding cost) while preserving service for the new low-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: New short-term lower-demand regime detected: Periods 29-33 mean=46.0, sample std\u224816.27 (demands: 65,30,35,62,38). Treat as current regime until contradicted.

Period 36 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28, product is seasonal swimwear heading into late Oct (off-peak). Recent sales have dropped into a clear low-demand regime (Periods 31-35). All past conclude messages show arrivals with lead_time=0 (no evidence of lost/late shipments). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so orders placed now will arrive same period. I choose L=default (promised 0). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the confirmed short-term low-demand regime (Periods 31-35 mean \u224845.6). sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=5) sample std \u224810.78. These parameters reduce inventory/holding cost while matching current low demand to balance service vs holding.

Period 38 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/11 (Period 38). Recent demand has fallen to a clear low-demand regime: last 5 periods (P33-37) show demands [38,43,50,36,34], mean ~40.2 and low volatility. All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 historically, so keep promised L=0. To avoid overstocking, set demand forecast using the recent 5-period regime (N=5). This keeps base_stock aligned with the new low-demand regime and reduces holding cost risk while preserving service for the current low demand pattern.

On-hand=1, in-transit=0 \u2014 risk of stockout this period but demand is low. I set L=default (promised 0) and use a recent_N forecast (N=5) to capture the confirmed low-demand regime so the OR backend targets a low base-stock, reducing holding cost while maintaining service.

Period 40 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date=2019-11-25 (Period 40). On-hand=27, in-transit=0. Recent history shows a sustained low-demand regime since Period 29; last 5 demands (Periods 35-39) = [50,36,34,42,17], mean=35.8, sample std\u224812.21. Promised lead time=0 and all recent concludes show lead_time=0, so use L=0. Use a recent_N demand estimate (N=5) to reflect the new low-demand regime and lower volatility, avoiding excess holding cost given profit=$2 vs holding=$1.

Period 41 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 41). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent history shows a short-term lower-demand regime after the post-summer collapse and recent small weekly sales with a single Black Friday spike (Period 40=113). I therefore treat the most recent 5 periods (P36-40) as the best short-term forecast anchor. Set L to promised (0) since all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 and no lost shipments. mu_hat: use recent_N (N=5) => (36+34+42+17+113)/5 = 48.4 units to cover current-period demand. sigma_hat: recent_N (N=5) sample std \u2248 37.3 to represent elevated dispersion from the BF spike. These choices keep the base-stock low to avoid holding cost while covering expected near-term demand and short variability from the recent spike.

Carry-over insight: New short-term lower-demand regime: Periods 36-40 mean=48.4, std\u224837.3 (demands: 36,34,42,17,113). Treat as current regime until contradicted.

Period 42 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09. Recent demand has reverted to a low short-term regime (recent 5 periods much lower than earlier season). On-hand=14, in-transit=0 so we must cover current period demand immediately. I set L to the promised lead time (0) since all concluded messages show lead_time=0 and no missing shipments. For demand I use a recent_N estimate (N=5, Periods 37-41) to capture the current low-demand regime: mean \u224851.4 units for the review+lead window. Volatility is based on the same recent 5-sample regime (sample std \u224836.63). These parameters keep the base-stock responsive to the current low-demand environment, minimizing holding cost while preserving service for the short-term regime.

=== Period 42 Summary ===
599580017: ordered=54, arrived=54 units (ordered on Period 42, lead_time was 0 periods), starting on-hand inventory=68, demand=57, sold=57, ending on-hand inventory=11

Period 43 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/16. Recent history shows a clear shift to a low-demand regime: last 5 demands (Periods 38-42) = [42,17,113,51,57], mean \u224856, elevated but moderate dispersion. All concluded lead-times = 0 \u2192 actual lead time remains 0. On-hand=11, in-transit=0 so available coverage is very low vs recent mean; choose parameters that target the new low-demand regime to avoid excess holding. I set L using recent observed lead-times (default/0). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the current low-demand regime (reduces overstock risk vs using long-run mean). These parameters give the OR backend a low base-stock target consistent with recent demand and the profit/holding tradeoff.

Carry-over insight: New short-term low-demand regime (Periods 38-42) mean=56.0, std\u224835.33; treat as current regime until contradicted.

Period 44 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/23. Recent demand has settled to a low short-term regime: last 3 sales (Periods 41-43) = [51,57,58], mean\u224855.33, low variance. On-hand=14, in-transit=0 so current pipeline=14; expected one-period demand (L+1) \u224855.3 > pipeline so we should replenish. Promised lead time=0 has been observed consistently (concluded arrivals show 0), so use L=default (promised). Set mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to capture the current low-demand regime and avoid overstocking from older high-season spikes. Set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=3) to reflect low recent volatility. These parameters bias the OR engine to target a base-stock near current short-term demand, balancing service (avoid stockouts) against holding cost.

Carry-over insight: New short-term low-demand regime detected: Periods 41-43 mean\u224855.33 (51,57,58), low volatility; treat as current regime until contradicted.

Period 45 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30. Recent history shows a short-term low-demand regime vs earlier summer peaks; last 5 demands (Periods 40-44 = 113,51,57,58,57) average 67.2 with low-moderate volatility. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Promised lead time=0 and recent concluded arrivals always 0-lead, so use L=default (0). To align the OR backend with the current low-demand regime while avoiding excess holding cost, set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect current mean demand; set sigma_hat from the same recent sample to capture local volatility. These parameters lean toward lower base-stock and tighter cap, reducing overstock risk during the post-Christmas low-demand period while keeping enough stock to satisfy typical recent demand and preserve profit.

Carry-over insight: New short-term lower-demand regime: Periods 40-44 mean=67.2, std\u224825.8 (demands: 113,51,57,58,57). Treat as current regime until contradicted.
