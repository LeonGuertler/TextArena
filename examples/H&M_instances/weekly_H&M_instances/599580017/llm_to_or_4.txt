Period 1 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. SKU is swimwear (seasonal; demand may rise approaching spring), but historical samples [61,98,152,129,213] show no clear recent changepoint and there are no concluded arrival messages to infer lead-time or lost shipments. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Use promised lead time (default) because no observed lead-time data exists. Use default demand estimates so the OR engine applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std based on all samples; this balances service level vs holding cost conservatively while avoiding overreacting to seasonal intuition without on-record evidence.

Period 2 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/4 (Period 2). On-hand=0, in-transit=225 (order placed in Period 1 not yet concluded/arrived). No concluded arrivals exist to infer actual lead time; therefore use promised lead time. Historical demand samples = [61,98,152,129,213]; no clear recent changepoint. To balance service vs holding cost, use default demand statistics across (1+L) review+lead period so the OR engine computes base-stock with full-sample mean/variance while respecting the promised L and the pipeline of 225 units.

Period 3 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Two consecutive conclude messages (Periods 1\u20132) show ordered units but arrived=0 \u2192 evidence of delayed or lost shipments beyond promised LT=4. To be conservative and cover the extended pipeline risk, I set L explicitly to 8 periods. Demand history (samples [61,98,152,129,213], mean=130.6) will be used in full so mu_hat and sigma_hat use the default rules ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to scale forecast variance and service target appropriately. This increases on-order coverage to balance service level against holding cost given missing arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Observed possible shipment loss/delay: Periods 1\u20132 ordered but arrived=0 (orders not concluding on schedule); treat as extended lead-time regime until an arrival conclude is observed.

Period 4 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 4). Demand history shows samples [61,98,152,129,213] (mean=130.6). Orders placed in Periods 1\u20133 have not concluded (arrived=0), indicating an extended lead-time or lost shipments. To be conservative I set lead time explicitly longer than promised to force the OR engine to cover more pipeline: L explicit = 6. For demand forecasting I use default aggregation so backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This increases the base-stock target to protect service levels while the missing arrivals are resolved.

Period 5 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 5). On-hand=0, in-transit=911. Historical demands = [61,98,152,129,213] (mean ~130.6). Orders from Periods 1\u20134 have not concluded (arrived=0), creating uncertainty but no concluded arrivals yet to compute an empirical lead time. Promised lead time remains the only reliable L. Use default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean) and default volatility to let the OR backend apply its base-stock calculation while respecting the promised lead time and caps. This avoids overfitting to unconfirmed delays and keeps pipeline coverage for (L+1) periods.

Carry-over insight: Observed extended delivery disruption: orders placed in Periods 1\u20134 have not concluded (arrived=0); treat as potential extended lead-time regime until an arrival conclude is observed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $450.00

Period 6 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-04-01). Recent concluded arrival: Period 5 showed arrived=225 (ordered Period 1, lead_time=4), confirming actual lead time = 4 for that observed shipment. On-hand=0, in-transit=686 which equals orders from Periods 2\u20134 (228+228+230). Given confirmed lead time and no fresh evidence of extended loss, use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR engine uses full-sample mean/variance. This balances service (use promised/now-confirmed L=4) against holding cost while awaiting the in-transit arrivals that will conclude in upcoming periods.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (evidence: Period 5 conclude: arrived=225 units ordered on Period 1, lead_time was 4). Previous suspected extended-loss regime is not currently asserted.

Period 7 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-04-08). Recent concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 (Period 5 conclude: order from P1 arrived with LT=4; Period 6 conclude: P2 arrived with LT=4). On-hand=0, in-transit=654 (outstanding arrivals visible in pipeline). Demand has trended up in recent periods (P4\u2013P6: 200, 268, 376) but no persistent regime change beyond the confirmed LT. Use promised/confirmed lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend applies its historical-sample based base-stock policy while respecting the 1+L review horizon and current pipeline volume.

Daily Reward (R_t): $456.00

Period 8 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-15). Recent demand has risen sharply (Period4-7: 200,268,376,295) vs earlier low samples; on-hand=0, in-transit=750 (matches outstanding orders: P4=230,P6=196,P7=324). Concluded arrivals show consistent actual lead time = 4 periods (Period5-7 conclude: orders from P1-P3 had lead_time=4). I therefore use promised/default lead time. To capture the recent higher-demand regime I set mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 (focus on the last 5 demand observations to reflect the uplift). For volatility, use recent_N N=5 to reflect recent demand variability. These parameters balance service (cover L+1 periods of elevated demand) against holding cost by anchoring forecasts on the most recent demand regime while keeping lead time at the confirmed 4 periods.

Period 9 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22 (Period 9). Recent conclude messages (Periods 5-8) consistently show orders placed in Periods 1-4 arriving with lead_time=4; treat lead time as 4. On-hand=0, in-transit=913 (pipeline covers upcoming demand but arrivals are delayed by confirmed 4-period lead time). Demand has increased sharply vs. earlier snapshot; use a recent-window demand forecast to capture elevated mean/volatility (last 5 realized demands: Periods 4-8 = 200,268,376,295,367). Choose L by averaging observed lead times (calculate) to reflect confirmed 4-period actual lead time. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to make (1+L)-period demand forecast match the recent high-demand regime and to let OR backend size base-stock for higher service with awareness of elevated variance.

Period 10 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/29 (Period 10). Recent history shows confirmed actual lead time = 4 (arrivals from Orders on Periods 1\u20134 concluded with lead_time=4). Demand has stepped up materially in recent periods (Period5\u20139 demands: 268, 376, 295, 367, 477) vs earlier seed samples. On-hand=0, in-transit=1335 (large pipeline). I set L to 'calculate' to use observed lead times (captures confirmed LT=4). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to reflect the new high-demand regime (use last 5 demands). I also set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=5) to capture volatility in the recent regime. These choices focus the base-stock on the elevated recent mean while using observed lead time, and avoid diluting forecasts with much older low-demand samples given the clear upward shift. Pipeline is currently large enough that the OR cap will limit new orders, reducing overstock risk.

Period 11 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-05-06). Swimwear category with approaching peak season; recent concluded history consistently shows lead_time=4 (Period 5: order P1 arrived, lead_time=4; Periods 6\u201310 concl: P2\u2013P6 arrivals also show 4). On-hand=0, in-transit=1630 \u2014 pipeline is large and consistent with a 4-period lead time. No persistent lost-order signal after confirmations. Use default (promised) lead time and default demand/volatility estimators so OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over all samples; this balances service (higher demand & seasonal risk) against holding cost given large pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (evidence: Period 5 conclude: arrived=225 units ordered on Period 1, lead_time=4; subsequent concludes P6\u2013P10 consistent with 4).

Period 12 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-05-13): demand history shows intermittent large demands with confirmed consistent 4-period actual lead time (Period 5\u201311 concludes show arrivals from orders placed 4 periods earlier). Current on-hand=0, in-transit=1306 which matches pipeline from recent orders arriving under 4-period lead time. I set L via 'calculate' to reflect observed lead-time regime (average of observed concludes = 4). I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, keeping forecasts anchored to full-sample demand statistics; this balances service-level (covers L+1 periods) against holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

Period 13 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20 (Period 13). Recent concluded history consistently shows actual lead time = 4 (multiple concludes P5\u2013P12), and demand has risen materially in recent periods (periods 8\u201312 demands: 367, 477, 468, 332, 417). To capture the current high-demand regime and avoid understocking during seasonal swimwear demand, use L=default (promised 4). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to base the (1+L) demand forecast and volatility on the most recent 5 demand observations, reflecting the current elevated mean and variance. This balances service level (higher reorder target) against holding cost by tuning to recent demand rather than older low-demand samples. No explicit adjustment for lost shipments is needed because concludes confirm on-time 4-period arrivals.

Pipeline is large relative to on-hand, so no emergency adjustment needed. Use default lead time (promised 4) and default demand statistics ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) so the OR backend computes base_stock from full-sample moments; this keeps policy stable given confirmed LT=4 and substantial in-transit inventory, balancing service vs holding cost.

Period 15 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-06-03). On-hand=18, in-transit=901. Concluded history shows consistent arrivals with lead_time=4 (Periods 5\u201314 concludes all indicate 4); pipeline is large relative to on-hand. I set L to 'calculate' to lock in observed average lead time (captures confirmed 4-period regime). Demand has shifted up recently versus the small-sample prior; use recent_N for mu_hat to reflect the higher recent mean (N=5 covers the most recent demand samples). Volatility estimate uses default to let backend scale \u03c3\u0302 with all samples and the chosen L. These choices increase target base-stock to avoid stockouts given confirmed LT=4 while keeping \u03c3\u0302 conservative to limit excessive holding given sizable pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (evidence: Period 5 conclude arrived=225 units ordered on Period 1, lead_time=4; subsequent concludes P6\u2013P14 consistent with 4).

LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-06-10). On-hand=0, in-transit=1551. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple confirms P5\u2013P15). Several recent arrivals and demands exhausted inventory each period; pipeline (1551) is large relative to single-period demand but arrivals occur with L=4. To let the OR engine use promised lead time and full-sample demand statistics while respecting observed stable lead time, I select default methods for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This keeps forecasts conservative and leverages all demand history while the pipeline clears and avoids overreacting to transient spikes.

Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. Given large pipeline and stable observed lead-time regime, use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility from all samples; this lets the engine size base-stock and cap while accounting for the confirmed L=4 and current pipeline.

Period 19 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:

Current inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=1209 (pipeline coverage). Given confirmed stable L=4, use default lead time to let backend use promised L. Demand sample set is the provided historical samples; no strong recent changepoint in demand mean/variance that requires ad-hoc weighting. Using default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) lets the OR engine compute a base-stock that balances profit vs holding cost while respecting the capped order size and observed stable lead time. This conservatively addresses earlier delayed arrivals (now resolved) by relying on concluded lead-time evidence rather than treating shipments as lost.

Period 20 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-07-08). Recent demand has risen and become volatile (last 5 period demands: P15\u2013P19 = 330,302,517,771,592) reflecting peak swimwear season. On-hand=58, in-transit=1077 (sufficient pipeline). Actual lead time has been repeatedly observed as 4 periods; use promised/default L to keep OR engine aligned. To react to the elevated recent demand while limiting stale historical smoothing, set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent regime (last 5 periods) so the base-stock and caps reflect current high mean and higher variability. This balances service (avoid stockouts in peak season) versus holding cost by only switching demand estimates, not forcing an explicit longer L.

Concluded history shows consistent actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple conclude messages: e.g., Period 5 conclude: arrived=225 ordered Period 1, lead_time=4 and subsequent concludes P6\u2013P21 consistent). Given confirmed LT=4, set L to be computed from observed lead times (calculate) so backend uses empirical average. Demand forecasting: use default (all-sample mean scaled by 1+L) for mu_hat and default for sigma_hat to let OR engine compute base-stock from full-sample statistics; this keeps policy stable and responsive while the pipeline is large (1860) and avoids overfitting to recent volatile demands. This configuration aligns promised lead time with observed deliveries and lets the backend cap orders per its cap rule, balancing service level (profit>$ holding cost) against holding cost while we hold a large in-transit position.

Demand history shows high, variable weekly demand with samples [61,98,152,129,213] and the game history of concludes consistently indicates actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple concludes P5\u2013P23 consistent). Current inventory: on-hand=209, in-transit=1431 (large pipeline arriving per 4-period lead time). Given confirmed stable lead-time regime and substantial pipeline, use default methods so the OR backend computes base-stock using full-sample mean/variance over (1+L) periods. This balances service (high demand peaks) vs holding cost by relying on backend's analytic cap and historical stats rather than overfitting recent noise or reducing L. No explicit correction for lost shipments is needed because concludes show regular 4-period arrivals.

Period 25 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-08-12). Recent concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods; supply disruptions observed earlier have resolved. Current inventory: on-hand=855, in-transit=906 \u2014 pipeline + on-hand is ample vs. recent weekly demand variability. I choose L=default to use promised lead time (4) which matches observed concludes. Use mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history; this leverages all demand history while the confirmed lead-time regime is stable and lets the capped ordering cap limit excessive orders given holding cost >0.

Period 26 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19 Period 26. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple concludes P5\u2013P25 with lead_time=4), so use promised/default lead time. Recent demand shows a summer/high-volume regime (recent demands: P21\u2013P25 = 510,710,309,176,132) \u2014 I use a recent_N demand estimate to capture this upward-shift vs. the long-run seed. On-hand (723) + in-transit (1052) = 1775 units currently in pipeline; parameters use recent demand stats to avoid overstock while covering (L+1) periods of elevated demand and to limit holding cost given holding=$1/unit/period and profit=$2/unit.

Given stable LT=4 and no new changepoint in demand, use defaults so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples.

Period 30 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-16). Product is swimwear heading into late summer; recent demand historically high but now moderating (see recent concludes with lower weekly demands: 78,65). On-hand=1338, in-transit=374 \u2014 ample coverage for multiple weeks. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (confirmed across Periods 5\u201329). No new evidence of lost shipments. I choose default methods so the OR backend uses promised L=4 and full-sample demand statistics ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to compute base-stock and cap. This leverages long-run demand estimates while avoiding extra safety stock given current high on-hand inventory, balancing service level against holding cost.

Historical concluded arrivals show a consistent actual lead time of 4 periods (multiple concludes P5\u2013P31 consistent with lead_time=4), and recent conclude (P31) shows no new arrival but no sustained loss pattern. Demand context: past sample mean=130.6 (samples [61,98,152,129,213]). Given stable confirmed L=4 and no strong recent demand regime change, use the promised/default lead time and default demand statistics so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility from full sample set. This balances service (use 5-period coverage) against holding cost given high on-hand inventory and moderate profit/holding ratio.

This balances service (maintain high on-hand) while avoiding unnecessary extra safety stock given current high on-hand and consistent LT=4.

Period 38 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-11-11). On-hand=1438, in-transit=50. Recent concludes (P33\u2013P37) consistently show arrivals with lead_time=4, so use promised/default lead time. Demand has fallen from summer peaks to ~30\u201350 units/week in the most recent periods; I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 demand samples to reflect the new lower-demand regime and reduce excess future ordering. This balances service (cover near-term demand) against holding cost given high on-hand inventory.

Carry-over insight: New sustained demand downshift since late summer/early fall: recent 5-period demands (P33\u2013P37) \u2248 [38,43,50,36,34], mean \u224840; retain confirmed actual lead time = 4 (consistent P33\u2013P37 concludes).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Recent demand has downshifted (Periods 33\u201337 demands = [38,43,50,36,34], mean \u2248 40), so use a 5-period recent demand estimate to capture the new lower regime and reduce target inventory. Choose L=default to keep promised lead time=4 (confirmed by concludes). mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=5 to align the (1+L) forecast and volatility to the recent low-demand regime, trading off service level vs holding cost.

Period 40 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-25). Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (concludes P5\u2013P39 all consistent with 4). Demand regime has downshift since late summer: recent 5-period demands (P33\u2013P37) \u2248 [38,43,50,36,34], mean \u224840. Current inventory (on-hand 1398 + in-transit 31) far exceeds short-run demand (covers many (1+L)=5 periods), so reduce forecast horizon to recent demand to avoid holding cost. Set L to promised/default (4) since concludes confirm it. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the new low-mean, low-volatility regime and tighten orders accordingly.

Period 41 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-12-02). On-hand=1308, in-transit=8 \u2192 ample coverage vs. recent demand. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods. Recent demand (Periods 33\u201337) shows sustained downshift: demands \u2248 [38,43,50,36,34], mean\u224840 vs. earlier higher-season peaks. To avoid excess holding cost while preserving service, keep L=promised (4) and base demand forecast on the recent low-demand regime (last 5 periods). Use recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using the most recent regime, reducing replenishment relative to full-sample averages.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand downshift detected in late summer/early fall \u2192 use recent 5-period mean (P33\u2013P37 mean\u224840) for forecasting; confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (consistent concludes P5 and P6\u2013P40).

Period 42 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019/12/9). Recent history shows a sustained late-summer/fall demand downshift (periods 33\u201337 mean \u224840) and confirmed actual lead time = 4. On-hand=1265, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample stock now so prioritize matching lowered demand to avoid holding cost. Set L to promised (default=4) consistent with confirmed regime. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor the (1+L) forecast and volatility to the recent low-demand regime (reduces excess ordering and holding). This keeps base-stock and cap computations conservative given large on-hand and lower recent demand.

Period 43 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-16). On-hand=1208, in-transit=0. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple Period concludes P5\u2013P42 with lead_time=4). Recent sustained demand downshift detected in late summer/early fall: periods 33\u201337 demands \u2248 [38,43,50,36,34], mean \u2248 40. Given high on-hand and zero pipeline, use the confirmed L=4 regime and a recent-5 forecast to avoid overordering while matching the lower demand level. Methods chosen: L default (promised = 4, consistent with concluded evidence); mu_hat recent_N N=5 to use the recent 5-period mean (captures downshift); sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to reflect recent lower volatility. This minimizes excess holding cost while preserving service under the confirmed 4-period lead time.

Period 45 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30 (Period 45). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history (multiple concludes P5 and P6\u2013P44). On-hand=1093, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample on-hand relative to the recent lower-demand regime. Historical demand shows a sustained downshift since late summer (reference P33\u2013P37 mean \u224840 units/period). To avoid excess holding cost while preserving service given confirmed L=4, I set L to the promised/default (4) and set mu_hat explicitly to a conservative forecast using the downshifted per-period mean \u224840: mu_hat = (1+L)\xd740 = 5\xd740 = 200. Sigma left as default so the OR backend uses full-sample volatility scaled by \u221a(1+L). This keeps orders small (matching lower demand) and reduces holding cost risk while the observed lead time remains 4.
