  "rationale": "a) World knowledge & product: SKU is womens swimwear bottoms; date 2019-02-25 (late Feb) precedes spring break and spring/summer season\u2014swimwear demand should ramp in coming weeks. b) Demand regime: historical unified samples [61,98,152,129,213] show an upward-skewed series with mean\u2248130 units/period and clear rising tail (most recent values 129,213). Use mean\u2248130 as baseline but bias upward for seasonal ramp. c) Lead time & missing orders: supplier promised LT=4 periods; no prior orders placed so no arrivals to infer. Assume actual LT may equal promised until concluded evidence. d) Inventory & pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=0 so nothing will arrive before demand occurs. Need to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand because orders placed now arrive after 4 periods and current period demand also occurs. e) Final order logic: target coverage = 5 periods \xd7 adjusted demand. Use baseline 130 \xd7 5 = 650 units to cover expected demand during lead/pipeline while maintaining service level through the spring ramp. Tradeoff: high holding cost ($1/unit/period) but stockouts early in season are costly to profit (profit $2/unit).
