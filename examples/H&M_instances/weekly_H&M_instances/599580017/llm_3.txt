Lead time: promised 4 periods and no arrival history yet, so assume promised lead time until contradictory conclude messages appear. Inventory/pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Decision logic: must cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand because orders arrive after decision and lead time = 4. Using the historical mean (\u2248131) and modest upward seasonality expectation for late Feb, forecast ~131 units/period; 5-period coverage \u2248 655 units. Balance profit ($4/unit) vs holding cost ($1/unit/period): ordering to cover ~5 periods minimizes stockouts given long lead time while avoiding excessive overstock. Place order of 655 units.",
