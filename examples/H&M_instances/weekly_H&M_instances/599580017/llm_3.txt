Supplier promised lead_time=0 but actual lead time is unknown and must be inferred from future conclude messages; orders could arrive same-period or be delayed/lost. Given high unit profit ($4) vs holding cost ($1/period), the cost of understock (lost sales) is relatively more punitive than modest holding cost. To balance risk of stockouts and holding cost, target expected demand for the upcoming period (~131 units) to meet likely demand spike as spring approaches while avoiding large excess inventory. Conservatively do not build extra safety stock because there is no confirmed lead-time delay yet; adjust in future periods as arrival evidence accrues.",
