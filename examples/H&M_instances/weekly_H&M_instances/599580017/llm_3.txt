Product: women's swim bottom \u2014 seasonal, likely increasing demand over coming months. Historical samples for SKU 599580017 = [61, 98, 152, 129, 213]; mean ~130 but high variance and evidence of upward trend (last value 213). Inventory/pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Promised lead_time=2 periods (orders placed now arrive in Period 3); we will not see arrival confirmation until Period 4. Holding cost is high relative to profit (Holding $1 vs Profit $2 per unit per period) so excess inventory is costly. Strategy: be conservative but ensure some supply for the upcoming seasonal lift. Because we cannot affect current-period demand and arrivals only come in 2 periods, order to cover expected demand starting in Period 3 while avoiding large holding costs. I choose a moderate order sized between the lower historical samples and the mean to balance stock availability vs holding penalty.",

Lead-time & arrivals: Promised lead time = 2 periods; Period-1 order (80) has not concluded yet (arrived=0 in Period-1 conclude) \u2014 this is expected for L>=1, so no confirmed arrival yet and no evidence of lost order or changed lead time.
