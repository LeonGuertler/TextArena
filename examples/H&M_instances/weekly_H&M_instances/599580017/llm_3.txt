  "rationale": "World/calendar: 2019-02-25 \u2192 late Feb, demand for swimwear typically rises entering spring/summer (spring break, warmer weather), so expect elevated demand ahead.

Historical demand samples for SKU 599580017: [61,98,152,129,213] \u2192 mean ~130 units/period and upward skew, so use ~130 as baseline forecast. Lead time: supplier promised 4 periods; no concluded arrivals in history to contradict this. Inventory/pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=0, so we cannot cover demand for the next 4 periods (orders placed now only arrive in Period 5). Decision logic: need to build pipeline so arrivals cover demand once lead time elapses. Following guidance to cover (L+1) periods with order+on-hand+in-transit, target coverage of 5 periods at forecast ~130 units \u2192 order 650 units. This balances avoiding severe stockouts when seasonal demand rises while recognizing holding cost; earlier periods' demand (Periods 1\u20134) cannot be recovered because of lead time.",
