Risk factors: swimwear is seasonal and we are in mid-March (demand likely to increase toward spring/summer), profit/holding tradeoff (profit=$2, holding=$1) favors service but not excessive holding. No concluded arrivals indicate no confirmed lead-time deviation or lost shipments yet. Decision: follow OR baseline recommendation of 134 units. Rationale: OR already targets base-stock for the review+lead horizon and limits swings; with pipeline equal to expected demand we only need a modest replenishment to maintain service given seasonality upside and positive profit margin.

============================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time: confirmed L=4 from concluded arrivals. Inventory: on-hand=790, in-transit=0. Demand: recent sustained low-demand regime (~47 units/period per Periods 31\u201340 and continued through Periods 41\u201344). Coverage target: (L+1)*demand \u22485*47 \u2248235 units. With 790 on-hand we already far exceed target (790 >> 235), so placing any order would increase holding cost without improving sales. OR recommended 558 uses promised L and historical higher-demand samples and ignores the recent sustained drop; therefore I override OR and order 0 units this period to avoid excess holding cost while current on-hand covers expected demand through lead time and beyond.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Ordering 0 (vs OR's 558): on-hand 790 >> required coverage \u2248235 (5\xd7~47/week recent demand), so no replenishment needed and avoids holding cost.",
