Lead time: supplier promised 4 periods; no concluded arrivals observed yet, so treat promised LT=4 for planning. Inventory/pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=0.

Balancing service vs. holding cost: with profit $4 and holding $1/period, stockouts are costly (lost profit) and swimwear seasonality suggests stocking ahead.
