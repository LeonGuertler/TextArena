Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. No on-hand or in-transit inventory and no concluded arrivals observed (no lead-time evidence). Historical demands = [694,576,685,715,774] (mean ~688.8). Promised lead time=4 has no contradictions in concluded history, so use default lead time and default demand estimates to let OR backend compute base-stock from full-sample mean/variance. This covers (1+L) periods of expected demand given empty inventory and avoids premature assumption of lost shipments.

LLM Rationale:
Period 2 (2019-02-18): on-hand=0, in-transit=808 (order placed in Period 1) and no concluded arrivals yet. Historical demands = [694,576,685,715,774] give a stable mean; no concluded lead-time observations so cannot infer actual lead time. Use promised lead time and default demand/volatility aggregation so the OR engine computes base_stock and cap from full-sample statistics and the promised L, ensuring pipeline + on-hand will be sized against (1+L) periods of demand.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). Historical demand samples: [694,576,685,715,774] (mean \u2248 688.8). On-hand=0, in-transit=1601 (matches orders 808+793). No concluded arrivals yet; cannot infer actual lead time from conclude messages. Promised lead time=4 should be used. Use default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR engine applies its base-stock formula with the full historical sample set. This is conservative given no evidence of a demand regime change and the large in-transit pipeline; avoids overreacting to missing concludes while keeping service coverage for L+1 periods.

Carry-over insight: Outstanding shipments: orders from Periods 1\u20132 (808,793) remain in-transit; no arrivals concluded yet\u2014monitor for lost shipments if arrivals fail to conclude after promised lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (2019-03-04). Historical sample mean ~688.8 units (samples [694,576,685,715,774]); recent concluded demands: Period1=671, Period2=673, Period3=539 showing a modest recent dip but no clear regime shift. On-hand=0, in-transit=2383 (orders from Periods1-3 remain in-transit); these arrivals are not yet past the promised 4-period lead time, so treat promised L as valid. Use default forecasting (backend (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to let OR engine compute base stock and cap while avoiding premature manual overrides given limited evidence of a sustained demand change or confirmed lead-time deviation. This balances service level (protect vs. high mean demand) against holding cost while we await arrival confirmations.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/11 (Period 5). Historical demand samples = [694,576,685,715,774]; on-hand=0, in-transit=3173 (sum of orders from Periods 1\u20134). No 'arrived' concluse messages yet (only up through Period 4), so by rules we cannot infer a lead-time change. Use promised lead time and population estimates: choose default L (promised), default mu_hat and default sigma_hat so OR backend uses full-sample mean/std scaled by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L). This is conservative given no concluded arrivals and preserves service-level gearing while avoiding ad-hoc shortening of lead time despite outstanding in-transit volume.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019/3/18): recent realized demand has fallen vs. older historical samples (period demands: P1=671, P2=673, P3=539, P4=447, P5=468). One concluded arrival (Period 5 conclude) shows Period 1 order arrived with lead_time=4, confirming the promised 4-period lead time for that shipment. Several orders (Periods 2\u20134) remain in-transit and may be delayed or lost if they fail to conclude after their promised lead time. To balance service and holding cost I use the observed lead-time average (calculate) = 4, and base demand estimates on the most recent 5 periods to capture the downshift in demand (recent_N N=5) for both mean and volatility so OR sets a lower base-stock than using older higher historical mean.

Carry-over insight: Outstanding shipments from Periods 2\u20134 remain in-transit with no conclude yet; Period 1 arrival confirmed lead_time=4. Flag these as possible lost/delayed if they fail to conclude after their promised lead time.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). On-hand=631, in-transit=1770. Two concluded arrivals confirm actual lead_time=4 (Period1\u2192P5, Period2\u2192P6). Recent demand has trended down from earlier peaks (recent demands: 671,673,539,447,468,502), so use a recent-window estimate to capture current regime. Use lead-time estimate from observed concludes (calculate). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect shorter-term demand pattern and reduce overstock risk given holding cost and existing large in-transit. This balances service vs. holding cost while remaining responsive to possible lost shipments (monitor older in-transit beyond promised LT).

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time confirmed = 4 periods (Period1 arrival in P5; Period2 arrival in P6).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). Recent demand samples = [694,576,685,715,774] (mean ~688). On-hand=902, in-transit=1303; pipeline + on-hand comfortably covers expected demand for next 5 periods but monitor in-transit for any non-conclusions. Concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=4 (P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7), so set L to be calculated from observed lead times to capture that confirmed regime. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7sample mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this balances service level (using full-sample stats with confirmed L) against holding cost given moderate on-hand inventory.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). Recent concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (arrivals from P1\u2013P4 each had W=4). On-hand=1132, in-transit=1298; no new missing-shipment signals beyond previously flagged in-transit. Historical demand samples = [694,576,685,715,774] (mean \u2248689). I select default methods so the OR engine uses promised L and full-sample demand statistics (conservative, stable estimate) while continuing to monitor in-transit orders for loss/delay. This balances service (use full-history mean \xd7 (1+L)) against holding cost given modest holding $1 vs profit $2.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15): On-hand=930, in-transit=1843. Concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=4 for orders placed in Periods 1\u20134 (arrivals in P5\u2013P8) and recent arrivals (P6\u2013P8) also match 4, so actual lead time is stable at 4. Outstanding in-transit since early periods flagged previously appear to have resolved for those batches; continue treating lead time as observed. Use calculated L to reflect observed lead times; use default demand aggregation (all samples) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to let OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample set given no strong demand regime change in the small sample. This balances service (capture 5-period demand) vs holding cost while acknowledging prior delayed arrivals.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). Demand history shows stable weekly demand with recent concluded arrivals indicating consistent lead_time=4. On-hand=726, in-transit=2036 \u2014 pipeline is large relative to weekly demand so maintain lead time estimate at 4 and use population stats for forecasting. Choose L by calculating observed lead times (all concluded arrivals show 4). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, balancing service level (profit $2 vs holding $1) without overreacting to short-term noise or possible earlier lost-orders (no recent missing concludes).

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time sustained at 4 periods (arrivals from Periods 1\u20136 concluded with lead_time=4).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-258.00

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/29 (Period 12). Recent realized demand has fallen sharply versus earlier samples (recent demands: periods 7\u201311 = 511,560,335,269,261 showing sustained lower demand). On-hand=780, in-transit=1905 (several prior large orders remain in pipeline but past behavior shows actual lead_time=4 consistently). Set L to default (promised 4) since concluded arrivals confirm a stable 4-period lead time. For mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N (N=5) to reflect the downward demand regime (capture last 5 observed demand samples) so the OR backend reduces target base-stock and variance to avoid excess holding cost while preserving service. This balances profit vs holding cost given Profit=$2 and Holding=$1.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift downward: recent 5-period demands (Periods 7\u201311 = 511,560,335,269,261) average substantially below earlier history; treat as new sustained lower-demand regime.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=1226, in-transit=1120. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=4 periods (orders from Periods 1\u20138 concluded with W=4), so use observed lead time. Recent demand has shifted down; last 5 concluded demands (Periods 7\u201311 = 511,560,335,269,261) imply a lower-demand regime. Set L to be calculated from observed lead times to lock in the confirmed L=4. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to scale forecast to the new lower regime across review+lead period. Use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. These settings make the backend target a base-stock tuned to the lower recent mean while keeping safety stock based on recent variability and the confirmed 4-period lead time, limiting excess holding given already-large on-hand plus in-transit.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13 (Period 14). Historical concluded arrivals show consistent actual lead_time = 4 periods; recent demand has shifted down: recent 5-period demands (Periods 7\u201311 = 511,560,335,269,261) are substantially lower than earlier samples. On-hand = 1663, in-transit = 442 \u2014 ample coverage today. To reflect the sustained lower-demand regime while keeping lead-time aligned with observed behavior, set L to default (promised=4), use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the most recent regime. This reduces target base-stock to match lower demand and limits excess holding cost given current high inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift downward confirmed: Periods 7\u201311 mean = 387 (511,560,335,269,261); treat as sustained lower-demand regime.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=1732, in-transit=184 \u2014 ample cover today; outstanding older shipments have all concluded with observed lead_time=4. Set L to promised (default=4) since actual lead time has been consistently 4. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor the forecast and volatility to the new lower-demand regime so OR backend reduces target base-stock and avoids excess holding costs.

Recent realized demands (Periods 12-16 = 339,241,189,375,533) average ~335, below earlier history; I treat the recent 5-period window as the current demand regime. Use promised lead time (default) since actual lead time has matched promise historically and no outstanding in-transit orders exist. Set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to anchor the (1+L)-period demand forecast to the current lower regime. Use sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent demand volatility rather than long-run volatility, improving service/holding tradeoff given high on-hand inventory.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:

Recent demand has shifted down: last 5 realized demands (Periods 13\u201317 = 241,189,375,533,451) average 357.8, well below early-period levels; historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 4 sustained. On-hand=557 + in-transit=555 = 1,112 units vs (L+1)-period demand forecast \u2248 5\xd7357.8=1,789 => pipeline shortfall. Use promised lead time (default L=4) since concluded history confirms L=4. Set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the new lower-demand regime. Set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices reduce over-ordering from high-demand past while keeping base-stock sized to cover 5 periods of the current lower-demand regime; they also rely on concluded arrivals (no evidence of new lost shipments) so L remains default.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24 (Period 20). On-hand=0, in-transit=1768. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time sustained at 4 periods; outstanding arrivals have been arriving on schedule when concluded. Demand regime shifted down earlier (Periods 7-11 mean=387) but more recent demand (Periods 15-19 = 375,533,451,462,358) suggests a higher short-run mean. To balance service vs holding cost I use the promised/default lead time (L=4) since concluded history supports L=4, and set demand estimates from the most recent 5 periods (N=5) to capture the latest regime while keeping samples >=3. sigma_hat also uses the recent 5 periods to reflect current volatility. This keeps orders responsive to recent demand while leveraging confirmed lead-time evidence to avoid over-ordering given high in-transit inventory.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019-07-15). Recent demand has shifted down vs earlier periods; latest visible demands (Periods 17-22 = 451,462,358,265,353,393) and earlier confirmed regime (Periods7-11) support using a recent-demand estimate. On-hand=403, in-transit=1171 \u2014 pipeline is large but some earlier orders were delayed then concluded with lead_time=4; recent arrivals (Periods17-18 concluded in P21-22) confirm actual lead_time=4. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses observed lead times (empirically 4) rather than the promised default. For demand I choose recent_N with N=5 to focus the forecast on the latest lower-demand regime and avoid overweighting older high-demand samples. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N (N=5) to capture current volatility. These choices reduce target base-stock to match the new lower demand while still respecting the observed 4-period lead time and the existing pipeline to avoid over-ordering.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-22 (Period 24). On-hand=653, in-transit=878. Actual lead time has been consistently 4 periods in concluded history; outstanding older orders resolved. Demand has shifted down since Period 7 (Periods 7\u201311 mean ~387) and recent periods (19\u201323 mean ~348) remain in the lower regime. To reflect the sustained lower-demand regime while retaining the correct lead-time assumption, use promised/default lead time and recent_N demand estimates over the post-changepoint regime (capture last 17 periods since the downturn began). This reduces order targets vs. using the full historical mean and helps limit ending inventory given holding cost; using recent volatility aligns safety stock with current variability. No evidence of new lost shipments in recent concludes.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=901 + in-transit=813 -> healthy pipeline but demand has been in a sustained lower regime since Period 12/14. Actual lead time has been consistently 4 periods in concluded history. I set L=default to trust promised lead time (matches observed). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new lower-demand regime using the most recent 5 demand observations (Periods 20-24 = 265,353,393,369,232). This reduces target base-stock to avoid excess holding cost while preserving service; recent volatility (sigma) is estimated from same 5-sample window to align safety stock with current variability.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Recent demand has settled well below early-history levels: last 5 demands (Periods 21-25 = 353,393,369,232,298) mean = 329. On-hand 603 + in-transit 813 = 1416 units \u2014 ample coverage for several periods under the lower regime, and past concluded messages show actual lead_time = 4 consistently. Use promised lead time to match observed sustained L=4, and base demand forecast on the recent 5-period regime to avoid over-ordering given high on-hand/pipeline. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) so OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7recent mean and volatility that reflect the lower regime, reducing future order quantities and holding cost while preserving service under observed demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift downward updated: Periods 21-25 mean = 329 (353,393,369,232,298); sustained lower-demand regime vs earlier mean=387 noted previously.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). Recent history shows a sustained downward demand regime (Periods 21-25 mean=329) and actual lead time has been stable at 4 periods. On-hand=294, in-transit=1033 (sufficient pipeline). Use promised lead time (default L=4). For demand forecast use recent_N over last 5 periods to capture the new lower-demand regime (mu_hat recent_N N=5). Use recent_N for sigma_hat with N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These settings reduce unnecessary inventory while preserving service given long stable LT and sufficient pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shifted downward: Periods 21-25 mean=329 (353,393,369,232,298); treat as sustained lower-demand regime.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/19 P28. Lead time has been consistently 4 periods in concluded history; use promised/default L. Recent demand regime is lower than early history \u2014 use recent 5-period demand to set demand forecast and volatility (captures latest downward shift and recent uptick at P27). On-hand=127 + in-transit=1119 = 1246 units; with L=4 the OR needs coverage for 5 periods \u2014 recent 5-period mean used so backend can size base stock appropriately given current lower-demand regime while remaining responsive to the P27 spike. No new evidence of lost shipments in the concluded history.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=110, in-transit=1220. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods; promised lead time remains appropriate. Recent demand has shifted lower compared with earliest history but shows some recovery in the last 5 periods (Periods 24\u201328 demand = 232,298,381,493,432; mean=367.2). I set L to default to use the promised (and historically confirmed) 4-period lead time. For mu_hat I use recent_N with N=5 to anchor the base-stock to the most recent regime (N chosen = 5 since the recent regime length \u22485). Sigma_hat uses default (all-sample std scaled by sqrt(1+L)) so the OR backend retains full-sample volatility while the mean uses the recent regime to reduce overstock risk. This balances service level vs holding cost given large in-transit inventory and a lower recent demand regime.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). Recent demand has declined vs earlier history (last 5 demands P25-29 = 298,381,493,432,396; mean=400). Lead time has been consistently observed =4 in concluded history. Several earlier orders experienced delayed visibility but recent concludes show steady 4-period lead time. To protect service while avoiding excess holding in the new lower-demand regime, set L to promised/default (4), set mu_hat using recent_N to reflect current lower mean demand (N=5), and set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture recent volatility. This also prevents the OR engine from over-ordering based on older, higher-demand samples and mitigates risk from any remaining in-transit uncertainty.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=0, in-transit=1777. Historical concludes show actual lead_time sustained at 4 periods; in-transit stock covers multiple future periods but arrivals are only observed with 1-period delay. Recent demand has shifted vs early history; to balance service (profit=$2) vs holding cost ($1) I use the promised/default lead time (4) and base forecasts on the most recent 5-period sample to capture current regime and recent spike/volatility. Using recent_N(5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the OR engine adapt quickly while the default L keeps timing consistent with observed arrivals.

Historical concluded arrivals show a sustained actual lead time = 4 periods; pipeline arrivals from recent orders should materialize on the 4-period cadence. Recent demand has shifted downward (sustained lower-demand regime in prior periods). To avoid excess holdings while maintaining service, use promised/default lead time and base demand on the recent low-demand regime (last 5 samples) so the OR backend targets a smaller base-stock.

Recent demand (Periods 28-32 = 432,396,740,708,707) shows a return to higher, volatile demand vs earlier downshift. I use default L to keep promised lead time (4) since concluded history confirms it. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the most recent demand regime and volatility (captures the recent spike/volatility). This biases base-stock toward meeting the current higher demand while sigma reflects recent variability; with large in-transit inventory this will let the OR engine cap orders appropriately and avoid unnecessary additional ordering while maintaining service.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30). On-hand=0, in-transit=2519. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent actual lead_time=4; promised lead time=4. Recent demand has spiked in the last 5 concluded periods (P29\u2013P33), but overall history includes multiple regimes; given consistent lead time and no new evidence of lost shipments (arrivals have been concluding at 4), use default lead-time and default demand aggregation so the OR engine applies the full sample mean/variance while respecting L=4. In-transit (2519) will be counted by pipeline; keeping defaults avoids overreacting to the short recent spike while letting the OR backend compute base_stock and cap from full-sample stats.

Carry-over insight: NEW: Recent sharp demand spike in Periods 29\u201333: demands = [396,740,708,707,1428], mean \u2248 796 over last 5 periods \u2014 this contrasts with prior lower-demand regime (means ~329\u2013387) and may reflect a short-term surge.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:

Date 2019-10-07 (Period 35). Recent demand shows a sharp short-term surge: last 5 demands (Periods 30-34 = 740,708,707,1428,748) average ~866. On-hand=0, in-transit=2472 (ample pipeline). Actual lead time has been consistently 4 periods in concluded history. To capture the current surge while OR backend retains promised L=4, set L=default so backend uses promised lead time; set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the recent spike in demand across the review+lead horizon; keep sigma_hat=default so volatility is estimated from full history scaled by sqrt(1+L). This biases orders upward to meet the surge but pipeline inventory (2472) should cover several periods, reducing risk of stockouts while balancing holding cost given holding=$1 and profit=$2.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). Recent demand has shown a sharp short-term surge (Periods 31-35 = 708,707,1428,748,606) so I bias forecast toward recent activity while trusting the confirmed 4-period actual lead time. On-hand=125 + in-transit=2980 = 3105 units (covers many periods at historical lows but may be short vs. recent surge). Set L=default to use promised lead time (actual historically =4). Set mu_hat=recent_N with N=5 to capture the recent high-demand regime (focus on last 5 demands). Keep sigma_hat=default so volatility uses full historical variance scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances service for the recent spike while using conservative volatility for safety given large pipeline.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). Recent demand has surged vs prior lower regime: last 5 demands (Periods 32\u201336 = 707,1428,748,606,581) average \u2248 814 with high variance. On-hand=367 + in-transit=3366 provides large pipeline cover (~4033 units). Actual lead time historically = 4 periods and promised lead time = 4; no evidence to deviate. To make the OR backend responsive to the recent surge while limiting excess holding, use recent demand stats (most recent 5-period window) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so base_stock and cap reflect the elevated mean and volatility. Keep L as default (promised=4) because concluded history shows consistent 4-period arrivals. This balances service (capture surge) against holding cost given profit=2, holding=1.

Carry-over insight: Spike extended: recent 5-period demands (Periods 32\u201336 = 707,1428,748,606,581) mean \u2248 814 and high variance; demand surge persists beyond earlier 29\u201333 window.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). Recent data show a sustained demand surge: last 5 demands (Periods 33\u201337 = 1428,748,606,581,643) mean \u2248 801 with high variance. Actual lead time has been consistently 4 periods in concluded history. On-hand=466, in-transit=3299 provides large pipeline but demand spike warrants forecasting using recent regime. Set L to promised (default=4) given sustained confirmations. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-mean, high-variance regime so the OR engine raises base-stock and cap appropriately to avoid stockouts during the surge while balancing holding cost.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/4 (Period 39). Recent history shows a sustained actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple concluded arrivals with lead_time=4). Demand has shown a recent surge (Periods ~29\u201336) but pipeline is very large. On-hand = 0, in-transit = 3708 units \u2014 sufficient coverage for multiple periods given typical demand. To remain consistent with observed lead time and let the OR engine use full historical variance, I keep promised lead time (default) and use default demand aggregation so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This avoids overreacting to the recent spike while respecting confirmed L=4 and prevents placing aggressive new orders into an already large pipeline.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Recent demand has shown a large spike earlier but last 5 realized demands (Periods 35-39 = 606,581,643,663,485) average \u2248596; actual lead time has been stable at 4 periods in concluded history. On-hand =754 and in-transit=2469 (total pipeline=3223) provides strong cover vs (L+1)-period demand; use promised lead time to keep consistency with observed sustained LT=4, and use recent 5-period demand statistics to capture the current elevated regime while keeping volatility estimate aligned with recent variance.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=1382, in-transit=1260. Historical concluded arrivals show a stable actual lead time = 4 periods (consistent arrivals from many past periods). Recent demand has risen relative to the prior low-regime: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 36\u201340) = [581,643,663,485,581], mean \u2248 590 with elevated variance. To reflect the sustained lead-time signal, use the promised/default lead time. To capture the recent upward demand level and current volatility, set demand forecast and volatility using the most recent 5 periods (N=5) so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over the recent window. This balances service (respond to the recent surge) against holding cost given already-large on-hand + pipeline.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/25 (Period 42). On-hand=1510, in-transit=963. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods; no new lost-shipment signals. Demand history contains a recent spike (Periods 29\u201336) but overall series includes earlier lower-regime; given stable observed LT=4 and mixed demand regime, use promised/default lead time and let OR backend compute demand pooling over (1+L) periods from full sample to avoid overfitting to the short spike. This balances service (keep safety via backend z*) vs. holding cost given large on-hand inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4190.00

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). Recent history shows a sustained actual lead time = 4 periods (concluded arrivals through Period 42). Inventory: on-hand 0, in-transit 683. Demand has been volatile with an extended surge from Periods 29\u201337 and a very large spike in Period 42 (3100 units) that exhausted inventory. To be robust to observed lead time reliability and to temper extreme single-period spikes while still reacting to elevated recent demand, I keep L at the promised/default (4). For demand level I use an EWMA to weight recent high demand but damp extreme outliers (EWMA_gamma=0.3). For demand volatility I use a recent-window estimate (last 5 periods) to capture the current high variance. These choices keep the OR backend using the observed 4-period lead time, raise the base stock to respond to elevated recent demand without overreacting to a one-period extreme, and ensure sigma reflects the current high variability so the capped order cap is meaningful given the surge and stockout risk.

Carry-over insight: New: Period 42 (2019-11-25) extreme demand spike = 3100 units that exhausted inventory; likely event-driven (Black Friday) \u2014 treat as short-term surge unless elevated demand persists in subsequent periods.

Historical concluded arrivals show sustained actual lead_time=4 periods; recent history includes a strong demand spike (Periods ~29\u201337 and Black Friday Period 42). To balance service vs holding given large pipeline and evidence of elevated recent demand, use promised lead time (default L) and set demand forecast using the most recent 5-period mean to capture the ongoing surge; keep sigma at default to let backend use full-sample volatility scaled by (1+L). This preserves service for the observed spike while letting the OR cap limit excessive same-period ordering against existing large in-transit stock.

Demand recently shows a large, volatile surge (including Black Friday spike) but regime is noisy; to balance service vs holding cost I keep L=default (promised 4) and use EWMA to weight recent elevated demand while damping the extreme outlier (gamma=0.3). Use default sigma (captures full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L)). This keeps orders responsive to recent surge but avoids extreme overstock if spike is short-lived.

Recent demand has been noisy (large Black Friday spike in P42) but the last several periods (P41\u2013P45) show elevated but volatile demand. To avoid overreacting to the single extreme spike while still responding to recent higher demand, use promised lead time (default) and an EWMA demand forecast (gamma=0.3) to smooth the surge.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). On-hand=0, in-transit=5116. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 periods; pipeline is large (5116) after recent large orders but Black Friday (P42) produced an extreme one-period spike (3100) that likely is transient. To avoid overreacting to the short-lived spike I keep L at the promised/default (4) and use an EWMA for mu_hat to weight recent demand while damping the singular Black Friday outlier (gamma=0.3). sigma_hat set to default to let the OR engine use full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances service (with ample pipeline) against holding cost given the recent large in-transit volume and event-driven demand spike.

Carry-over insight: Black Friday extreme spike (Period 42 demand=3100) is event-driven and short-lived; treat as transient unless elevated demand persists in subsequent periods.
