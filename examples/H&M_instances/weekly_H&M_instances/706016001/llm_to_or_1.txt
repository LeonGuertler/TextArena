Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019-02-11). Historical demands: [694, 576, 685, 715, 774], mean \u2248 688.8. On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no concluded arrivals so cannot infer actual lead time; use promised lead time. Choose L=default to keep promised 2-period policy. Use mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample, balancing service level vs holding cost given steady historical demand.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/2/18. On-hand=0, in-transit=808 (ordered in Period 1, arrived=0 in Period 1 conclude). No concluded arrivals yet => no evidence actual lead time differs from promised. Use promised lead time and historical demand samples [694,576,685,715,774] to set default demand estimates so backend uses full-sample mean/variance. This keeps policy conservative while awaiting arrival/conclude data and balances service level vs holding cost given profit=$2 vs holding=$1.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/2/25 (Period 3). Demand history shows samples [694,576,685,715,774] (mean=688.8). Inventory: on-hand=135, in-transit=793. Concluded arrivals show the order placed in Period 1 arrived in Period 2 with lead_time=1 (promised=2). I set L using recent_N to reflect the single observed lead-time=1. For forecasting I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to let the OR engine compute demand over the review+lead period while keeping variance scaling consistent given the chosen L. This balances service level (accounting for shorter observed lead time) vs holding cost given sizable in-transit inventory.

Carry-over insight: Observed actual lead time = 1 period (Period 2 conclude: arrived=808 units ordered on Period 1, lead_time was 1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $270.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (2019-03-04). Observed actual lead time = 1 period from Period 2 conclude. Current on-hand=0, in-transit=1270; recent arrival pattern: an order placed in Period 3 has not concluded (arrived=0) \u2014 may be delayed/lost but only one concluded lead-time observed so far. Use calculated lead time to reflect observed 1-period reality; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so OR backend applies (1+L) scaling to full sample mean/std given limited data and to maintain service while avoiding over-adjustment.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date=2019-03-11 (Period 5). Demand history samples=[694,576,685,715,774]. Observed arrivals show mixed lead times: order from Period 1 arrived in 1 period; order from Period 2 arrived in 2 periods. One recent order (Period 3 ordered=477) remains in-transit. To capture variable/uncertain lead time, set L method to 'calculate' so backend uses the average observed lead time. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level vs holding cost given limited data and mixed lead-time observations.

Carry-over insight: Observed lead times = [1,2] (Period2 conclude: L=1 for order on P1; Period4 conclude: L=2 for order on P2). Lead time is variable; average \u22481.5.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent concluded arrivals show variable lead times: Period2 conclude => L=1 (order P1); Period4 conclude => L=2 (order P2). Average recent lead time \u22481.5, so I use recent_N over the last 2 observed lead times to capture variability. Demand history (samples [694,576,685,715,774]) shows no clear demand regime shift, so use default demand and volatility estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to let the OR engine compute mu_hat and sigma_hat consistent with the chosen L. This approach increases planned pipeline to cover the longer recent average lead time while relying on full-sample demand stats to avoid overreacting to short-term noise. It also accounts for the in-transit 891 units when the OR backend computes order-up-to levels.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/25 (Period 7). Recent demand samples: [694,576,685,715,774], mean=688.8; recent realized lead times = [1 (P1->P2), 2 (P2->P4), 1 (P4->P5)] \u2192 variable but shorter than promised, average \u22481.33; choose explicit L=1.5 to reflect variability and avoid underordering. On-hand=0 + in-transit=1316; target pipeline for (1+L) periods \u2248 (1+1.5)*mean \u2248 2.5*688.8 \u22481722, so current pipeline is insufficient \u2192 backend should order up to base-stock. There are signs of lost/late shipments (some past orders never concluded); using a shorter, smoothed explicit L mitigates overstating pipeline while acknowledging variability. mu_hat and sigma_hat left as default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from history, balancing service level vs holding cost.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). Recent concluded history shows variable actual lead times (observed Ls = 1,2,1,2 \u2192 avg\u22481.5) and repeated stockouts (on-hand frequently zero). On-hand=0, in-transit=1195 (some of these correspond to orders with observed variable lead times). To account for variable/shorter-than-promised lead-time evidence while letting the backend compute demand scaling, I set L to be estimated from observed lead times (calculate). I use default demand/volatility scaling so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples \u2014 this balances higher target base-stock from elevated mean demand while letting the backend incorporate observed variability; it also avoids overreacting to short recent runs and keeps safety stock driven by the estimated L.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). On-hand=0, in-transit=851. Historical concluded lead times = [1,2] (avg \u22481.5) and remain variable; use recent_N to capture the most recent regime. Keep demand estimates broad (default) so OR backend uses all samples for (1+L) demand window; sigma default to reflect full-sample volatility. Large in-transit inventory plus L\u2248recent average will let backend offset pipeline and avoid excess ordering while preserving service.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15 (Period 10). Demand samples recent = [694,576,685,715,774]; on-hand=0, in-transit=1267. Concluded lead times observed = [1,2,1,2,2] (Periods 2,4,5,7,8) showing variable lead time with recent average \u22481.6 and occasional 2-period arrivals; some orders previously returned arrived late or not at promised LT, so model should reflect variable LT. I set L to recent_N (N=5) to capture the current average lead time. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples) respectively, letting the engine produce a base-stock that balances the $2 profit vs $1 holding cost while accounting for the longer/more-variable pipeline and existing in-transit units.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22. Recent realized demands have trended down from earlier highs (recent 5 demands = [502,511,560,335,269], mean\u2248435). Inventory: on-hand=24, in-transit=974 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times (from conclude messages): [1,2,1,2,2,3] (6 observations) \u2014 variable and rising recently. I choose L via recent_N using all 6 observed lead times to capture the current variable/higher lead-time regime. For demand forecast (mu_hat) I use recent_N with N=5 to focus the (1+L)-period demand forecast on the most recent demand regime (captures the downshift). For sigma_hat I also use recent_N N=5 to capture recent volatility. These choices keep orders responsive to the recent lower demand while accounting for longer/more variable lead time; large in-transit inventory reduces immediate ordering urgency, so recent-based forecasts prevent over-ordering while the L estimate protects against understock if lead times remain elevated.

Carry-over insight: Lead time regime has become variable and trending higher: observed lead times = [1,2,1,2,2,3] (Periods 2-10 concludes); recent average \u22481.83.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). Recent demand mean ~688.8 (samples [694,576,685,715,774]). On-hand=179, in-transit=558 => pipeline total 737, which is insufficient if lead time is >=2 given typical per-period demand ~689. Observed lead times have trended higher and variable (recent avg \u22481.83 with values [1,2,1,2,2,3]); to be conservative I set L explicitly to 2. Using mu_hat default and sigma_hat default lets the OR engine compute (1+L)*sample mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from full history, producing a base-stock that covers review+lead demand while default sigma preserves uncertainty scaling. This balances holding cost vs service given elevated/variable lead times and current pipeline shortage for a multi-period lead time.

LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). Historical demand samples mean=688.8 (samples=[694,576,685,715,774]). Observed lead times recent sequence = [1,2,1,2,2,3] (Periods 2-11 concludes) \u2192 recent average \u22481.83 and rising variability; on-hand=0, in-transit=1361 (\u22482 periods of demand at mean). To capture the higher, variable lead-time regime use recent_N for L (N=6). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7historical mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std, giving a conservative replenishment that accounts for longer recent lead times while letting the backend compute safety stock tradeoff using profit/holding costs.

LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=562, in-transit=558 \u2192 pipeline=1120. Historical demands: [694,576,685,715,774] (mean\u2248688.8). Observed lead times have been variable and trending higher (recent observed sequence [1,2,1,2,2,3], recent average\u22481.83). I set L via recent_N to capture the most recent variable lead-time regime (N=6). For demand I use recent_N over the 5 available demand samples to reflect current demand level without over-weighting older data. Sigma left as default so backend scales volatility by \u221a(1+L). These choices produce a base_stock tuned to recent higher/variable lead times while mu_hat reflects the current demand mean; together they help the OR engine raise safety stock for uncertain lead time but avoid overstating demand.

On-hand 373 + in-transit 558 = 931 units \u2014 sufficient to cover near-term demand but lead-time volatility risks stockouts if shipments are delayed. I set L explicit to 1.83 to reflect observed lead-time regime > promised 2 variability (so OR backend will account for longer effective pipeline). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, letting the statistical base-stock policy balance service level vs holding cost given the adjusted L.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27, on-hand=0, in-transit=1167. Historical demand samples [694,576,685,715,774] show stable high weekly demand (mean\u2248688.8). Observed lead times have been variable and trending slightly above 1.5 (recent average \u22481.83) with occasional 3-period delays. To be conservative versus lost/longer shipments, set lead time explicitly to 2 (matches promised and close to recent average). Use default demand and volatility calculations so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample; this leverages all data and the chosen L to size safety stock while keeping parameters simple given limited samples and variable lead times.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10 (Period 18). Demand history shows elevated, variable weekly demand with recent demands ~241\u2013533 and historical seed samples [694,576,685,715,774]. Lead time regime has been variable and trending higher (recent average \u22481.8), and current inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=1017. To avoid stockouts given uncertain/lengthening lead times, use a conservative lead-time estimate of 2 periods (matches promised and rounds up recent avg). Use default demand/volatility estimates so the OR engine computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from samples; this balances service level vs holding cost while the engine's capped ordering will limit overstocks despite large in-transit units.

Carry-over insight: Lead time regime variable and trending higher; observed lead times (Periods 2-10 concludes) = [1,2,1,2,2,3], recent average \u22481.83 -> treat LT as elevated/variable.

I choose L=recent_N (N=6) to capture the elevated/variable lead-time regime. mu_hat and sigma_hat use default (backend will scale (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR engine computes base-stock with the adjusted L while relying on full-sample demand stats.

Use default demand sizing so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) to leverage full demand history [694,576,685,715,774] given no strong demand changepoint; sigma_hat default to reflect historical volatility.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:

To be conservative versus lost/late shipments, set lead time explicitly to 2 (matches promised and accounts for observed elevation). Demand history samples mean = 688.8 (N=5); use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std with L=2.

To avoid stockouts given unpredictable arrivals and a promised lead time of 2, I set lead time explicitly to 2 to align with promised and elevated observed LT. I set mu_hat explicitly to 2100 units (covers (1+L) demand horizon with a buffer above historical mean demand \u2248689*3=2067) to protect service level given variability and current zero on-hand. I keep sigma_hat as default so OR backend uses sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). These choices bias toward higher safety stock to balance lost-sales cost (profit $2) vs holding cost $1.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-15 (Period 23). On-hand=0, in-transit=2189. Historical concluded lead times show a variable, elevated regime (observed Ls = [1,2,1,2,2,3], recent average \u22481.83) so use a recent average for L to capture variability. Demand samples (provided history) show no recent clear demand regime shift; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples. This balances higher lead-time uncertainty while avoiding overfitting demand volatility. Using recent_N for L helps the OR engine size orders to cover the longer/more-variable pipeline; default mu/sigma let the capped ordering cap limit excessive shipments given high in-transit.

Carry-over insight: Lead time regime elevated and variable; recent observed lead times = [1,2,1,2,2,3], recent average \u22481.83 (treat LT as higher/variable).

I leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR backend computes demand across review+lead using all historical demand samples while applying the chosen L; this balances service (by increasing coverage for longer LT) vs holding cost conservatively given existing on-hand + large in-transit.

Carry-over insight: Lead time regime elevated and variable; recent observed lead times = [1,2,1,2,2,3], recent average \u22481.83; treat LT as higher/variable.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Demand has been variable; on-hand=56, in-transit=1532. Concluded lead times from history = [1,2,1,2,2,3] (recent 6) \u2192 recent average \u22481.83 and LT regime is elevated/variable. To capture higher/variable lead time I set L via recent_N over the last 6 observed lead times. Demand forecast and volatility use defaults so the OR engine applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all demand samples; given large pipeline this avoids overreacting to short-term demand noise while letting the backend increase safety stock for longer LT.

Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=0, in-transit=1532. Historical concluded lead times are variable and trending higher (recent observed series avg \u22481.8), shipments have sometimes arrived late or after promised LT=2. To let the OR engine learn the empirical LT distribution I choose 'calculate' for L (average of observed lead times). Demand history mean is stable (~689); use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This balances service (capture elevated LT) while avoiding manual overstating of demand.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). Recent demand has moderated vs earlier high samples: last 5 period demands \u2248 [393,369,232,298,381], mean \u2248334.6/unit/period. Lead time regime has been elevated and variable (recent observed average \u22481.83); to be conservative I set L=2. On-hand=0, in-transit=1532 which at recent mean demand covers ~4.6 periods, so we can avoid aggressive ordering. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the current lower-demand regime and recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices reduce overstock risk while respecting elevated/variable lead time and the visible pipeline.

Demand samples seed mean=688.8. To account for elevated/variable LT use recent_N for L (N=6) so backend uses observed recent LT average; keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full demand history, providing a straightforward adjustment for longer effective review+lead demand while preserving statistical dispersion for safety stock.

Historical observed lead times = [1,2,1,2,2,3] (recent average \u22481.83) indicating an elevated/variable lead-time regime and several delayed/lost arrivals previously. Recent demand samples = [694,576,685,715,774] (mean used). To capture the higher/variable LT I set L by averaging the 6 most recent observed lead times (recent_N N=6). I set mu_hat using the recent 5 demand samples (recent_N N=5) to reflect current demand level over the review+lead period. sigma_hat uses default historical volatility scaled for (1+L). These choices raise target base-stock to protect service against the longer/variable lead times while letting the OR backend cap orders to limit excess holding costs.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). Recent demand samples show mean \u2248688.8 (samples: [694,576,685,715,774]). On-hand=0, in-transit=1532. Historical concludes show variable/elevated lead times (recent average \u22481.83); to be conservative I set L explicitly to 2 periods to protect against longer arrivals and lost shipments. Using mu_hat=default lets the OR backend compute (1+L)*mean across all samples (captures full review+lead demand). sigma_hat=default lets backend scale demand volatility by sqrt(1+L). With L=2 this raises target base-stock to cover 3 periods of demand; given in-transit=1532 (~\u22480.78\xd73-period mean of 2066) we expect to order to top up according to backend policy while controlling holding cost.

To account for that variability I use a recent-average lead time (recent_N, N=6). Demand history seed (five-sample history) used for demand forecast (use recent_N over the 5 documented demand samples). Sigma left to default to capture full-sample volatility. These settings raise target base-stock to protect service given elevated/variable LT while keeping sigma conservative for the OR cap calculation.

Demand baseline seeded by provided historical samples; no robust, validated changepoint in demand series that I can reliably quantify here, so use default demand/volatility calculations ((1+L)\xd7mean, sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR engine applies its statistical base-stock formula while using the inferred lead time.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07). Recent realized demand has jumped in late Sep (Periods 30-34: 740,708,707,1428,748) vs earlier samples; on-hand=0, in-transit=1532. Lead time has been elevated and variable historically; to avoid understock given recent demand surge and variable LT, use promised lead time (default L=2) so OR backend assumes standard LT while we push higher targets via demand inputs. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 (most recent 5 demands) to capture the late-September demand spike and higher volatility, so base-stock increases to protect service level while capping prevents runaway orders. This balances service (avoid stockouts given in-transit may be delayed/lost) against holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Recent demand regime shifted higher in late Sep: last 5-period mean=866.2 vs earlier historical mean\u2248689; treat demand as elevated and more volatile.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:

Observed lead times have been variable and trending higher (recent average \u22481.83). To protect service while accounting for elevated/uncertain LT and demand, set L explicitly to 1.83 (captures longer/variable lead time), use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to base the (1+L) forecast on the most recent high-demand regime, and recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. This increases target base stock to cover the new demand level and higher LT while keeping variance estimate based on the latest regime.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
2019-10-21: demand has shifted higher since late Sep (recent 5-period mean \u2248866.2) and lead times have been elevated/variable (recent observed LT avg \u22481.83). On-hand=0, in-transit=2834 (covers ~3.3 weeks at elevated demand). To target service while limiting holding cost I set lead time to recent observed average (explicit L=1.83) so OR backend scales review+lead period correctly, set mu_hat explicitly to (1+L)*recent_mean = 2.83*866.2 \u22482451.35 to reflect the elevated demand over the review+lead window, and keep sigma_hat=default so backend computes volatility from full history adjusted by sqrt(1+L). This balances higher target stock for elevated demand/longer LT while relying on backend volatility estimate to cap order size and limit overstock given substantial in-transit inventory.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/10/28 (Period 38). On-hand=0, in-transit=2834. Lead times have been elevated and variable recently (observed series [1,2,1,2,2,3], recent avg \u22481.83) so I use a recent average for L to reflect this regime. Demand shifted higher in late September (recent 5-period mean \u2248866 vs historical \u2248689) and volatility rose; I therefore set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 samples to capture the new mean and variability. These choices increase target base-stock to protect service level under longer/variable lead times while using recent demand to avoid overreacting to older low-demand history; using recent_N for sigma also raises safety stock for observed higher volatility. Pipeline (2834) is large but subject to observed variable arrivals; these parameters hedge against late or lost shipments.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). Recent history shows elevated/variable lead times (recent average \u22481.8) and a higher demand regime since late Sep (recent 5-period mean \u2248866). Current on-hand=639, in-transit=1532 (ample pipeline). To be conservative on lead time I set L explicit=2 (promised LT and near recent avg). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the late-September uptick when mean rose; same recent_N (N=5) for sigma to reflect increased volatility. These choices bias orders toward meeting elevated demand while the OR backend will compute base_stock and cap using the supplied L, mu_hat, sigma_hat estimates.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/11 (Period 40). Recent demand elevated and variable with mixed spikes in Sep; on-hand=154 and in-transit=1532 (ample pipeline). Observed lead times from concluded history are variable and slightly below/around promised 2 (recent average \u22481.83) so keep effective lead time at the promised 2 to match supplier promise and OR assumptions. Use recent demand (most recent 5 periods) to capture the latest regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat so orders reflect current demand rather than older low-demand history. This balances service level (using recent mean) against holding cost given large pipeline; keeping L=explicit 2 ensures backend uses promised lead time while mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_N adapt to higher recent demand.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). On-hand=0, in-transit=1685. Historical concluded lead times show a variable, elevated regime (recent observed LT series \u2248 [1,2,1,2,2,3], avg \u22481.83). Demand has shown recent regime shifts; use most recent 5 periods to capture current demand level. Set L using recent_N to reflect variable/higher recent lead times (use last 6 observed Ls). Set mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 to anchor forecast to the latest demand regime. Use default sigma_hat to let backend scale variability across (1+L). These choices increase planned pipeline to cover the longer, variable lead time while keeping volatility treatment consistent with historical data and the OR engine's formulas.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/25 (Period 42). On-hand=0, in-transit=1685. Historical concludes show lead times elevated and variable (recent observed avg \u22481.8) and a demand regime shift higher since late Sep (recent 5-period mean elevated). To balance service vs holding cost: set lead time explicitly to the promised/operational 2 to avoid under-ordering given variable LT and lost-shipment risk; use recent_N (5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the elevated recent demand and volatility so the OR engine raises the base stock accordingly. This approach hedges against stockouts while limiting excess holding by using recent demand statistics rather than the full historical average.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). On-hand=0, in-transit=1806. Historical lead times have trended higher/variable (recent average \u22481.83). Demand regime shifted higher around late Sep (recent higher mean/volatility). To protect service against elevated/variable lead time and recent demand uplift, set lead time explicit to 1.83. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the most recent regime (captures post-shift demand and the large recent spike), so the OR backend will raise base stock while keeping variance estimates current. This balances service (avoid stockouts given long/variable LT and high recent demand) versus holding cost by restricting to recent data rather than all-time historical smoothing.

Lead times have been elevated and variable recently (observed sequence avg \u22481.8), and demand regime increased since late Sep (recent 5-period mean materially above historical). To avoid over-ordering given large in-transit, keep lead time assumption conservative (explicit L=2). Use recent 5-period demand stats for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the elevated, more volatile regime while letting the backend cap orders versus pipeline.

To be conservative versus variable LT and recent high demand, set L explicitly to 2. For demand forecast use recent_N (capture the elevated regime) with N=5 (recent 5-period mean reflects higher demand). Use recent_N for sigma_hat with N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias orders upward to protect service under elevated/variable lead time while keeping variability estimates tied to the most recent regime.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019-12-23). On-hand=843, in-transit=2678. Historical concludes show variable, elevated lead times (recent observed lead times = [1,2,1,2,2,3], recent average \u22481.83) and a sustained demand shift upward since late Sep (recent 5-period mean \u2248866 vs earlier \u2248689). To balance service (avoid stockouts given long/variable LT) against holding cost, I use a recent-N estimate for L to capture elevated variable lead time, and recent-N demand stats (N=5) to reflect the new, higher demand regime and its volatility.

Carry-over insight: Lead time regime elevated and variable; recent observed lead times = [1,2,1,2,2,3], recent average \u22481.83; treat LT as higher/variable. Demand regime shifted higher in late Sep: recent 5-period mean \u2248866 vs historical mean \u2248689; treat demand as elevated and more volatile.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/30. Recent demand regime elevated (late-Sep+); on-hand=1148, in-transit=1898 so pipeline is large. Observed lead times have been variable and elevated (recent average \u22481.83) so use inferred LT rather than promised. Choose L via calculate to let backend use observed concludes. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the higher recent demand regime (recent 5-period mean elevated) so base stock responds to current demand/volatility while avoiding over-reacting to older low-demand periods. No evidence of lost shipments beyond accounted in pipeline; parameters aim to maintain service while limiting holding cost given substantial on-hand + in-transit.
