Planning horizon: an order placed now would arrive in Period 50, so it must cover demand from P50 onward. Pipeline 2900 \u2248 covers ~4.3 periods at ~670/day; this provides sufficient coverage for the next several periods. Cost tradeoff: profit $4/unit vs holding $1/unit/period \u2014 holding is costly relative to profit, so avoid excess inventory. No evidence of a new sustained demand or lead-time change. Decision: place no new order this period to avoid unnecessary holding costs; rely on in-transit supply.",
