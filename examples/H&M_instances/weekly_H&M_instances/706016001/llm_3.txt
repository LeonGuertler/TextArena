{
  "rationale": "a) World/calendar: Period 47 is 2019-12-30 \u2014 late December holiday season; recent weeks (Dec) showed elevated demand (Periods 42\u201345: 582, 674, 680, 657; P46=475 after big Dec 2 spike P42=3100 outlier). Expect high season demand around ~650\u2013700 rather than the low summer regimes. b) Demand regime: Carry-over history confirms a recent high-demand regime (periods ~30+ with many weeks ~600\u2013750); no new regime shift in the last 3+ periods. c) Lead time / orders: Lead time confirmed 0 periods (all past orders arrived same period); in-transit=0, so any order placed now will arrive this period and be available for Period 47 demand. d) Inventory/pipeline: On-hand=328, no in-transit. Target service: cover expected period demand \u2248 650\u2013700 units. e) Final order logic: Order enough to bring available inventory to roughly 700 units to meet high-season demand while limiting leftover holding cost. Required = 700 \u2212 328 = 372 units. ",
