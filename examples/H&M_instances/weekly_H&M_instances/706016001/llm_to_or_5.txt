Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. SKU 706016001 with past demands [694,576,685,715,774] (mean \u2248 689). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no concluded arrivals observed so actual lead time unknown. Use promised lead time and population statistics: set L to default (promised=4) and use default demand/volatility calculations so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples. This balances service (high demand mean) against holding cost given limited information and no evidence of lead-time shifts or lost shipments.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/2/18 (Period 2). On-hand=0, in-transit=808 (ordered in Period 1). No concluded arrivals yet (promised L=4), so actual lead time cannot be inferred. Demand history samples = [694,576,685,715,774] (mean=688.8). I keep L at the promised default to avoid falsely shortening/lengthening lead time given no arrival evidence. Use default demand aggregation and volatility (all-sample mean/std scaled by (1+L)) so the OR backend computes base-stock from full-sample stats and the promised lead time; this balances service level (using full historical mean) vs holding cost given current large in-transit position.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). Recent observed demands: [694,576,685,715,774], mean=688.8. On-hand=0, in-transit=1601 (808+793 from Periods 1\u20132). Promised lead time=4 and no concluded arrivals yet; not overdue (orders placed in P1/P2 would arrive in P5/P6). No evidence to change lead time or demand regime. Use default lead time (promised) to keep OR engine aligned with contract. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7sample mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7sample std (captures current historical demand and uncertainty). This balances service level (using full-sample mean) against holding cost given modest profit/holding ratio.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (2019-03-04). Recent demand baseline unchanged: historical samples [694,576,685,715,774] mean=688.8. All three prior orders (Periods 1-3) remain in-transit (sum=808+793+782=2383) and no arrivals have been observed in conclude messages \u2192 evidence of delayed shipments (possible lead-time > promised or shipments lost). To avoid overreacting to unconfirmed lead-time changes (we only observe arrivals with conclude messages) and because large pipeline already exists, use promised lead time (default) so OR backend leverages its known L=4. Use default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and default volatility so the backend computes base_stock and cap from full-sample stats while accounting for the sizeable in-transit pipeline. This balances service level (protect against demand) with holding cost given large outstanding orders.

Carry-over insight: Delayed arrivals: orders from Periods 1-3 (808,793,782) remain in-transit with arrived=0; sum in-transit=2383 \u2192 probable supplier delay or lost shipments. Monitor for future conclude messages to confirm actual lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Multiple consecutive orders (Periods 1-4) have arrived=0 and in-transit is large (3173), indicating supplier delays or lost shipments. Promised L=4 appears too optimistic; I extend lead time to reduce risk of stockouts when those shipments remain delayed. Use default demand estimates so OR backend uses full historical samples to compute base_stock and cap given the adjusted L.

Carry-over insight: Delayed arrivals: orders from Periods 1-4 remain in-transit with arrived=0; sum in-transit large (3173) \u2192 probable supplier delay or lost shipments. Monitor for future conclude messages to confirm actual lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $596.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). On-hand=340, in-transit=3174. Period 5 conclude shows arrived=808 (ordered P1) with lead_time=4 => actual lead time confirmed at 4 periods (matches promised). Pipeline large but arrival of P1 suggests shipments are progressing; remaining in-transit likely to arrive on their promised schedule. Use default lead time and default demand statistics so OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history, balancing service level against holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time confirmed = 4 periods (evidence: Period 5 conclude: arrived=808 ordered on Period 1, lead_time was 4). Previous multi-period non-arrivals resolved for Period 1; continue to monitor remaining in-transit for confirms.

Daily Reward (R_t): $373.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date=2019-03-25 (Period 7). Recent concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 (arrivals in Periods 5 and 6 were orders from Periods 1 and 2 with lead_time=4). Demand has declined versus the earlier samples (recent period demands: 671,673,539,447,468,502) \u2014 I treat the recent lower regime as most relevant. I set L by calculating observed lead times to reflect confirmed L=4. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to anchor the (1+L)-period forecast and volatility to the most recent demand regime so the OR engine reduces overstocks while maintaining service, given large in-transit balance and holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (evidence: Period 5 conclude: arrived=808 ordered on Period 1, lead_time=4; Period 6 conclude: arrived=793 ordered on Period 2, lead_time=4). Recent demand regime has softened vs earlier samples (recent demands ~447\u2013673 vs earlier ~694\u2013774).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01): demand has softened recently vs earlier high samples. Concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 (evidence: Period 5 conclude: arrived=808 ordered P1, LT=4; Period 6 conclude: arrived=793 ordered P2, LT=4; Period 7 conclude: arrived=782 ordered P3, LT=4). On-hand=902, in-transit=1599; pipeline plus on-hand covers several periods. Set L based on observed lead times to match confirmed LT=4. Use recent demand regime (periods 4\u20137: 447,468,502,511) for mu_hat and sigma_hat (regime_length=4 \u2192 N=4) so forecasts reflect softened demand and reduce excess aging inventory while maintaining service.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). Recent demand has softened versus earlier high samples (recent period demands ~447\u2013560 vs earlier 671\u2013774). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods (Period 5\u20138 concludes show orders from Periods 1\u20134 arriving with lead_time=4). On-hand=1132 + in-transit=809 provides ample cover near-term but demand regime lower; I set L to be calculated from observed lead-times to lock in confirmed L=4. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus forecasting on the softened recent regime (last 5 demand observations) so the OR backend reduces target base-stock and volatility estimates to avoid excess holding costs while preserving service.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/15 (Period 10). Actual lead time has been confirmed at 4 periods from concluded arrivals (Periods 5-9 show arrivals from Orders placed 1-5 with lead_time=4). Recent demand regime has softened vs earlier high samples: recent demands (Periods 5-9) = [468,502,511,560,335], mean\u2248475.2. To protect service over the review+lead window (L+1=5) while avoiding excess holding, set L to promised (confirmed) 4. For demand forecast use recent_N with N=5 to capture the lower recent demand regime ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 samples = 5\xd7475.2). Volatility should also reflect recent variability, so choose recent_N N=5 for sigma_hat. These parameters align the OR backend's base-stock calculation with the now-confirmed lead time and the softer recent demand, reducing overstock risk while maintaining service.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-799.00

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). On-hand=1337, in-transit=852. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4 (evidence: Periods 5-9 concludes: arrivals from Periods 1-5 all with lead_time=4) so I set L to be inferred from observed lead times. Demand has softened since Period 4 (pre-change samples ~671\u2013673\u2013694\u2013774 vs recent lower demands 447\u2013335\u2013269); I therefore base mu_hat and sigma_hat on the recent lower-demand regime to avoid over-ordering while maintaining service. Using recent_N (N=7) captures the post-changepoint demand pattern and recent volatility. This balances service level against holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1 and mitigates risk from past delayed/lost shipments by relying on observed lead-time evidence rather than optimistic promised arrivals.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). Actual lead time has been repeatedly observed as 4 periods (concluded arrivals from Periods 5-9 trace back to orders on Periods 1-5); use calculate for L to capture observed LT=4. Recent demand has softened versus initial samples (recent demands ~511,560,335,269,261); I'll base forecast on the most recent regime to avoid overstock. On-hand=1076 + in-transit=972 covers near-term demand, but using recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat reduces the (1+L)-period forecast and volatility to reflect the lower recent demand, balancing service level and holding cost.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). On-hand=737, in-transit=995. Actual lead time has been confirmed as 4 periods from conclude messages (orders placed Periods 1-4 arrived with lead_time=4). Recent demand regime softened vs earlier high samples: recent demands (Periods 8-12) = [560,335,269,261,339]. To reflect confirmed L=4 and lower recent demand, set L to default (promised 4), use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to forecast (1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 demands, and recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. This reduces excess stock while maintaining service given lead time confirmation and downstream lower demand.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time confirmed = 4 periods (evidence: Period 5 conclude: arrived=808 ordered on Period 1, lead_time=4; Period 6 conclude: arrived=793 ordered on Period 2, lead_time=4; Period 7/8 confirms for Periods 3/4).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13 Period 14. Recent concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 periods and supplier disruptions have resolved for earlier orders. Recent demand has softened compared with the older seed samples (recent demands ~241\u2013339 vs earlier ~694\u2013774). I set L=default (promised 4). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the new, lower-demand regime (using the last 5 observed demands: Periods 9-13 = [335,269,261,339,241]). This keeps the OR base-stock tuned to current demand and reduces overstock risk while maintaining service given confirmed LT=4.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (evidence: multiple conclude messages: Period5 arrived=808 ordered P1 LT=4; Period6 arrived=793 ordered P2 LT=4; Period7/8 confirms for P3/P4; Period13 arrived=569 ordered P9 LT=4).

On-hand=1159, in-transit=292; demand regime has softened vs early high samples (recent demands ~189\u2013339 vs earlier 694\u2013774). To respect proven LT and capture lower recent demand, keep L at promised (default) and base demand estimates on recent samples. Choose recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the softer, lower-variance recent regime and avoid over-ordering that increases holding cost while preserving service with the OR base-stock calculation.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=904, in-transit=172 \u2192 ample coverage vs short-term demand but pipeline low. Actual lead time has been repeatedly confirmed as 4 periods in concluded messages; use promised lead time. To keep responsiveness to the new lower-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (captures the recent reduced mean and volatility).

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). On-hand=92, in-transit=957. Multiple conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods; recent demand has softened vs early samples. To reflect confirmed LT=4 I ask backend to compute L from observed leads. For demand I use a recent-window estimate (N=5, Periods 13-17 demands = 241,189,375,533,451) to capture the new lower-demand regime when computing mu_hat and sigma_hat so base-stock and cap are tuned to current demand and avoid excess holding.

Carry-over insight: Recent sustained regime shift: demand softened in recent periods (Periods 13-17 mean \u2248 357 vs earlier samples ~694\u2013774); actual lead time confirmed = 4 periods (multiple conclude messages).

Multiple conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 4 periods, so use promised/default lead time. Current inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=1551 (several previous orders concluded at LT=4). I set L=default to reflect confirmed 4-period LT; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=5 (captures the most recent softened regime ~Periods 13\u201317) so the OR engine targets (1+L)\xd7recent mean and recent volatility, reducing excess stock while preserving service for current lower demand.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today 2019-06-24 (Period 20). On-hand=0, in-transit=2137. Historical concloses confirm actual lead time = 4 periods. Demand has softened in recent periods (last 5 demands: 375, 533, 451, 462, 358; mean \u2248 436). To balance service vs holding cost I keep L as promised (use default = 4) and set demand estimates using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the new lower-demand regime; sigma_hat also recent_N (N=5) to capture recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Recent sustained demand softening: last 5-period mean \u2248 436 (periods 15-19 demands 375,533,451,462,358). Actual lead time confirmed = 4 periods.

Recent demand regime has softened vs early high samples; last 5-period mean \u2248414 (Periods 16-20 demands 533,451,462,358,265). To align ordering with the softer recent demand while preserving 4-period coverage, set L to default (promised=4) and use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes demand across review+lead using the most recent regime (N=5).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019/7/8). Recent demand regime has softened vs the original historical samples: last 5 demands (Periods 17-21) = [451,462,358,265,353], mean \u2248 378 units/period. On-hand=339 + in-transit=1478 => pipeline=1817 units. With confirmed lead time = 4 (L+1=5 review+lead horizon), expected demand \u2248 5\xd7378 \u2248 1890, so pipeline slightly below needed cover. To reflect the recent lower-demand regime and keep orders responsive to current demand while avoiding excess holding cost, set L=default (promised), use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes base stock and cap from the recent regime statistics.

Carry-over insight: Recent sustained demand softening: Periods 17-21 mean \u2248 378 units (451,462,358,265,353); actual lead time confirmed = 4 periods (multiple conclude messages).

LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22). On-hand=757, in-transit=774. Multiple conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 4 periods. Recent demand regime has softened vs earlier history, so use recent (last 5) samples to set demand forecast and volatility to reflect current lower mean/variance. Use promised/default lead time to match confirmed LT and avoid under-ordering given outstanding pipeline and 4-period arrival timing.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/29 (Period 25). Multiple concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods; supplier behavior matches promised lead time. Recent demand regime has softened vs earlier high samples \u2014 last 5-period demands (Periods 20-24) = [265,353,393,369,232], mean \u2248322. To keep safety appropriate to the softer regime while respecting LT=4, I use default lead time (promised 4) and set demand estimates using recent_N (N=5) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the lower recent mean and volatility. This reduces excess holding while maintaining service under the observed LT.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple conclude messages through Period 24). Recent sustained demand softening: Periods 20-24 mean \u2248322 units (265,353,393,369,232).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/5 (Period 26). Recent history shows actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple conclude messages). On-hand = 525, in-transit = 857; no outstanding long-overdue shipments remaining unconfirmed. Demand has softened vs earlier regime \u2014 recent 5-period demands (Periods 21-25 = 353,393,369,232,298) average \u2248 329 units. To match the confirmed L=4 and the softer recent demand, set lead time to promised default and base demand forecasts/volatility on the most recent 5-period regime so the OR engine targets (1+L)-period coverage of the new lower mean while keeping safety stock tuned to recent variability. This balances service (avoid stockouts with confirmed LT=4) against holding cost given lower recent demand.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple conclude messages through Period 25); recent sustained demand softening: Periods 21-25 mean \u2248 329 units (353,393,369,232,298).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19 (Period 28). Multiple concluded arrivals establish actual lead time = 4 periods (consistent through Period 27 conclude). On-hand=127, in-transit=1119 \u2014 pipeline looks healthy but recent demand has softened versus early high samples. I set L to the promised/default (4) since concluded history confirms LT=4. I use recent_N (last 5 periods) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent lower-demand regime (reduces overstock risk while meeting service targets).

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple conclude messages through Period 27). Recent sustained demand softening: last 5-period demands (Periods 23-27) = [369,232,298,381,493], mean \u2248 355; use recent regime parameters.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Actual lead time has been repeatedly confirmed as 4 periods in concluded history (multiple arrived=... ordered on Period X, lead_time was 4). Recent demand regime softened; last 5 realized demands (Periods 24-28) = [232, 298, 381, 493, 432] \u2014 use a recent-5 estimate to capture current demand level and volatility. Set L to default (promised lead time = 4). Use mu_hat recent_N N=5 to make the (1+L) forecast reflect the softer recent regime. Use sigma_hat recent_N N=5 so safety stock reflects recent variability. This keeps pipeline targets aligned with confirmed LT=4 and reduces overstock from older high-demand regime while maintaining service against recent demand.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/2 (Period 30). Actual lead time repeatedly confirmed = 4 periods in concluded history. Recent demand regime softened versus early samples; last 5 realized demands (Periods 25-29) = [298,381,493,432,396], mean \u2248 400. On-hand=0 and in-transit=1793; with L=4 the review+lead horizon is 5 periods so pipeline (~1793) is slightly below expected demand over that horizon (~5\xd7400=2000). To reflect the recent lower-demand regime I set demand estimates using the most recent 5-period regime so the OR backend targets a base-stock appropriate to current demand while leaving L as promised (confirmed). Sigma also estimated from the same recent window to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple conclude messages); recent demand regime softened \u2014 last 5-period demands (Periods 25-29) = [298,381,493,432,396], mean \u2248 400.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Recent demand regime has softened vs early history; last 5 observed demands (Periods 25-29) mean \u2248400 units, so use a recent-5 forecast for the (1+L)-period demand. Pipeline (~1743) roughly equals 4.36\xd7recent mean, providing modest coverage. Choices: keep L as promised (default=4), set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture the new lower-mean, moderate-volatility regime and avoid overstocking.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple conclude messages across history). Recent sustained demand softening: last 5-period demands (Periods 25-29) mean \u2248400 units; use recent-regime parameters.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/16 (Period 32). Recent demand regime softened vs earliest high samples; recent 5-period demand average used to reflect current trend and avoid over-ordering. On-hand=0, in-transit=2062 (large pipeline) \u2014 many outstanding units will cover multiple periods; using L = default (promised lead time = 4) because concluded history repeatedly confirms actual lead time = 4. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat from recent_N (N=5) to anchor forecasting on the most recent regime and reduce excess safety stock given high pipeline. This balances service (use recent demand mean) vs holding cost (large in-transit plus softened demand).

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple concluded arrivals); recent sustained demand softening \u2014 use recent-regime parameters (last ~5 periods mean \u2248 400 units).

LLM Rationale:

Demand has softened recently vs early samples; last 5 observed demands (Periods 29-33) = [396,740,708,707,1428] but preceding five (Periods 25-29) mean \u2248400; recent short-term regime average closer to ~400 units. To balance service vs holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1 (q=0.67 \u2192 higher service target) I use a recent-N forecast to capture the softened recent regime while keeping safety stock via the OR backend formula.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07). Multiple conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 4 periods. Recent demand regime softened versus early history; recent variability and a late spike (Period 33) warrant focusing on most recent data. Large pipeline (in-transit=3752) means avoid aggressive new receipts. Set L to promised (default) = 4 to match confirmed lead time; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the current demand regime and recent volatility so the OR engine sizes orders to service short-term demand without overstocking.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). Recent history shows actual lead time = 4 periods consistently (multiple conclude messages). Current inventory: on-hand=125, in-transit=3904 \u2014 ample pipeline but long lead time. Recent demand has been elevated in the last 5 periods (Periods 31-35 demands = [708,707,1428,748,606], mean \u2248 839). To align the OR base-stock calculation with the most recent regime, I set L to the promised/default (4) and use recent_N=5 for demand mean and volatility so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the last 5 observations and adapt quickly if the recent high-demand regime continues. This balances service (avoid stockouts given high recent demand) against holding cost given large pipeline.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/10/21 Period 37. On-hand=361, in-transit=3576. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple period conclusions through Period 36). Recent demand regime: last 5 observed demands (Periods 32-36) = [707,1428,748,606,581] \u2014 elevated and volatile (mean \u2248 814) compared with earlier windows. To respect confirmed LT=4 and capture the most recent demand regime, set L to promised (default) and forecast mu_hat from the most recent 5 periods; keep sigma_hat at default to reflect observed volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L).

To respond to confirmed L=4 and recent elevated demand, set L to default (use promised lead time=4) and base mu/sigma on the most recent 5 periods so the OR backend stocks for the current higher-demand regime while respecting pipeline.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). Historical concludes repeatedly confirm actual lead time = 4 periods and a sustained demand softening vs the early high regime; recent 5-period mean \u2248 400 units (recent-regime). On-hand 1657 + in-transit 1545 = 3202 units, which comfortably covers ~5 periods \xd7 ~400 \u2248 2000 demand\u2014so we can rely on recent demand estimates and not inflate forecasts. Choose L=default (promised 4) consistent with confirmed actual LT; set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the recent 5-period regime to capture the softened mean and recent volatility so the OR base-stock will target appropriate service while avoiding excess holding costs.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). Demand regime has recently firmed compared with the mid-year soft period \u2014 last 5 observed demands (Periods 36-40) = [581,643,663,485,581], mean \u2248 591. On-hand=1565, in-transit=1056 \u2192 ample immediate coverage but pipeline still needed to cover L+1 periods. Actual lead time has been consistently confirmed as 4 periods in concluded history; use promised/default lead time to align with OR backend. Set demand forecast using recent 5-period regime to capture the current uptick and reduce overstock risk from older high-variance samples. Use recent_N for sigma to reflect current volatility. These choices keep base_stock responsive to the recent higher mean while capping orders via the OR engine to limit exposure to holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time confirmed = 4 periods (multiple conclude messages through Period 40). Recent demand regime has firmed in the last 5 periods: Periods 36-40 mean \u2248 591 (581,643,663,485,581).

Actual lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods in concluded history; recent demand regime has firmed (Periods 36-40 mean \u2248591 units). On-hand + pipeline is healthy vs (L+1)-period demand but demand has increased, so set lead time to promised/default (4) and forecast using the recent 5-period regime to capture current elevated mean and volatility. Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=5) gives the OR engine a short-term view that balances service (avoid stockouts as demand rose) against holding cost given large on-hand inventory.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:

Recent demand regime has firmed in Periods 36-40 (mean \u2248591) though Period 42 had a one-off spike (3100) that I treat as an outlier. Use promised/confirmed lead time to align with supplier behavior. Forecast demand using the most recent stable 5-period regime to avoid overreacting to the Period 42 spike. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the current elevated demand and volatility; this will raise the base-stock to protect service given L=4 while capping orders via the OR engine's cap to limit excess holding costs and mitigate risk from in-transit inventory.

LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). On-hand=0, in-transit=3856 (large pipeline). Historical concludes repeatedly confirm actual lead time = 4 periods. Recent demand regime shows a firming in the last 5-period window (Periods 36-40 mean \u2248591); use that recent regime to set demand estimates. Because pipeline is large relative to demand, keep lead time = promised (default) and use recent_N=5 to capture the recent uptick when computing mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend sets a base-stock appropriate to the firmer short-run demand while acknowledging the substantial in-transit buffer.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16 (Period 45). Actual lead time repeatedly confirmed = 4 periods in concluded history. On-hand=0, large in-transit=6478 (orders outstanding from recent periods) \u2014 expect arrivals per confirmed LT=4. Recent demand regime has firmed in the last ~5 periods (Periods 40-44) though Period 42 (demand=3100) is a clear outlier; to balance service vs holding cost I use a recent-window forecast to capture the current elevated demand while limiting overweighting of older high-variance history. Methods chosen: L=default to keep promised/confirmed LT=4; mu_hat=recent_N with N=5 to base the (1+L) forecast on the last 5 demand observations; sigma_hat=recent_N with N=5 to reflect recent volatility including the outlier and enable the OR cap to constrain order sizes.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (Period 46). Historical concludes repeatedly confirm actual lead time = 4 periods; large in-transit balance (6253) from recent mega-orders. Demand recently firmed (Periods 36-40 mean \u2248591) then had a spike in Period 42; to balance responsiveness to recent higher demands while smoothing the spike, use EWMA for mu_hat (moderate gamma). Use promised/confirmed lead time (default) and default volatility estimate so OR backend uses full sample variability. This keeps base-stock responsive but caps ordering via backend cap to avoid over-ordering given already large in-transit.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time confirmed = 4 periods (multiple conclude messages). Large in-transit position present (6253 units) \u2014 monitor but expect arrivals per LT=4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $909.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30. Actual lead time has been consistently confirmed = 4 periods; large in-transit position (5737) and low on-hand (41). Recent demand shows a holiday spike (Period 42 demand=3100) followed by elevated weekly demand (Periods 43-46 = 674,680,657,475). To respect confirmed LT=4 and capture the recent short-term demand spike while letting the large pipeline deplete, use promised LT (default) and a recent-5 demand forecast to reflect holiday-elevated demand. Use default volatility so backend applies long-run variability scaling.
