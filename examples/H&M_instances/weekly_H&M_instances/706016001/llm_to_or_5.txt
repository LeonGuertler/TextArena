Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. On-hand=0, in-transit=0, historical demands = [694,576,685,715,774] (mean \u2248 688.8). No concluded arrivals to infer actual lead time; use promised lead time and full-sample demand stats. Choose L=default to keep promised 4-period lead time. Choose mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level (using full-history mean/variance) against holding cost given modest profit/holding ratio.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 (2019-02-18). Recent demand samples = [694,576,685,715,774], mean=688.8. On-hand=0, in-transit=808 from Period 1 order (ordered=808, arrived=0 in Period 1 conclude) \u2014 this is expected given promised lead time=4 (no concluded arrivals yet). No evidence to change lead-time estimate or demand regime. Use default lead time (promised) and default demand statistics to let the OR engine compute base-stock while pipeline (808) partially covers upcoming (1+L)=5 period demand.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019-02-25). Recent demand samples = [694,576,685,715,774] (mean ~688). On-hand=0, in-transit=1601 (equals orders 808+793); no concluded arrivals yet and promised lead time=4 so no evidence to change lead-time. Use default lead time to let OR use promised L=4. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample set. This keeps parameters grounded in full historical demand while the outstanding pipeline is expected to cover upcoming periods; watch for missing concludes in future to detect lost shipments.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/4. Recent observed demands (historical samples) average ~688.8 units; current on-hand=0, in-transit=2383 (~3.46 periods of demand) which is below the target pipeline of (1+L)=5 periods. No concluded arrivals yet (orders placed earlier remain in-transit), so use promised lead time to avoid misinference. Choose default lead time to keep to contract (L=4). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing a conservative replenishment target that replenishes the missing ~1.5 periods of coverage while balancing profit vs holding cost.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). On-hand=0, in-transit=3173. Historical demand samples [694,576,685,715,774] mean=688.8, std\u224871.95. No concluded arrivals observed (Periods 1-4 arrivals=0) so cannot infer actual lead time; use promised lead time. Use default statistical aggregation: L=promised (default) and mu_hat/sigma_hat computed from full sample \xd7 (1+L) and sqrt(1+L) respectively to let OR backend set base-stock balancing profit ($2) vs holding ($1). This keeps policy conservative given large pipeline but unknown arrival reliability.

Carry-over insight: No concluded arrivals for orders placed in Periods 1-4 (arrived=0 each period) \u2014 indicates shipments delayed or lost; treat as potential supply reliability issue until arrivals conclude.

Daily Reward (R_t): $596.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). Recent demand has declined from ~700s to ~400-500s (periods 3-5: 539, 447, 468), so I detect a downward demand regime beginning ~Period 3. On-hand=340 + in-transit=2498 provides substantial cover vs expected demand; one concluded arrival shows actual lead_time=4 (order from Period 1 arrived in Period 5). Because observed lead times match the promised 4 in concluded data, set L via calculated average of observed lead times. For demand forecast use recent 3-period mean to capture the new lower regime: mu_hat method recent_N with N=3 (covers review+lead (1+L) periods). Use sigma_hat recent_N with N=3 to reflect recent volatility. This reduces overstating demand vs historical highs while the large pipeline limits urgent ordering, helping balance service level and holding cost given supply delays.

Carry-over insight: No concluded arrivals for orders placed in Periods 2-4 until Period 5 arrival for Period 1 order; treat as potential supply reliability issue until further concludes confirm consistent lead times.

Daily Reward (R_t): $373.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/25. Recent realized arrivals: Period 5 (order from P1) and Period 6 (order from P2) both show lead_time=4 \u2192 recent observed lead time = 4. Current inventory: on-hand=631, in-transit=1705 (large pipeline). Recent demand has moderated (~470\u2013502 in last three periods) vs older higher historical samples; to be responsive to the recent lower-demand regime while accounting for the 4-period lead time and substantial pipeline, use recent-demand statistics. Choose L by averaging observed lead times to reflect supplier reality. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets (1+L)\xd7recent mean and recent volatility, reducing overstock risk given heavy pipeline and ongoing holding cost. These settings balance service (respecting 4-period supply delay) against holding cost by shrinking target stock to recent demand levels while letting the OR cap limit order sizes against pipeline.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/1 (Period 8). Recent demand samples show high weekly demand (samples mean \u2248 688.8 from [694,576,685,715,774]). Observed concluded arrivals indicate a stable actual lead time of 4 periods (Period1\u2192arrived in P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7). On-hand (902) + in-transit (1303) = 2205 units; required coverage for (1+L)=5 periods \u2248 5\xd7688.8=3444 units, so pipeline + on-hand currently short of target \u2014 backend default base-stock calculation will upscale orders accordingly. I choose to let the OR engine use the calculated lead time from observed concludes (L='calculate') and default mu/sigma (backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so it uses all historical demand to produce a robust base stock while reflecting confirmed L=4.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time confirmed at 4 periods based on concluded arrivals: Period1\u2192arrived in P5 (lead_time=4); Period2\u2192P6 (4); Period3\u2192P7 (4). Prior multi-period non-arrivals resolved; monitor for future lost shipments.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). Recent concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=4 for orders placed in Periods 1-4 (P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7, P4\u2192P8). On-hand=1132, in-transit=1298; pipeline + on-hand comfortably covers multiple periods of demand. Given confirmed 4-period actual lead time, set L via observed lead times, and use default mu_hat/sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR backend computes base-stock from full sample statistics. This balances service (use confirmed L) versus holding cost (profit/holding implies moderate q). Monitoring continues for lost shipments but current evidence supports stable L=4.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time confirmed at 4 periods (evidence: P1\u2192arrived in P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7, P4\u2192P8); prior multi-period non-arrivals resolved\u2014treat supply as stable at L=4 until future concludes contradict.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). Recent concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 (P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7, P4\u2192P8, P5\u2192P9) so supply appears stable at promised L=4. Current on-hand=930, in-transit=1843 \u2192 ample pipeline relative to typical weekly demand; no immediate emergency ordering. Use default statistical aggregation so OR backend uses full sample history to compute base_stock and cap given L=4. This balances service (use confirmed L) versus holding cost given high on-hand+pipeline and stable lead-time.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). Historical demand samples = [694,576,685,715,774] (mean \u2248 689). Previously observed concluded arrivals confirm stable actual lead time = 4 periods. Current inventory: on-hand=661, in-transit=2101 \u2192 pipeline_inventory=2762, which is below the (1+L)\xd7mean demand (\u22483445), so replenishment needed. I choose L=default to use the promised/stable lead time (4), mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR engine computes base_stock and cap from full-sample stats; this leverages the confirmed L=4 and historical demand stability while letting the backend size the order to cover the (L+1)-period demand vs. holding cost tradeoff.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=780, in-transit=1905; pipeline plus on-hand covers multiple future periods. Use default lead time to match confirmed supply behavior. Use default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and default volatility (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR backend computes base-stock and cap from full historical demand, balancing the $2 profit vs $1 holding cost while avoiding overreacting to short-term demand noise or prior transient delays.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=1226 and in-transit=1300 provide ample cover vs historical weekly demand (samples mean ~ 688), but holding cost ($1) vs profit ($2) requires avoiding excessive overstock. Use default statistics so the OR engine computes base_stock from full-sample mean/variance and the promised lead time, which matches observed stable L and keeps conservative safety stock given moderate demand variability. No evidence of a new changepoint requiring EWMA or recent_N adjustments.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:

Recent supply disruptions resolved and supply appears stable at L=4. Use default lead time (promised L=4) to match observed stability. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the full sample set, keeping the base-stock anchored to empirical demand while the backend\u2019s cap limits exposure to lost shipments.

On-hand=1541 + in-transit=746 provides ample coverage vs. historical weekly demand; no outstanding lost shipments to penalize. Use default lead time (promised L=4) and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes base_stock from full-sample mean/variance \u2014 this is conservative given stable L and ample inventory and balances service level (profit $2 vs holding $1) with holding cost risk.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). Recent conclude history shows consistent actual lead time = 4 (orders from P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7, P4\u2192P8, and continued confirms through P16). On-hand=1188, in-transit=908 provides ample coverage vs recent weekly demands (historical sample list used by backend). Given stable L=4 evidence, use default lead time and default demand estimates so OR backend applies full-sample mean/variance over (1+L) periods. This avoids overfitting short-term noise and leverages proven 4-period supply reliability; it balances service (through base-stock) vs holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

Carry-over insight: Supply lead time stabilized at L=4 periods based on concluded arrivals across multiple orders (P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7, P4\u2192P8 and subsequent concludes through P16); treat L=4 as current regime until future concludes contradict.

Demand history samples: [694,576,685,715,774] (mean ~689). On-hand=1019, in-transit=1165 \u2014 pipeline + on-hand > short-term demand so no emergency inflow needed. Given stable evidence for L=4, use promised/default lead time to align with observed regime. Use default demand aggregation and volatility (backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples) to keep orders conservative and let OR engine balance service vs holding cost; this avoids overreacting to earlier transient non-arrivals while covering (L+1) periods of demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-135.00

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22). Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (stable since Period 8+); demand samples (seed) = [694,576,685,715,774]. On-hand=873, in-transit=1257 -> pipeline=2130 which provides substantial coverage for (1+L) periods. Use promised/default lead time to match observed stable regime and let OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility from full sample set; this balances service level (profit>holding) while avoiding manual over-ordering given abundant pipeline.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/29 (Period 25). Demand history shows mean \u2248688.8 (samples [694,576,685,715,774]) and concluded lead time has been stable at 4 periods across many orders. On-hand=970 + in-transit=1277 = 2247 units, while (1+L)*mean \u2248 5*688.8 = 3444 units \u2192 pipeline+on-hand currently below the target coverage for (L+1) periods, so we should use the standard default estimators and let the OR engine generate orders to replenish. Given stable concluded lead time=4 and no new regime signals, use promised/default lead time and default demand statistics to avoid overfitting to short-term noise and to let the capped ordering rule manage rate-of-arrival risk.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Recent concluded history shows a stable actual lead time of 4 periods and demand centering near ~689 units (historical sample mean=688.8). On-hand=896 + in-transit=1248 => pipeline=2144 units, which comfortably covers multiple periods of expected demand. Given confirmed L=4, no strong recent demand regime change, and symmetric historical variability, use default statistical estimates so the OR engine applies its base-stock calculation with full-sample mean/std. This balances service (profit $2 vs holding $1 favors higher fill) against holding cost while relying on the backend's capped order logic to limit single-period order spikes.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). Recent concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods across many orders, supply appears stable. On-hand=843 and in-transit=1191 provide substantial coverage vs recent weekly demands (history shows weekly demands mostly 200-560 after initial high values). Use promised lead time (default L=4) because concluded history supports it; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from available demand samples. This balances service level (protect against stockouts with L+1 coverage) while avoiding excess holding given holding cost=$1 and profit=$2.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Recent concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 (multiple orders P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6 ... through P27 conclusions), so treat supply as stable at L=4. Historical demand samples (seed) = [694,576,685,715,774] -> mean ~688.8. On-hand=726 + in-transit=1182 = 1908 units, which is below (1+L)-period expected demand (5-period demand \u22483444), so the OR system should target full coverage of the 5-period demand while balancing profit vs holding cost. Use promised/default lead time and default demand/volatility estimates so backend computes base_stock and cap using full sample statistics and the stable L=4 regime.

Concluded arrivals consistently indicate actual lead time = 4 periods across many orders (stabilized since Period 17). On-hand=0, in-transit=2032 (pipeline sizeable).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). Demand has been strong recently with stockouts in Periods 30-32 (sold out each period); on-hand=0, in-transit=1978. Concluded arrivals historically show a stable actual lead time of 4 periods across many orders, so treat supply regime as L=4. Because sample demand seed provided (mean \u2248689) and no clear recent demand regime change beyond high recent pulls, use default forecasting so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This lets the OR engine target the base-stock reflecting 5-period coverage while accounting for variability; note current pipeline (1978) is below implied 5-period demand (~3445) so pipeline shortfall may persist until arrivals complete.

Recent demand spike in Period 33 (1428) increases uncertainty but is a single extreme; no persistent regime change detected in demand mean/variance. Choose default methods so OR backend uses full-sample stats with L=promised to compute base-stock and capped order. This preserves service (handles observed lead time) while letting the OR cap limit excessive orders and control holding cost given current large pipeline.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07). Demand context: recent concluded history shows consistent actual lead time = 4 periods (concludes across many orders); on-hand=0, in-transit=2309. Past sample seed demands = [694,576,685,715,774]. Several early missing arrivals resolved and supply has been stable at L=4 since Period 8\u201317 onward. Given stable lead-time evidence and sufficient pipeline (2309 units) I use default statistics so OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This keeps parameters aligned with confirmed L=4 regime and lets the OR engine cap orders while accounting for observed demand variability; conservative default avoids overreacting to transient noise while relying on confirmed lead-time stability.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 (multiple orders P1\u2192P5 ... through P31\u2192P35), so treat supply as stable at L=4. Recent demand has increased and become more volatile (last 5 period demands: 708, 707, 1428, 748, 606) so use a recent-window estimate to capture current regime. Set L explicitly to 4 to reflect observed stable lead time; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to adapt to elevated mean and volatility and thus balance service level vs holding cost given large in-transit volume (2007) and on-hand=115.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=0, in-transit=2951. Historical conclues consistently confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple orders from P1\u2192P5 through later periods), and prior delayed arrivals have since resolved into a stable L=4 regime. Given stable L=4, use default demand aggregation so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This is conservative and leverages full sample history while the large in-transit pipeline reduces immediate urgency to inflate forecasts; keeping defaults avoids overreacting to recent volatility and balances service level vs. holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=0, in-transit=2418. Historical concludes show consistent actual lead time L=4 across many orders; supply appears stable. Recent demand history shows elevated mean and volatility but no clear new regime requiring ad-hoc adjustment. Using default methods keeps OR backend anchored to full-sample demand statistics and promised lead time (L=4) so orders cover (1+L) periods of demand while the capped order limits excessive inventory given holding cost. This also acknowledges prior delayed-arrival events are resolved (stable L=4).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). Demand history (seed) mean=688.8, recent pattern and conclues show stable actual lead time L=4 across many periods. Current inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=2149 \u2014 covers ~3.1 periods at historical mean but below (1+L)=5 period coverage, so we should top up. Choose L=default to use promised/stable lead time=4. Choose mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default to let OR backend compute (1+L)-period mean and volatility from full sample set, keeping forecasts stable and leveraging long-run demand stats while the pipeline rebuilds. This balances service level (avoid stockouts given long lead time) against holding cost by using backend's capped ordering rule.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019/11/11). On-hand=0, in-transit=2358. Concluded history shows consistent actual lead time = 4 periods across many orders (stable regime). Demand samples seed provided; to be conservative and leverage full sample statistics while honoring promised lead time, use default lead time and default demand moments so OR backend computes base-stock from all samples. Large in-transit position plus L=4 implies current pipeline already covers multiple periods; default stats balance service vs holding given profit $2 and holding $1.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:

Date=2019-11-18 (Period 41). Historic concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple orders P1\u2192P5 ... through P36\u2192P40); earlier delayed arrivals resolved and supply appears stable at L=4. On-hand=807 + in-transit=1383 provides strong coverage vs recent demand; to avoid overreacting to past transient delays I use the promised/default lead time and default demand estimators so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history. This balances service (use observed L=4 via default) against holding cost given high on-hand and pipeline, letting the backend cap replenishment to avoid excessive ending inventory while preserving service level.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). Demand context: historical seed samples = [694,576,685,715,774]; recent concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (stable regime since Period 17). Current inventory: on-hand=260, in-transit=1969 \u2014 healthy pipeline. No new changepoint in demand or lead time detected. Use promised/default L so OR uses established L=4; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting the capped base-stock logic balance service vs holding cost given stable supply and ample pipeline.

Period 43 (2019/12/02). On-hand=0, in-transit=2176. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods across many orders, so treat supply regime as stable at L=4 and use promised/default lead time. Maintain backend's default demand estimates (use all historical samples) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect long-run mean/volatility; current pipeline (2176) provides multi-period coverage but will be evaluated by OR engine against computed base stock. This choice is conservative given recent large demand spikes (e.g. Period 42 demand=3100) and preserves service while letting the OR backend cap orders to control holding cost.

Historical sample mean demand \u2248689/unit/period (historical seed). With promised L=4 the target review+lead window is 5 periods; required stock \u22485\xd7mean\u22483445 units, so pipeline (2858) is below that target and risk of stockouts remains. Use default lead-time and demand estimators to let the OR backend compute base-stock from the long-run sample mean/variance while keeping the policy conservative given confirmed L=4 and the current pipeline shortfall.
