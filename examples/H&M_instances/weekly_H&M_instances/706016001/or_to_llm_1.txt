Current system pipeline = 3445 units (sum of outstanding orders) which matches the two prior orders (808 + 2637), so treat 3445 as available in-transit but not yet on-hand. Demand outlook: historical single-period mean \u2248 689 units (samples [694,576,685,715,774], mean=688.8). With that mean, the in-transit pipeline covers ~5.0 periods of expected demand (3445/689 \u2248 5.0). Cost tradeoffs: profit = $2/unit, holding = $1/unit/period; extra units ordered now risk incurring holding cost before sell-through and reduce objective. OR recommended 33 units (uses promised L=4 and past data) but ignores the large existing pipeline and potential excess holding. Decision: place 0 order. Rationale: do not add inventory while substantial pipeline (\u22483445) already covers multiple periods of expected demand and holding cost is significant; monitor future conclude messages for actual arrival confirmations or lost shipments, then revise orders if pipeline shortfalls appear.

Over (L+1)=5 periods expected demand \u03bc\u0302 = 5\xd7689 = 3445, which exactly matches current pipeline_inventory. 3) OR recommendation: OR=0 is consistent with pipeline already covering the 5-period base-stock target. 4) Risk adjustment: Because no shipments have concluded after multiple periods, there is non-trivial risk of lost/delayed supply. To hedge modestly against a lost shipment while avoiding large holding costs (holding=$1/unit/period), place a small top-up order rather than follow OR=0 exactly. 5) Decision: order 100 units \u2014 small enough to limit holding cost if pipeline arrives, but provides some protection if part of the in-transit 3445 is lost.
