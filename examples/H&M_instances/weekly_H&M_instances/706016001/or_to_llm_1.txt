Decision: follow OR recommendation of 808 units. Reasoning: with zero on-hand and zero pipeline, we cannot avoid a multi-period stockout until an order placed now arrives (lead time 4). Ordering more than OR's capped quantity increases holding cost if arrivals eventually bunch or exposes us to lost-order risk without improving service within the next 4 periods. OR's cap balances single-period demand and service variability; given no calendar/seasonal signal and stable historical demand, the capped OR quantity is a prudent trade-off between stocking to serve future demand and minimizing holding costs and overcommitment to potentially lost shipments.",

Given product is staple denim with no calendar spike indicated and profit/holding costs imply moderate safety stock (critical fractile q=2/(2+1)=0.6667 \u2192 z\u22480.43), I want to restore pipeline to cover the full (L+1) demand to avoid likely stockouts when in-transit orders arrive unpredictably.
