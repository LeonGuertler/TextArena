Reality check: recent realized weekly demands (Periods 13\u201317: 241,189,375,533,451) show a materially lower and more variable short-run mean than the long-run sample used by OR, suggesting demand has softened from the earlier high baseline.

Demand analysis: historical base (provided samples) implies single-period mean \u2248689 with sd \u224872, but recent sustained regime shift (Periods 30\u201333 and onward) shows much higher demand \u2014 carry-over insight already records avg \u2248916 after Period 30; Period 42 also produced an extreme spike (3100) suggesting strong holiday/seasonal uplift around late Nov. OR recommendation: 933 units (base-stock capped policy using promised L=0). Decision: place 1000 units. Rationale for adjustment: I modestly increase OR's 933 to 1000 (+7%) to (1) cover the higher recent regime mean \u2248900\u2013920, (2) provide a small safety buffer for holiday uplift and the recent extreme spike, and (3) accept modest holding cost ($1) relative to profit ($4) to avoid costly stockouts.
