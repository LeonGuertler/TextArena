Inventory & pipeline: on-hand = 3, in-transit = 2654 (total available soon = 2657). With lead_time=4, an order placed now would not arrive until Period 50; we must cover current period demand plus 4 future periods. Forecast & decision logic: conservative short-term forecast ~650/week (with potential + for 1\u20132 weeks), so 5-period demand \u2248 3,250 units. Current pipeline (2,657) is below that theoretical 5-period sum, but pipeline already represents multiple scheduled shipments and cancelling or ordering more incurs holding cost = $1/unit/period vs profit = $2/unit sold. Given very large existing in-transit, uncertain exact arrival timing of each tranche but consistent 4-period lead time historically, and high holding cost, avoid risking excessive overstock. Also supplier lead time means any order now arrives after the critical Christmas window. Therefore do not place additional order this period.",
