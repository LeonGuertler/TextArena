Historical recent regime: elevated fall demand (Periods 30\u201336) then mixed; no new sustained shift in last 3 periods beyond the modest drop in P46. Lead time & pipeline: past conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 0 (orders arrive same period). On-hand = 225, in-transit = 0, so any order placed now will arrive before demand. Inventory logic & economics: profit = $4/unit sold, holding = $1/unit/period. Cost of understock (lost profit $4) > cost of one-period overstock ($1), so target to cover expected demand for the upcoming period. Forecast \u2248 600; required order = max(0, forecast \u2212 on-hand) = 600 \u2212 225 = 375. Final action: order 375 units to meet expected period demand while avoiding excessive end-of-period holding.",
