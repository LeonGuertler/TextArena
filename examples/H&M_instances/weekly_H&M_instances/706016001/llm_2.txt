Period 47 (2019/12/30) VM Action:
============================================================
{
  "rationale": "World + product: Jeans (evergreen) around 2019-12-30 \u2014 modest post-holiday demand; no strong seasonality besides year-end. Recent demand regime: last 6 realized demands = [680,657,475,700,674,3100] but excluding the one extreme spike (P42=3100), recent typical weekly demand \u2248 500\u2013700 (historical seed mean \u2248688). Lead time & arrivals: supplier lead_time remains variable (evidence in history shows 1\u20133 periods); treat worst-case LT=3 for safety. Inventory & pipeline: on-hand=225, in-transit=1590 => total available =1815. Requirement: cover (max_LT + 1)=4 future periods of demand \u22484\xd7600=2400 units \u2192 short \u2248585 units. Cost tradeoff: profit=$2/unit vs holding=$1/unit/period; avoid large overstock given holding cost. Final ordering logic: place a conservative replenishment to cover the expected shortfall (~585), rounded to a practical order size 600 units to protect against up-to-3 period delays while limiting holding cost exposure.",
