  "rationale": "World/calendar: Period date 2019-12-30 (post-Christmas). Recent peak around Black Friday (Period 42 demand=3100) has passed; demand has fallen toward typical weekly levels. Demand analysis: recent demands P42\u2013P46 = [3100, 674, 680, 657, 475]; excluding the one-off spike, the running weekly demand is ~600\u2013700. Historical prior sample mean ~690. Inventory & pipeline: on-hand=105, in-transit=1382 \u2192 total supply available \u22481487 units, which covers ~2\u20132.5 weeks at ~600/week. Lead time: recent concluded messages show variable actual lead times (1\u20133 historically); no new sustained shift confirmed. Risk/decision: promised lead time=2 but variability exists; given large in-transit stock and high holding cost ($1/unit/period) vs profit $4/unit, avoid extra ordering to reduce holding cost and risk of lost/late arrivals. Action: do not order this period.",
