Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019-02-11). Past demands = [694,576,685,715,774] -> mean \u2248 688.8. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 and no concluded arrivals yet, so no evidence of lead-time deviation or lost shipments. Profit/Holding = $2/$1 \u2192 q=0.667, so backend should target a relatively high service level. I choose default lead time (use promised L=4) and default demand estimates so the OR engine uses the full-sample mean/SD across the (1+L) review+lead horizon; this is conservative given zero on-hand and aims to balance service vs. holding cost.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/2/18 (Period 2). On-hand=0, in-transit=808 (ordered Period 1) but Period 1 conclude shows arrived=0 \u2014 consistent with promised lead time \u22651; no concluded arrivals yet so actual lead time cannot be inferred. Use promised lead time (default) to avoid prematurely assuming lost shipment. Demand history mean ~688.8 (samples [694,576,685,715,774]); using default mu_hat and sigma_hat yields (1+L) scaling of historical mean and std to balance service level vs holding cost given profit=$2 vs holding=$1. This keeps the OR engine's base-stock anchoring on full-sample statistics until arrivals/lead-time behavior can be observed.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). On-hand=0, in-transit=1601. Two prior orders (P1=808, P2=793) remain unarrived in concluded messages \u2014 no concluded arrivals observed, so no reliable evidence to change promised lead time yet. Demand history samples = [694,576,685,715,774] (mean ~688.8). To avoid overfitting to short-term noise and because we lack concluded arrival data to infer a different lead-time regime, use default lead time (promised) and default demand moments so the OR backend applies its standard (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std calculations. This balances service (covering L+1 periods) against holding cost while we wait for arrival confirmations; if shipments remain missing in future concludes, revise L explicitly.

Carry-over insight: Pending shipments: orders placed in Periods 1 and 2 (808, 793) have not concluded; possible shipment delays or losses \u2014 monitor future conclude messages for confirmation.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (2019-03-04). On-hand=0, in-transit=2383 (sum of orders from Periods 1-3); no 'arrived=' conclude messages yet so actual lead time cannot be inferred \u2014 shipments are pending but not confirmed lost. Historical demand samples available (706016001): [694,576,685,715,774]; recent observed demands in concluded periods: 671, 673, 539. I use default lead time (promised L) because only concluded arrivals permit lead-time inference. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from the full sample set, giving a stable baseline forecast and volatility for the backend to compute base stock; this avoids overreacting to the short recent dip (539) while keeping the pipeline coverage target (L+1 periods). Monitoring: if conclude messages continue to show zero arrivals beyond promised lead time, switch to explicit/recent_N for L in a future period.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). On-hand=0, in-transit=3173 (sum of orders from Periods 1-4). All historical conclude messages show no arrivals yet; no concluded arrivals to compute an empirical lead time or detect a finalized lost-shipment pattern. Demand history samples = [694,576,685,715,774] (mean\u2248688.8). Because we lack any concluded arrivals, I retain the promised lead time and use default demand estimates so the OR backend uses its standard (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std calculations. This keeps orders conservative while the shipment status resolves\u2014avoids overreacting to potentially-delayed but not-yet-lost in-transit inventory.

Carry-over insight: Pending shipments: orders placed in Periods 1-4 (808, 793, 782, 790 = 3173 units) have not concluded; monitor future conclude messages for confirmation of delays or lost shipments.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent conclude shows Period 1 order (808) arrived with lead_time=4, confirming promised L=4. Multiple subsequent orders (Periods 2-5 totaling 2498) remain in-transit \u2014 possible delays but not yet lost. Use default lead time to keep OR engine aligned with promised L and confirmed arrival. Demand history (samples [694,576,685,715,774]) shows stable mean; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample set. This conservative choice balances service level (covering L+1 periods) against holding cost while monitoring in-transit non-conclusions for future updates.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (Period 1 order arrived in Period 5; evidence: 'arrived=808 units (ordered on Period 1, lead_time was 4 periods)').

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). On-hand=631, in-transit=2095. Historical demands = [694,576,685,715,774] (mean=688.8). Concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 4 periods (Period1\u2192arrived in Period5; Period2\u2192arrived in Period6). Use calculated L to reflect observed lead-time regime; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample, preserving demand signal and letting OR engine set base-stock consistent with profit/holding tradeoff.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (evidence: 'arrived=808 units (ordered on Period 1, lead_time was 4 periods)' in Period 5 conclude; 'arrived=793 units (ordered on Period 2, lead_time was 4 periods)' in Period 6 conclude).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). Recent concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (orders from Periods 1-3 concluded with W=4). Current inventory: on-hand=902, in-transit=1760 \u2014 ample pipeline but several past orders were delayed then arrived, so continue using observed lead time. Demand has shifted down from earlier high values to a lower, stable regime in the most recent 5 periods (demands ~539,447,468,502,511), so I use a recent-window forecast to capture the lower mean and variance. Choices: L set by calculate to use observed lead times; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=5 to target the (1+L)-period demand mean and volatility from the most recent regime, balancing service level vs holding cost given ample pipeline.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/8 (Period 9). On-hand=1132, in-transit=970. Concluded arrivals in Periods 5\u20138 show orders placed in Periods 1\u20134 each arrived with lead_time=4 (evidence: 'arrived=808 units (ordered on Period 1, lead_time was 4)' in Period 5 conclude and analogous messages in Periods 6\u20138). Therefore set L to the calculated average observed lead time (4). Use default demand aggregation methods so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all historical samples, letting it produce the base-stock and cap while respecting the inferred 4-period actual lead time and current pipeline.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15 (Period 10). Recent conclude messages consistently show orders placed in Periods 1-5 arriving with lead_time=4; actual lead time matches promised L=4. On-hand=930, in-transit=1613 (pending arrivals from recent orders). No evidence of lost shipments since multiple concludes confirmed arrivals with 4-period lead time. Use default methods so backend uses promised L and full-sample demand stats: this keeps base-stock anchored to historical mean (protecting service given long lead time) while the backend's cap limits excessive orders to control holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). On-hand=1051, in-transit=1711. Historical concluded arrivals show a consistent actual lead time of 4 periods (orders from Periods 1-4 arrived in Periods 5-8 with lead_time=4). No evidence of lost shipments after those confirms. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses observed lead times (reflecting confirmed L=4). I choose default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing a stable base-stock that balances service level (profit-driven q) versus holding cost given ample on-hand+pipeline stock.

Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). On-hand=1237, in-transit=1448. Historical demand samples = [694,576,685,715,774] (mean\u2248688.8). Concluded arrivals show consistent actual lead time = 4 periods (arrivals for orders placed in Periods 1\u20134 arrived with lead_time=4), so promised lead time is validated. Use default lead time so backend uses promised L=4. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample set \u2014 this leverages the stable demand history and the confirmed lead time while avoiding overreaction to transient order-placement noise. This keeps base-stock appropriate given high on-hand + in-transit and balances service level vs holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time confirmed = 4 periods (evidence: arrived units from orders placed in Periods 1\u20134 each reported lead_time=4 in Periods 5\u20138 conclude messages).

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=898, in-transit=1628. Historical conclues consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple 'arrived=... lead_time was 4' messages in Periods 5\u201311); one recent conclude (Period 12) shows arrived=0 for an order but overall lead-time regime remains 4. Pipeline+on-hand=2526 vs. (1+L)*mean demand=3444 \u2192 current stock+pipeline is short of the 5-period demand forecast, so keep forecast horizon = 4. Set L by 'calculate' to lock to observed lead time average; use 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend uses all historical samples ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to produce a stable base-stock that balances $2 profit vs $1 holding cost and accounts for observed variability and occasional missed arrivals.

Historical conclude messages consistently show arrived lead_time=4 for multiple orders (Periods 5\u201311 confirms orders placed in Periods 1\u20137 with W=4), so actual lead time aligns with promised L=4. No recent changepoint in demand; use backend defaults so OR uses full sample mean/variance scaled by (1+L). Choosing default for L, mu_hat, sigma_hat balances service level (maintain coverage for L+1 periods) while avoiding manual overcorrection given large on-hand + in-transit.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=1732, in-transit=816; no new lost-shipment signal. I use the promised/default lead time to reflect confirmed L=4 and keep alignment with OR engine. Demand sample set (provided) shows mean ~688.8; use default mu_hat and default sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This keeps forecasting stable given clear 4-period lead time and avoids overreacting to short-term fluctuations while the pipeline appears healthy.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). Recent history shows stable demand (past samples [694,576,685,715,774]) and confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods across multiple concluded arrivals. On-hand=1541 + in-transit=746 gives ample coverage vs recent weekly demand (~treat samples as weekly). No new sustained changepoint in demand or lead time; one anomalous zero arrival (Period 12) did not persist. Use promised/default lead time so OR backend uses L=4. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level (profit=2 vs holding=1) without overreacting to a transient missing arrival.

Concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4 periods (orders from Periods 1\u201311 that concluded report W=4), so set L based on observed lead times. Use backend defaults for demand moments so it computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, providing a stable base-stock given confirmed L=4 and the available pipeline. This balances service (use observed L) versus holding cost (defaults use full-sample stats rather than overreacting to recent noise).

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10 (Period 18). Demand history shows stable weekly demands with mean elevated vs. initial seed; actual lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded messages (Period 5\u201317 arrivals all indicate lead_time=4). Several early periods showed pending shipments but later conclues confirmed on-time 4-period arrivals, so no evidence of persistent lost shipments now. I select default lead time to match the confirmed actual (promised=4). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I choose default (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all samples) to leverage the full historical demand sample set, keeping forecasting conservative and allowing the OR engine to compute the base-stock balancing profit vs. holding cost. This approach hedges against stockouts while avoiding manual over-adjustment given consistent lead-time confirmation.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-22 (Period 24). Demand has been stable with confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods in past concludes; on-hand=873 + in-transit=1257 gives 2130 units in pipeline which is ample versus recent weekly demand (~300\u2013500). Use default lead time (promised 4) since concludes consistently show 4. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level vs holding cost given stable demand and substantial pipeline; monitor for any lost shipments or lead-time drift.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Recent demand run-rate ~300\u2013560/week with ending on-hand=970 and in-transit=1277. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (orders placed in Periods 1\u201320 that concluded all report lead_time=4). No evidence of lost shipments in recent windows. Use inferred lead time = 4 to size (1+L)-period demand. Select default demand/volatility estimators so backend uses full-sample mean/std scaled by (1+L) to produce a base-stock that balances $2 profit vs $1 holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained actual lead time = 4 periods (evidence: conclude messages showing arrived units from orders placed in Periods 1\u201320 each with lead_time=4).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/5 (Period 26). History of conclude messages consistently shows actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple arrived=... lead_time was 4 periods from Periods 5\u201325), so set L by averaging observed lead times. On-hand=896 and in-transit=1248; pipeline is healthy but we keep standard demand/statistics to let OR backend balance service vs holding cost. Chosen methods: L='calculate' (uses observed lead times avg=4), mu_hat='default' ((1+L)\xd7mean of all demand samples) to use full-sample demand estimate, sigma_hat='default' (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) for volatility. This leverages confirmed lead-time evidence and lets OR engine compute base-stock and cap while accounting for holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=843, in-transit=1191. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods. Demand context: steady weekly demand ~300\u2013500 in recent periods with earlier samples provided. To keep parameters aligned with promised/confirmed lead time and full-sample demand statistics, use default lead time and full-sample mu/sigma so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std respectively. This balances service (use confirmed L=4) vs holding cost by relying on base-stock computed from full historical demand.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19 (Period 28). Historical conclude messages consistently confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (sustained through Period 25). On-hand=726 + in-transit=1182 = 1908 units, which provides coverage vs. expected demand over the (L+1) review+lead horizon. Given clear, sustained lead-time=4 and stable historical demand, use the backend defaults so it computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this keeps forecasting anchored to full-history statistics while the OR engine computes the optimal base-stock balancing profit ($2) vs holding cost ($1).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Demand history samples = [694,576,685,715,774]; recent observed arrivals confirm stable actual lead time = 4 periods and regular weekly demand around mean ~688. On-hand=643, in-transit=1331 \u2014 pipeline + on-hand provides strong coverage vs (L+1)-period demand. Use promised/default lead time to match confirmed reality and keep OR engine's statistical calculations aligned with full-sample demand moments. Default mu_hat and sigma_hat let the OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level (via profit/holding tradeoff) while avoiding overfitting to short-term noise.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). Demand history shows steady weekly demand with seed samples [694,576,685,715,774]; concluded arrivals consistently indicate actual lead time = 4 periods. Current on-hand=442, in-transit=1563 (pipeline large). Given confirmed 4-period lead time and no recent regime shift in demand, use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples. This leverages the long-run demand stats while the large pipeline reduces immediate stockout risk; defaults balance service level vs. holding cost without overreacting to minor noise.

Pipeline (1678) matches recent arrivals pattern; no new evidence of lost shipments. Use observed lead time inference and default demand aggregation to let OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over history so base-stock and cap reflect confirmed L=4 and prevailing demand variability.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 32 (2019-09-16). Recent demand has been volatile with two large weeks (740, 708) that depleted on-hand to 0; on-hand=0, in-transit=2032. Historical conclude messages consistently confirm actual lead time = 4 periods. Given confirmed LT=4 and the supplied historical demand samples, use defaults so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and scaled std across all samples. This leverages the proven lead-time regime and lets the optimizer set base-stock while avoiding manual misspecification; monitor incoming conclude messages for any lost shipments or regime shifts.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). Demand context: recent weekly demands have been high (many weeks near 400\u2013740); past seed samples show mean demand ~ (694+576+685+715+774)/5 = ~688. Actual lead time has been consistently 4 periods (confirmed through multiple conclude messages). On-hand=0, in-transit=1978 \u2014 pipeline covers roughly 4+1 periods of expected demand (using default forecast). Given confirmed LT=4 and stable demand regime, use default L and default demand statistics so the OR backend computes base_stock and cap from full-sample mean/SD. This balances service (maintain coverage over L+1 periods) while avoiding manual over-adjustment for volatility or transient spikes.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-30 (Period 34). On-hand=0, in-transit=2084. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple conclude messages from Periods 5\u201333 confirming orders placed arrive after 4 periods). No evidence of lost shipments recently; pipeline large but on-hand depleted by recent demand spikes (e.g. Period 33 demand=1428). I therefore use the promised lead time (default L=4) which matches observed regime. For demand forecasting I use default aggregation ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) because the provided historical sample set [694,576,685,715,774] is recent and stable with no detected mean shift warranting a shorter window or EWMA. Volatility also uses default (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to let the OR backend compute safety stock consistent with profit/holding tradeoff. These choices keep the backend's base-stock and cap calculations aligned with the confirmed 4-period lead time and stable historical demand while avoiding overfitting to recent high-demand spikes.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-07 (Period 35). Demand history shows high weekly demand with prior confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (consistent arrivals in conclude messages). Current inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=2309 \u2014 pipeline present but no on-hand. Given strong evidence that actual lead time = promised 4 and no new changepoint in demand, use default statistical aggregation so OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean of the provided samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This keeps L tied to promised lead time, relies on the full-sample mean/variance to balance service level vs. holding cost, and avoids overreacting to short-term arrival variability while acknowledging past delayed/returned shipments via conservative default L.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). On-hand=115, in-transit=2007. Historical conclude messages consistently show arrived units from orders placed 4 periods earlier \u2014 sustained actual lead time = 4. Several earlier periods showed temporary pending shipments but subsequent concludes confirmed arrivals with lead_time=4, so no evidence of persistent lost shipments now. I choose L.method="default" (use promised lead time = 4) because concluded history matches promised lead time; mu_hat.method="default" and sigma_hat.method="default" so the OR backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all available demand samples, keeping forecasting conservative and stable given confirmed lead time and substantial pipeline. This balances service (high pipeline + confirmed L=4) against holding cost.

No recent evidence of lost shipments. Demand context: past seed samples provided; use backend defaults to let OR engine compute base-stock with promised lead time. Using default L keeps alignment with observed lead time=4; default mu_hat and sigma_hat let OR compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from samples so ordering balances profit vs holding cost given backend's model.

No new changepoint in demand or lead time detected. Use promised/default lead time so OR backend continues using L=4; use default mu_hat and default sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history. This keeps policy aligned with observed stable LT and long-run demand statistics while avoiding overfitting to recent noise. The sizable in-transit inventory will be reconciled by the OR engine when computing pipeline_inventory.

LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=0, in-transit=2149. Historical conclude messages consistently confirm actual lead time = 4 periods; no new evidence of lost shipments. Demand context: recent historical weekly demands volatile but centered near prior sample mean. I select L=default (promised 4) because concluded history matches promised LT; mu_hat=same default to let backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples; sigma_hat=default so backend computes sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This keeps parameterization simple and leverages the OR engine's cap while relying on confirmed LT and current in-transit stock to balance service level vs holding cost.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=0, in-transit=2358. Historical conclude messages show stable actual lead_time=4 periods across many arrivals, and recent demand history exhibits high weekly demand with occasional spikes (e.g. Periods 30\u201334). Several earlier late/no-arrival episodes resolved into consistent 4-period arrivals. Given confirmed L=4 and substantial pipeline (2358 units) we rely on backend defaults for demand aggregation and volatility so the OR engine can compute base-stock balancing profit vs. holding cost. Using default lead time prevents overreacting to transient missing-conclude noise and leverages the long, stable lead-time evidence.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/18 (Period 41). Demand has been high and variable with recent stockouts; on-hand=36, in-transit=2154. Concluded history shows a sustained actual lead time of 4 periods (consistent arrivals with lead_time=4 across many periods). No evidence of recent lost shipments. To keep the OR engine aligned with observed lead time and historical demand samples, I select the promised/default lead time and use default demand/volatility aggregation ((1+L)\xd7mean, sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so backend computes base_stock from the full sample set. This avoids overreacting to short-term demand spikes while ensuring pipeline covers the L+1 periods of demand given current in-transit stock.

Pipeline + on-hand >> recent demand, so use promised/default stats to let OR engine compute base-stock and cap from full-sample mean/SD.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). Recent history shows a sustained actual lead time of 4 periods (confirmed repeatedly in conclude messages across many periods). Large demand spike in Period 42 (demand=3100) exhausted on-hand (ending on-hand=0). Current on-hand=0, in-transit=2176 \u2014 pipeline partially covers upcoming demand but likely insufficient versus recent peak. To remain consistent with long-run observed lead time and historical samples, use default/promise lead time and let the OR engine compute (1+L)-period demand stats from all samples so orders are sized to the long-run mean and variance; this is conservative given the confirmed stable L=4 and avoids overfitting to the single extreme spike.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). On-hand=0, in-transit=2636. Historical conclude messages consistently show arrivals with lead_time=4 (multiple periods; sustained confirmation through Period 43). Use observed lead time regime (4) so OR sees correct L estimate. Demand historical samples provided seed the forecast; no recent changepoint in demand mean/variance detected from the seed samples, so use default mu/sigma to let backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This balances service (profit $2 vs holding $1) via backend's quantile rule while recognizing confirmed L=4 and substantial pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained actual lead time = 4 periods (evidence: conclude messages showing arrived units from orders placed across many periods with lead_time=4, most recently through Period 43).

LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). SKU 706016001: on-hand=0, in-transit=2858. Historical conclude messages consistently confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (sustained through recent concludes), so use promised/default lead time. Demand samples (seed) show mean \u2248 688.8 per period; with L=4 the review+lead horizon demand \u2248 5\xd7688.8 \u2248 3444 units. Current pipeline (2858) is below that horizon forecast, so the backend will top up toward the base-stock computed from these statistics. Methods chosen are conservative (default) to reflect stable demand/lead-time regime and let the OR engine compute safety stock vs. holding cost tradeoff.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (Period 46). Demand context: recent history shows high, variable weekly demand with several large spikes; past conclude messages consistently confirm actual lead time = 4 periods. On-hand=0, in-transit=2692 => substantial pipeline that will arrive per the 4-period lead-time regime. Given confirmed sustained lead time=4 and no new evidence of lost shipments, use the promised/default lead time to align with OR engine assumptions. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the full sample set; this leverages long-run demand stats and lets the OR engine apply its capped ordering policy against the large existing pipeline, avoiding unnecessary additional orders that raise holding costs while maintaining service.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). On-hand=74, in-transit=2733. Historical conclude messages consistently confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (sustained evidence through Period 46). Pipeline is large relative to on-hand; use promised lead time and default demand estimates to let OR backend compute base stock and cap from full-sample statistics. This balances service (high pipeline, confirmed L=4) against holding cost while avoiding manual over-adjustment given stable lead-time evidence.
