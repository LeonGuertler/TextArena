Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019-02-11). SKU 706016001 has no on-hand or in-transit inventory and no conclude messages to infer actual lead time. Historical demand samples = [694,576,685,715,774], mean = 688.8. Use promised lead time (no evidence to change). Use default demand/volatility calculations so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std, ensuring orders cover the review+lead horizon.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/2/18. Recent demand samples = [694, 576, 685, 715, 774] (mean \u2248 689). On-hand = 0, in-transit = 808 (order placed in Period 1, arrived=0 in Period 1 conclude \u2014 expected given promised lead time=4). No concluded arrivals yet, so no evidence of lead-time miss or lost shipment. Use promised lead time to let OR backend plan for the (L+1)-period demand window; use full-sample statistics (no detected demand regime change) so mu/sigma reflect stable historical mean and volatility. This balances service (protect against stockout over 5 periods) versus holding cost by relying on standard base-stock calculation in OR engine.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019-02-25). Recent raw demands = [694,576,685,715,774], mean=688.8. On-hand=0, in-transit=1601 (two previous orders not yet concluded). Promised lead time=4 and no concluded arrivals in history, so actual lead time cannot be inferred; missing arrivals could be normal given promised L or indicate lost shipments but evidence is insufficient. Use default (promised) L so backend uses contractual lead time. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7sample mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7sample std from all samples \u2014 this leverages full historical demand while the pipeline clears and avoids overreacting to unconfirmed loss signals.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=2383, recent conclude messages show no arrivals for orders placed in Periods 1-3 (arrived=0). Historical demand samples = [694,576,685,715,774] -> mean ~688.8. Promised lead time = 4. No concluded arrivals yet so cannot reliably reduce or recalc lead time; missing arrivals may indicate delayed/lost shipments but insufficient concluded lead-time data. Use default lead time to let OR backend apply promised L=4 and compute (1+L)*mean demand and volatility, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Carry-over insight: No concluded arrivals for orders placed in Periods 1-3 (Period 1-3 conclude: arrived=0); possible delayed or lost shipments \u2014 monitor for arrivals in upcoming concludes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/11 (Period 5). Demand history shows high weekly demand (samples: 694,576,685,715,774 and recent period demands 671,673,539,447). On-hand=0 but large in-transit=3173; however no concluded arrivals for orders placed in Periods 1\u20134 (arrived=0), so shipments may be delayed or lost. Because we have no concluded positive arrivals to infer actual lead time, use the promised lead time (default) so the OR backend retains L=4. Use default demand/volatility estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to let the OR engine compute base_stock while relying on its capping rule to prevent excess ordering given the large pipeline. This approach is conservative: it preserves the backend's statistical forecast while avoiding manual inflation/deflation of forecasts based on unconcluded shipments.

Daily Reward (R_t): $596.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). On-hand=340, in-transit=2498. Historical concluded arrival shows order placed Period 1 arrived in Period 5 (lead_time=4). This confirms actual lead time \u22484 for at least one shipment; earlier zero-arrival concludes likely reflected in-transit delay rather than permanent loss. I therefore set L using 'calculate' to let backend average observed lead times; demand forecast and volatility use defaults so backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of the provided demand samples, balancing service level (profit > holding cost) while avoiding overreaction to transient gaps in arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Observed actual lead time = 4 periods (Period1 order arrived in Period5); prior periods' zero-arrival concludes were due to delay not immediate loss.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). Historical demands = [694,576,685,715,774], mean \u2248688.8. Concluded arrivals show observed lead times = 4 periods (Period1\u2192arrived in P5, Period2\u2192arrived in P6) indicating delays rather than lost shipments. I choose L=calculate to let backend use the averaged observed lead time (captures the 4-period reality). For demand and volatility I select default methods so the OR engine computes mu_hat=(1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples), keeping forecasting anchored to full history while reflecting the chosen lead time. Current on-hand+in-transit = 631+2095=2726; that is likely below (1+L)*mean demand, so the policy will replenish to target while capping order size per the OR cap to limit exposure to holding cost given modest profit margin.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Recent concludes show orders placed in Periods 1-3 all arrived with lead_time=4 (Period5 arrived Period1 order, Period6 arrived Period2 order, Period7 arrived Period3 order) \u2014 earlier zero-arrival concludes were delays, not lost. On-hand=902, in-transit=1760. Set L using calculated average of observed lead times to capture confirmed 4-period lead time. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history; this leverages all demand data while the confirmed L ensures orders cover the full review+lead horizon and avoids underordering given the confirmed 4-period delay.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods based on concluded arrivals: Period5 arrival = order from Period1 (lead_time 4); Period6 arrival = order from Period2 (lead_time 4); Period7 arrival = order from Period3 (lead_time 4).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). Recent concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (Period5-8 arrivals correspond to orders from Period1-4). On-hand 1132 + in-transit 1437 provides ample cover vs recent weekly demands (~468\u2013560). Given confirmed lead time equals promised 4 and no new demand regime detected, use default stats so OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from samples. This keeps parameters aligned with observed lead time, lets OR cap orders per its policy, and avoids overreacting to past delayed arrivals (they were delays, not lost shipments).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

On-hand=930, in-transit=1843 \u2014 pipeline large relative to recent demand. No new evidence of lead-time drift or demand regime change vs. provided historical samples. Use promised/default lead time so OR backend retains 4; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (use full-sample stats) to keep forecasts stable and let backend cap orders given large pipeline, reducing risk of excess holding cost while preserving service level.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). On-hand=1051, in-transit=1711. Concluded arrivals in Periods 5-10 consistently show actual lead time = 4 (orders from Periods 1-6 arrived after 4 periods), so there is no active loss regime \u2014 delays resolved to a 4-period lead time. I set L using calculate to lock in the observed lead time. Demand stats (past samples mean ~688.8) will be used by backend, so I use default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This keeps the base-stock forecast aligned with observed 4-period lead time and avoids under-ordering because of earlier delayed arrivals.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29): on-hand=1237, in-transit=1448. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (orders from Periods 1\u20137 arrived with W=4), so use promised/default lead time. Demand context: recent realized demands (Periods 5\u201311) range ~261\u2013560 with earlier sample vector provided; no strong upward seasonal spike visible in late April. To balance service vs holding cost (profit $2, holding $1 \u2192 target service quantile q=2/(2+1)=0.6667), use default demand estimates so the OR backend computes base_stock = (1+L)*mean(all samples) + z*\u03c3 and caps orders appropriately. This is conservative given substantial pipeline (1448) and high on-hand (1237), reducing risk of over-ordering while maintaining service given confirmed L=4.

On-hand=1365, in-transit=1161 \u2014 pipeline healthy. Use inferred lead time=4 to align pipeline forecast with observed arrivals. Select mu_hat and sigma_hat defaults so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all historical demand samples (uses full sample [694,576,685,715,774]) to balance service level vs holding cost given steady demand and confirmed lead time.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). Recent history shows consistent actual lead time = 4 periods (arrivals in Periods 5-8 matched orders from Periods 1-4). On-hand=1663, in-transit=904 \u2192 ample pipeline coverage vs recent demand (last 9 demand samples trending lower). I set L by calculating observed lead times to confirm actual=promised. For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the downward shift visible in the most recent five demands (Periods 9-13 average \u2248289 per period) and scale by (1+L) in backend. I also set sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent reduced volatility. These choices tighten stocking to avoid excess holding cost while preserving service given confirmed LT=4 and substantial on-hand+pipeline.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). Recent concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple confirms in Periods 5\u201314), so set L to the observed average. Demand history (samples provided) has mean ~688.8; using default demand aggregation lets backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility. On-hand=1732 + in-transit=646 provides substantial cover vs (L+1)-period demand, but keeping mu_hat/sigma_hat as defaults lets OR backend produce a base-stock that balances $2 profit vs $1 holding cost given the confirmed 4-period lead time and avoids overfitting to short-term noise. No evidence of new regime in demand mean/variance requiring Recent/EWMA adjustments.

Period 17 (2019-06-03). Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (Period5+ arrivals link back to Period1-4 orders). On-hand=1188, in-transit=908. No recent lead-time surprises; use inferred lead time via observed data. Set L by calculating average observed lead times to capture confirmed 4-period regime. Use default demand/statistics (all samples) for mu_hat and sigma_hat scaled by (1+L) so OR backend computes base-stock balancing profit ($2) vs holding ($1). This keeps orders aligned with the 5-period demand window and leverages full-sample stability given no detected demand regime shift.

On-hand=1019 and in-transit=1165 provide ample cover versus recent weekly demand; no new lost-shipment signal. Use promised/default lead time to keep OR engine aligned with observed regime. Set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to anchor forecast to the most recent demand samples; use default sigma_hat so backend computes volatility across all samples scaled by sqrt(1+L). These choices prioritize service (profit>$ holding) while avoiding excessive holding by using recent demand for mean and standard historical volatility for safety.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/17 (Period 19). On-hand=557, in-transit=1165. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (arrivals in Periods 5\u201317 reference orders from Periods 1\u201313 with lead_time=4). No recent evidence of lost shipments. Demand history seeded by past samples and period demands; use observed lead-time average to align pipeline forecasting. Chosen methods: L='calculate' to lock in observed lead time = 4 (average of concluded lead times); mu_hat='default' to let backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) so forecast reflects full review+lead horizon; sigma_hat='default' to let backend compute sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples). These choices ensure the OR engine sizes base-stock for the (L+1)-period exposure using empirically confirmed lead time, preserving service while avoiding unnecessary extra safety stock beyond backend cap.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). Recent concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (orders from Periods 1-15 concluded with W=4), on-hand=483, in-transit=1646. Pipeline + on-hand is ample vs recent weekly demand (sales ~240\u2013560 historically), so use inferred lead-time average and default demand estimates to let OR backend compute base stock given profit/holding tradeoff. Using 'calculate' for L captures confirmed L=4 from concludes; default mu/sigma use full-sample stats ((1+L)\xd7mean, sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to avoid overreacting to recent variability and because historical seed samples are limited.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained actual lead time = 4 periods based on concluded arrivals (e.g., Period5 arrival = order from Period1, Period6 = order from Period2, through Period17 arrivals); treat lead time regime as 4 until evidence otherwise.

Actual lead time has been consistently observed = 4 periods through Period 22 concludes, so use promised/default lead time. Inventory position is strong: on-hand=353, in-transit=1770 \u2192 total pipeline=2123, enough to cover multiple weeks at current demand. Use default mu/sigma to let OR backend compute (1+L)-period forecast from full sample history; this is conservative given steady demand and confirmed L=4 and balances service level vs holding cost with profit=$2 vs holding=$1.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22). Historical demand samples mean=688.8 (N=5). Recent concludes consistently show actual lead time = promised 4 periods through Period 23, so use default lead time. Current on-hand 749 + in-transit 1381 = 2130 units (~3.1 periods of average demand) which is short of the target coverage (L+1 = 5 periods); using default statistical estimators gives the OR engine unbiased inputs ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the backend can compute the capped order to balance profit ($2) vs holding cost ($1). No evidence of a new regime shift in demand or lead time this period, so keep defaults to avoid overreacting to normal variability.

No new evidence of lost shipments. Use lead time estimate based on observed lead times to lock in L=4. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from demand samples; this leverages all available demand history and lets the backend set a base-stock that balances the moderate service-level target (profit $2 vs holding $1) against holding cost.

Current on-hand=896, in-transit=1248 \u2014 pipeline ample vs typical weekly demand samples. Profit=2, holding=1 (q=0.667) so OR should aim for service while controlling inventory. I select default lead time (use promised L=4) and default demand/volatility calculations so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from the historical samples; this leverages the established LT=4 regime and lets the OR engine set base-stock balancing profit vs holding cost.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=843, in-transit=1191 \u2014 healthy pipeline but demand history shows moderate weekly demand; no new changepoint in demand or lead time detected. Use promised/default lead time to keep OR engine aligned with observed regime. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from historical samples; this balances service level (profit=2 vs holding=1) via the backend's z* computation while avoiding overfitting to recent noise.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Demand context: recent weekly demands have been moderate (~200-500) after large early-season spikes; historical sample set provided. On-hand=726, in-transit=1182 \u2014 pipeline + on-hand is ample vs typical weekly demand. Lead-time evidence: concluded history consistently shows actual lead time = 4 periods; no new anomalies. Choose L='default' (promised lead time = 4) to match observed stable regime and OR engine expectations. Use mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples \u2014 conservative aggregate forecast that leverages full sample set and the confirmed L=4, producing a base-stock that balances the $2 profit vs $1 holding cost while avoiding overreacting to short-term noise or transient zero-arrival events.

Historical sample mean = 688.8 (samples [694,576,685,715,774]). I set L to the promised/default (4) consistent with confirmed regime. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this keeps ordering anchored to observed demand and the confirmed L=4 while letting the optimizer trade service vs holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). On-hand=0, in-transit=2032. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (orders from Period1 onward). Pipeline (2032) covers multiple periods of expected demand but on-hand is zero so maintain conservative replenishment. Use promised/default lead time (4) since concluded history confirms it. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from samples \u2014 this balances service vs holding cost given steady demand regime and confirmed LT=4.

Carry-over insight: Sustained actual lead time = 4 periods confirmed by concluded arrivals from Period5 through Period31; treat LT regime as 4 until new evidence.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-23 (Period 33). Recent demand has risen sharply since Period 30 (demands: P28-32 = 432,396,740,708,707); evidence of a demand regime shift upward beginning around Period 30. Concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 (sustained through Period 32), so promised LT=4 remains valid. On-hand=0, in-transit=1978 units \u2014 this covers ~3.3 recent 5-period average demands but is short of (1+L)\xd7recent mean (5\xd7~596.6=~2983), so pipeline is currently insufficient to fully cover the review+lead horizon if elevated demand persists. I therefore: keep L at the promised/default (matches observed regime), set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the new higher-demand regime and increased short-term volatility. These parameters will drive orders toward covering the elevated 5-period demand while the OR backend's cap will limit excessive single-period orders.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:

Recent demand history (samples provided) shows high variability with several large weekly demands and stockouts in Periods 30-33. Given confirmed LT=4 and no new evidence of regime change, use the promised/default lead time so OR backend aligns with observed regime. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample set; this leverages all historical demand data while the capped-order rule will limit excessive single-period orders. This choice balances service (maintain coverage over review+lead periods) against holding cost given current large in-transit volume and prior delays.

Date 2019-10-07 (Period 35). On-hand=0, in-transit=2309. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (sustained through recent concludes), so use promised/default lead time. Demand seed samples mean=688.8 (from provided past samples). To balance service vs holding (profit $2 vs hold $1 \u2192 q=2/(2+1)=0.6667), use baseline forecasting: default L and default demand moments so OR backend computes base_stock and cap with full-sample mean/variance. This is conservative given large in-transit volume and confirmed LT=4; relying on defaults avoids overreacting to transient gaps while ensuring pipeline covers (L+1) periods.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). Demand has been volatile with recent large weekly spikes (several periods of stockouts and high demands up to ~1,428). Actual lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history. Current inventory: on-hand=115, in-transit=2007 \u2014 pipeline is large and will cover many future periods. To avoid overreacting to recent demand spikes while letting the OR engine use the long-run stats and the confirmed LT regime, use default lead time and default demand estimates so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history. This keeps orders from amplifying pipeline and balances service vs holding cost given already-large in-transit stock.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date=2019-11-04 (Period 39). On-hand=0, In-transit=2259. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (orders from Periods 1..34 arrived with lead_time=4). In-transit (2259) vs. (L+1)\xd7mean demand \u2248 5\xd7688.8=3444 => pipeline is short of cover for next 5 periods, so maintain lead time estimate of 4 and use population-wide demand moments to compute base-stock. Chosen methods: L by calculate to reflect observed lead times=4; mu_hat default to use (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples)=5\xd7mean; sigma_hat default to use sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples). These settings let the OR backend compute a base-stock that balances the $2 profit vs $1 holding cost given the confirmed LT=4 and the historical demand distribution, while acknowledging current pipeline shortfall so it will order to replenish.

Carry-over insight: Sustained actual lead time = 4 periods confirmed through Period 38 concludes (e.g., Period5 arrival = P1, Period6 = P2 ... Period38 arrival = order from Period34); treat LT regime as 4 until contrary evidence.

On-hand=0, in-transit=2358 \u2014 pipeline substantial and will cover multiple upcoming periods. Use default demand/volatility calculus so OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from historical samples; this balances service (profit/$2 vs holding $1) while avoiding manual over-adjustment given stable LT and no clear demand regime change.

Period 41 (2019-11-18): confirmed sustained actual lead time = 4 periods from concluded history. On-hand=36, in-transit=2154 (large pipeline covering many periods). Demand samples seed = [694,576,685,715,774] (historic). Given stable LT=4 and large pipeline, use default lead time and default demand estimates so OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7sample mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std; this avoids over-adjusting and balances service vs holding given heavy in-transit inventory.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=54, in-transit=2175. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (sustained across many concludes); earlier zero-arrival concludes were delays not losses. Demand samples [694,576,685,715,774] will drive forecast. I select L=default (use promised lead time = 4) because concluded history confirms the 4-period regime; mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR engine computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, letting the backend balance service level vs. holding cost using the profit/holding cost ratio.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods; no new evidence of change. Recent large demand spike in Period 42 (demand=3100) exhausted on-hand (ending 0). Current on-hand=0, in-transit=2066 \u2014 substantial pipeline but not yet observed (arrivals visible next conclude). To respect observed LT regime and let the OR engine compute safety stock/service tradeoff, use the promised/default lead time and default demand moments so backend computes base_stock and cap from full-sample mean/std. This keeps policy aligned with the sustained LT=4 regime while letting the OR engine react numerically to the recent demand history and current pipeline.

Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods; recent large demand spike (Period 42 demand=3100) increases stockout risk near-term. Use default lead time and default demand statistics so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full history; this leverages the confirmed LT=4 regime and lets the backend size safety stock given profit/holding tradeoff.

Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (sustained through Period 44), and recent concludes explain early zero-arrival messages as delays rather than losses. To align with observed regime and keep the OR engine anchored to its defaults (promised LT=4 and demand statistics), I select default L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service level (use observed LT=4) against holding cost given large in-transit volume.

LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019-12-23). On-hand=0, in-transit=2692. Concluded history consistently shows actual lead time = 4 periods; pipeline is large but arrivals are delayed to the 4-period cadence. Profit/holding = $2/$1 implies service-focus but avoid excess holding. Use promised/default LT=4 (matches observed regime). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from demand samples; this leverages full historical demand estimates and lets OR engine cap orders using its cap formula. This choice balances service level given observed LT=4 while letting OR backend respect holding cost through q-based z*.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=74, in-transit=2733 \u2014 ample pipeline but demand history shows high variability including a large spike (Period 42 demand=3100). To respect the confirmed LT regime and let the OR engine combine long-run demand stats with service-level tradeoff, I set L to default (use promised lead time = 4) and use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples. This keeps parameters aligned with the sustained LT=4 regime, leverages full demand history to smooth the Period 42 spike, and avoids overreacting to short-term noise while preserving service level given large pipeline.
