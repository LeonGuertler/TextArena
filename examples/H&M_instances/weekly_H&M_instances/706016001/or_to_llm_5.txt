Decision: follow OR's capped recommendation of 793 units. Rationale: OR already accounts for multi-period demand and caps volatility; combined pipeline (808) + this order (793) gives ~1601 units en route, which is consistent with covering ~2.3 single-period means now while awaiting confirmed arrivals and more lead-time information. Increasing above OR\u2019s cap risks excess holding cost given current uncertainty; reducing risks stockouts only if the in-transit 808 is lost, but we have no concluded evidence of loss yet.
