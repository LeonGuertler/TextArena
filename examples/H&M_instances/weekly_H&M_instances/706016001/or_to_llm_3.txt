Period 47 (2019/12/30) Hybrid Decision:
============================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: concluded history shows actual lead time = 0 (all past orders arrived same period), so orders placed now will arrive during Period 47 and be available for Period 47 demand. Inventory state: on-hand=182, in-transit=0. Recent demand signal: last four concluded periods (Periods 43\u201346) demands = 674, 680, 657, 475 \u2192 average \u2248 622 units; this reflects current demand more than long-ago samples. OR recommendation = 571 units (uses promised L and long-history). Decision logic: because lead time = 0, we only need to cover this period's demand (no pipeline safety for multi-period lead). Target stock to meet expected Period 47 demand \u2248 622 units. Required order = target \u2212 on-hand = 622 \u2212 182 \u2248 440 units. I reduce OR's 571 to 440 to avoid excess holding cost given that recent demand average (~622) is my best short-term forecast and there is no outstanding pipeline. Final action: order 440 units so arrivals satisfy Period 47 demand while limiting holding cost exposure.",
