Promised lead time L=2 \u2192 expected demand over (L+1)=3 periods \u03bc\u0302\u22482066.4. OR's capped recommendation (808) equals approximately one period of demand due to its cap; that would leave stock insufficient to cover the review+lead period and risks stockouts if lead time equals promised 2 periods or increases. Lead-time inference: no concluded arrival messages yet, so actual lead time is unknown \u2014 must assume promised L=2 until proven otherwise. Risk tradeoff: Holding cost is $1/unit/period vs. profit $2/unit; stocking too little risks lost sales (foregone $2 profit per unit), stocking to cover expected 3 periods will incur holding cost but protects sales across the lead time. Decision: order to cover the full (L+1)=3 period expected demand: round(\u03bc\u0302)=2066 units. This ensures pipeline + on-hand will meet expected demand during uncertain lead-time window.
