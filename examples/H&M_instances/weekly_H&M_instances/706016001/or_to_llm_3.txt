Operational view: on-hand+in-transit=2229 units covers ~3.7\u20134.0 periods at recent elevated demand (~560\u2013720); to protect against stockouts given confirmed 4-period lead time and recent elevated demand, I will use the OR cap (\u2248807) rather than the lower OR recommendation (549). Trade-off: ordering up to the cap increases holding cost but reduces costly lost sales given profit>holding and confirmed long lead time. Final action: order 807 units (cap-based safety order to rebuild pipeline to base-stock target over the 5-period lead+review horizon).",
