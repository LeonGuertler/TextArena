{
  "rationale": "Current on-hand=0, in-transit=2171. OR recommends 167 based on promised L=2 and historical demand; its base-stock target (~2,172) is nearly met by pipeline, so it orders little. However actual lead times have been unreliable (carry-over insight) and recent weeks show large spikes (Period 42 demand=3100, and sustained high Dec demand ~650\u2013680), so the reported in-transit may overstate available supply. Profit per unit = $4, holding = $1 \u2192 critical fractile favors availability, but given high holding cost relative to profit we avoid massive over-ordering. I increase OR's recommendation modestly to provide a buffer if some in-transit units are lost or further demand spikes before pending arrivals are confirmed.
