Recent demand included an extreme one-period spike (3100 on 2019/11/25) likely driven by a Black-Friday-like event; it appears to be a one-off rather than a sustained regime shift. Given confirmed lead time =4, long supplier delay, large in-transit balance (1722), high holding cost relative to horizon, and limited remaining periods, I avoid placing additional orders that would likely either arrive too late to be useful across the remaining horizon or create unnecessary holding cost.
