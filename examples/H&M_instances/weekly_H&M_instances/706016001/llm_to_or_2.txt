Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Historical demands = [694,576,685,715,774], mean=688.8, std\u224864.2. On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no concluded arrivals so cannot infer actual lead time or lost shipments. Use promised lead time (4) and default demand estimates so OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7historical mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This balances service (q based on profit $2 vs holding $1) while avoiding unsupported explicit adjustments given no arrival evidence.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/2/18 (Period 2). Recent demands: [694,576,685,715,774], mean \u2248688.8. On-hand=0, in-transit=808 ordered in Period 1 but not yet concluded (no arrivals observed), so actual lead time is still unknown and shipments may be delayed or lost. Use promised/default lead time to avoid premature adjustments; use default demand/volatility calculations to let OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This keeps policy aligned with historical demand while the arrival/lead-time regime is resolved.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019-02-25). Demand history: [694,576,685,715,774] mean ~688. No concluded arrivals yet for orders placed in Periods 1\u20132 (in-transit=1601), consistent with promised lead time (4). Too early to infer lost shipments or shorter/longer actual lead time\u2014use promised lead time and default demand estimates to let OR engine apply its statistical formula. This balances service (covering (1+L) periods) against holding cost given profit=2, holding=1.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04 (Period 4). On-hand=0, in-transit=2383 which equals orders placed in Periods 1-3 (808+793+782)=2383; since promised lead time=4 and those orders were placed recently, no arrivals were yet due \u2014 no evidence of lost/longer lead time. Demand history mean\u2248688.8 (samples [694,576,685,715,774]). I therefore keep L as the promised lead time and use default demand aggregation (no recent changepoint detected). This balances service (covering (1+L) periods of demand) against holding cost given modest profit margin ($2 vs $1 holding).

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Observed no arrivals for orders placed in Periods 1-4 (ordered=808+793+782+790=3173 in-transit; arrived=0 each conclude). This indicates shipments are delayed or lost beyond the promised 4-period lead time. To avoid under-ordering while pipeline is unreliable, I explicitly extend the lead time estimate to 8 periods to increase coverage in the review+lead window. Demand history (5 samples: [694,576,685,715,774]) will be used via recent_N to reflect current demand level across the (1+L) review+lead horizon. Sigma uses default scaling so backend computes volatility from all samples. These choices bias ordering toward higher safety stock to protect service given missing arrivals while letting the OR backend cap orders per its policy.

Carry-over insight: Missing arrivals: orders from Periods 1-4 (total 3173) have not concluded; treat actual lead time as extended/lost until arrivals observed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $596.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18): recent conclude shows arrival=808 (ordered Period 1, lead_time=4), confirming actual lead time = 4 so far. In-transit=3153 equals sum of orders from Periods 2-5 (793+782+790+788=3153) \u2014 those remain undelivered but are visible as pipeline. Use L calculated from observed lead times (only one observed =4) to match reality. Demand history mean = 688.8; with L=4 the review+lead horizon =5 periods \u2192 mu_hat default = 5\xd7mean = 3444 (backend computes). Volatility unchanged; use default sigma_hat so backend scales std by sqrt(1+L). These settings balance service (use observed L) while avoiding over-reacting to in-transit units that are already recorded.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (evidence: Period 5 conclude: arrived=808 ordered Period 1, lead_time=4). In-transit volume 3153 matches orders from Periods 2-5 (793+782+790+788), treat as in-flight rather than lost for now.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). On-hand=631, in-transit=2360. Historical demand samples = [694,576,685,715,774] (mean=688.8). Recent conclude messages confirm orders placed in Periods 1-2 arrived with lead_time=4; pattern supports actual lead time = 4. Use L="calculate" to set lead time from observed concludes. Use mu_hat="default" (backend will compute (1+L)*mean of all samples = 5*688.8) and sigma_hat="default" so volatility uses full-sample std scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances service (maintain coverage for current+L periods) against holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory and confirmed 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (evidence: Period 5 conclude: arrived=808 ordered Period 1, lead_time=4; Period 6 conclude: arrived=793 ordered Period 2, lead_time=4). In-transit volume (~3153 previously; current in-transit 2360) corresponds to recent orders\u2014treat as in-flight rather than lost.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). On-hand=902, in-transit=1760. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (arrivals from Periods 1-3 shown with lead_time=4). No new evidence of lost shipments since Period 7. Choose L='calculate' to lock in observed lead-time regime (backend will average observed lead times). Use mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full demand history, preserving conservative replenishment while the confirmed L=4 is used to size pipeline against (L+1) periods of demand.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:

Current on-hand=1132, in-transit=1437 \u2014 pipeline + on-hand covers several periods of demand but in-transit is from recent orders expected to conclude with LT=4. Use default lead time (promised 4) since observed actual = promised. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, preserving full-sample demand signal (mean ~688.8) and letting OR engine target the profit/holding tradeoff automatically.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15. Recent concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (arrivals from Periods 1-5 arrived with lead_time=4). On-hand=1585 + in-transit=1188 \u2248 2773 covers multiple periods of demand; historical demand samples mean=688.8 (samples: [694,576,685,715,774]). Given clear, stable lead-time evidence, set L to calculated average of observed lead times to match reality. Use default demand pooling (all samples) for mu_hat and default for sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using full history; this balances service level (captures observed lead time and full-sample demand mean) versus holding cost while avoiding overreacting to recent order arrival noise.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:

Historical demand samples mean=688.8 (samples: [694,576,685,715,774]); with L=4 default mu_hat=(1+L)*mean=5*mean and default sigma_hat uses sqrt(1+L)*std. Using defaults keeps OR engine aligned with observed 4-period lead time and the sample-based demand estimate to balance service level vs holding cost given profit=$2/unit and holding=$1/unit.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). On-hand=1237, in-transit=1448.

No new signs of lost shipments. Use promised/default lead time and default demand statistics so the OR engine computes base-stock using the long-run samples; this balances service (observed stable LT=4) against holding cost given current healthy on-hand + in-transit coverage.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). Recent concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (arrivals from Periods 1-8 show W=4). Demand history mean ~689 (samples [694,576,685,715,774]). On-hand=1365 + in-transit=1161 = 2526 units; required coverage for (1+L)=5 periods \u2248 3445 units, so pipeline is short vs. full coverage. I set L to default (promised 4) because concluded history matches the promised lead time. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this leverages full stable sample set and the confirmed L to balance service level vs. holding cost given tight pipeline and moderate demand variability.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). Recent concluded history consistently shows actual lead time = 4 periods; on-hand=1663 and in-transit=904 provide ample coverage vs. recent weekly demands (hist mean ~688.8 from provided samples). No new lost-shipment signal. Use promised/default lead time so OR backend uses stable L=4 and computes mu_hat and sigma_hat from full sample history ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This balances service (consistent 4-period arrivals) against holding cost given healthy on-hand + pipeline.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019/5/27). Recent concluded history consistently shows actual lead time = 4 periods (arrivals from orders placed 4 periods earlier). On-hand=1541, in-transit=746. Demand history seed samples available. No clear recent demand regime shift; use promised/confirmed L=4 and standard population estimates so OR backend can compute base-stock and cap. This keeps service-level appropriate while avoiding over-adjusting for transient noise or earlier missing arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (evidence: multiple conclude messages showing arrivals with lead_time=4, e.g., Period 5,6,7 concl.). Treat recent in-transit as in-flight rather than lost.

LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). Recent conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods. On-hand=1188, in-transit=908; pipeline + on-hand covers multiple weeks of recent demand, no evidence of new lost shipments. Historical demand samples (seed) show mean ~689 and moderate variability. I select default lead time to use the promised 4-periods, and default demand mean/volatility so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this leverages the full history to set base_stock and the capped order cap, balancing service level (profit-driven q) versus holding cost given current healthy on-hand+pipeline.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10 (Period 18). Historical conclude messages consistently show arrivals with lead_time=4 (Periods 5\u201317 concl. evidence), so actual lead time is confirmed at 4 and in-transit units (1165) should be treated as in-flight. On-hand=1019, in-transit=1165. Demand samples available (historical seed). To keep the OR backend aligned with observed lead time and stable demand statistics, I use the default lead time (promised = 4) and default demand estimators so the engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This is conservative given no recent changepoint in demand and avoids overreacting to short-term noise while the pipeline clears. Defaults balance service level vs. holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

No evidence of new changepoints in demand or lead time. Use promised lead time to match observed regime. Set L to default (promised=4). Use mu_hat default to let backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean of all demand samples (captures five-sample prior mean ~689 and scales for 5-period coverage). Use sigma_hat default so backend computes sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples, preserving observed volatility scaling.

Historical sample mean demand ~688 (past demands provided), so (1+L)\xd7mean \u2248 5\xd7688 \u2248 3440, meaning current inventory+pipeline is short of target cover for (L+1) periods. Use promised lead time (default) and let OR backend compute base_stock and order quantity using default demand mean/variance to restore coverage while respecting capped order. Methods chosen: L=default to reflect confirmed promised lead time; mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so backend uses full-sample mean/std scaled by (1+L), allowing it to compute safety stock given profit/holding cost tradeoff.

Demand history seeded by provided samples. Use promised/default lead time and default demand statistics so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this keeps parameters aligned with confirmed LT=4 and historical demand while the backend applies the capped ordering policy to balance service vs holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=896, in-transit=1248. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods; promised lead time = 4. Recent demand history (samples provided) centers near ~689 units per period. No evidence of a new demand regime or lost shipments since arrivals have matched 4-period lead_time in concluded messages. Choose default lead time to keep OR consistent with promise and observed pattern. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing a stable base-stock that balances service (profit $2 vs holding $1) given steady demand and confirmed L=4.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=843, in-transit=1191. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead_time=4 (arrivals from Periods 1..26 with lead_time=4); recent in-transit matches expected in-flight rather than lost. I therefore use the promised/confirmed lead time (default) and let the OR backend compute demand across the review+lead horizon and volatility from the full sample history (default mu_hat and default sigma_hat). This keeps the policy aligned with observed L=4, uses all demand history to estimate (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std, and balances service-level vs holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19 (Period 28). Historical concluded messages consistently show actual lead_time = 4 periods (multiple confirms through Period 27). On-hand=726, in-transit=1182; pipeline + on-hand (~1908) comfortably covers several weeks of recent demand (weekly demand \u2248 mid-300s\u2013400s). No new missing arrivals observed. Use promised/default lead time (4). Use default demand/volatility estimates so OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history, balancing service level (via base-stock) against holding cost given profit=2, holding=1.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Recent concluded history consistently shows actual lead time = 4 periods. On-hand=643, in-transit=1331 \u2014 pipeline appears healthy and corresponds to recent in-flight orders (no new evidence of lost shipments). Demand context: historical sample mean from provided past demands supports baseline demand; no clear changepoint in demand level or variance in recent concl. I therefore use default lead time (promised 4), and default demand/statistics so the OR engine will compute mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This keeps the backend's base-stock anchored to long-run observed demand while relying on confirmed L=4 to size pipeline coverage and avoid overreacting to transient noise.

On-hand=442, in-transit=1563 \u2014 pipeline appears healthy versus steady historical demand (no recent changepoint). Use promised/default lead time and demand estimates so OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of full sample set; this balances service (confirmed L=4) and holding cost given stable demand.

No recent changepoint in demand; use conservative/default estimates so OR backend (which assumes promised LT=4) gets consistent inputs. I therefore keep L=default (promised 4), and use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). Recent weeks show strong weekly demand with stockouts in Periods 30\u201331; on-hand=0, in-transit=2032. Historical sample mean \u2248689/wk -> (1+L) demand \u22483444 over review+lead. Lead time has been consistently 4 periods in concluded history; no clear recent changepoint in demand variance. I therefore keep L at the promised/observed default 4 and let the OR engine compute mu_hat and sigma_hat from the full sample (default) so the backend produces the base-stock that trades service level vs holding cost given known profit/holding costs. This leverages confirmed lead-time=4 and avoids overfitting short-term noise while acknowledging current pipeline is insufficient to cover the (L+1)-period demand estimate.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/23 (Period 33). Demand has been high recently with several stockouts (Periods 30-32 sold-to-zero). On-hand=0, in-transit=1978 units that match recent orders and prior conclude messages. Actual lead time has been consistently observed = 4 periods (multiple conclude entries). I therefore use the promised/default lead time to align with observed regime. I select default for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all provided demand samples, letting the solver set base-stock and cap given profit/holding tradeoff while accounting for the 4-period pipeline. This balances service level (avoid further stockouts) against holding costs given substantial in-transit inventory.

In-transit looks like in-flight inventory (not lost). Given consistent 4-period lead time and no recent changepoint in demand, use the promised/default lead time and default demand estimators so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=0, in-transit=2180. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead_time=4 periods. Demand samples provided seed the forecast. I choose default for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat so the OR backend uses the promised lead time (4) and the full-sample mean/std scaling ((1+L)\xd7mean, sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This is appropriate because lead time has been stable at 4 and using full-sample statistics lets the backend compute the base-stock that balances the $2 profit vs $1 holding cost.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=0, in-transit=2212. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods; recent arrivals align with orders placed 4 periods earlier. Pipeline (2212) likely covers several future periods of demand but arrival confirmations lag one period. Using default methods (promised L=4) keeps OR engine aligned with observed stable LT and uses full-sample demand stats for \u03bc\u0302/\u03c3\u0302 so the backend's capped base-stock will balance service vs holding cost given steady demand regime.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). Recent concluded history consistently shows actual lead time = 4 periods; on-hand=0, in-transit=2149 units (so shipments are in-flight). Demand samples seeded by provided history; no clear recent changepoint in demand mean/variance that would justify deviating from statistical defaults. I therefore use the promised/default lead time and default demand/volatility calculations so the OR engine computes base_stock and cap from full-sample statistics. This keeps the policy aligned with observed L=4 arrivals while avoiding overfitting to short-term noise. Default settings also ensure pipeline + on-hand target covers (1+L) periods of demand as required.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=0, in-transit=2358. Concluded history consistently shows arrivals with lead_time=4 (several Period X conclude messages), so actual lead time = 4 is confirmed. I use the promised/default lead time so OR backend uses L=4. Demand history is stable enough and recent vols are captured in full-sample stats, so use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This keeps policy aligned with observed 4-period arrivals and lets the OR engine balance service level vs holding cost using full-sample estimates.

Use promised/default lead time and default demand statistics so the OR backend applies (1+L) scaling to historical samples; this leverages confirmed L=4 and lets the backend compute base_stock and cap from the full-sample mean/std, balancing service level vs holding cost given large pipeline.

Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple conclude messages with lead_time=4); recent large in-transit balances match expected in-flight receipts, not losses. To maintain service while controlling holding cost, use the promised lead time and full-sample demand stats so the OR engine computes base_stock and cap from all historical demand data.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019/12/2). On-hand=0, in-transit=2176. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods. Recent large spike (Period 42 demand=3100) drained inventory to 0; pipeline (2176) will cover some upcoming demand but not the spike. I therefore use the default lead time (promised L=4) because concluded history confirms LT=4, and default mu_hat/sigma_hat so the OR backend uses (1+L)\xd7sample mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7sample std from the provided demand samples to compute base-stock and cap. This balances service (keep coverage for the 5-period window) vs holding cost given current empty on-hand and substantial in-transit.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:

Demand history (seed samples) mean ~688.8 with occasional spikes (e.g., period 42). No evidence of new lead-time regime or lost shipments. Use promised/default lead time and default demand statistics so OR backend computes base-stock from full-sample mean/variance and the known profit/holding cost tradeoff.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). Recent conclude history consistently shows actual lead_time = 4 periods; on-hand=0, in-transit=2858 (treat as in-flight). Historical demand samples mean \u2248688.8 (samples: [694,576,685,715,774]). To balance service vs holding cost use promised lead time and population-based demand estimates so OR backend computes base_stock and caps with full-sample stats. Methods: L=default to keep L=4 (promised and historically confirmed); mu_hat=default to use (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples (\u22483444); sigma_hat=default to use sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples. This keeps orders aligned with observed lead time and full-sample demand volatility while relying on OR engine caps to limit order size given large in-transit.

Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead_time=4 (multiple arrivals labeled lead_time=4), so use calculated lead time to reflect observed regime. Demand history available; no clear recent changepoint in the supplied demand samples, so use default demand aggregation for mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). These settings instruct the OR engine to target a base-stock appropriate for a 4-period lead (covers current+L future demand) while letting the backend compute safety stock from observed variability. Treat existing in-transit as in-flight (not lost) per conclude evidence; using calculate L avoids being misled by transient gaps.

LLM Rationale:

Historical conclude messages consistently show arrivals with lead_time=4 (multiple periods), so treat actual lead time as standard 4 and pipeline as in-flight (no evidence of recent losses). Inventory+pipelined volume is large relative to recent demand; to let the OR engine compute the service-level tradeoff using full history, use default demand & volatility aggregation and default lead time (promised=4). This keeps base-stock calculation anchored to long-run mean and variance while avoiding aggressive manual overrides given stable lead-time evidence.
