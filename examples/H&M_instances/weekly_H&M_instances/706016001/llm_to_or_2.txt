Running full CSV horizon: 47 periods

Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. No on-hand or in-transit inventory; no concluded arrivals to infer actual lead time. Historical demands = [694,576,685,715,774] (mean ~689.8). Promised lead time is 4 periods and with no evidence to the contrary I use the default lead time so the OR backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history. This balances service level (covering L+1 periods) against holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
2019-02-18 (Period 2). Recent demand samples = [694,576,685,715,774] (mean=688.8, std\u224864.34). On-hand=0, in-transit=808 (ordered Period 1) but no arrivals concluded yet \u2192 no observed actual lead-time. Use promised lead time and full-sample demand stats. Set L to default (promised 4). Use mu_hat default to capture (1+L)\xd7mean across all samples (5\xd7688.8) and sigma_hat default to capture sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples (\u221a5\xd7~64.34). This keeps the OR engine anchored to historical demand while acknowledging the outstanding in-transit shipment; if the shipment fails to conclude in future periods we will reassess lead time.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019-02-25). Recent demand samples = [694,576,685,715,774], mean=688.8. On-hand=0, in-transit=1601 (equals 808+793 ordered in Periods 1\u20132); no arrivals have concluded yet so actual lead time cannot be inferred. Use promised lead time (default L=4) and default demand estimates so the OR backend uses full historical mean/variance across the (1+L) review+lead window. This keeps policy conservative (service-oriented) while the pipeline is monitored for concluded arrivals; defaults let the backend compute base_stock and cap given profit/holding tradeoff.

Carry-over insight: No concluded arrivals so far; in-transit (1601) equals orders from Periods 1\u20132 (808+793). Cannot infer actual lead time yet; treat as delayed rather than confirmed lost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (2019-03-04). Recent concludes show zero arrivals for three consecutive periods; in-transit=2383 equals sum of orders (808+793+782) so shipments are delayed but not yet confirmed lost. On-hand=0; expected demand history available but no clear changepoint in demand. Use promised lead time (default) because no concluded arrivals exist to infer a different L. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7sample mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7sample std from full demand history; this keeps forecasts conservative while the shipment status resolves and balances service level vs holding cost.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). On-hand=0, in-transit=3173 (orders from P1\u2013P4). No concluded arrivals for any past orders\u2014cannot infer actual lead time; treat as delayed, not lost. Promised lead time will be used (default) since there are no observed lead-time conclusions to calculate an alternative. Demand history samples = [694,576,685,715,774]; use default demand/volatility calculations so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std with L=promised. This keeps the OR engine anchored to historical mean while the pipeline anomaly is monitored; using defaults avoids overreacting to currently unconfirmed delays.

Carry-over insight: No concluded arrivals through Period 4; in-transit (3173) equals orders from Periods 1\u20134 \u2014 treat as delayed (not confirmed lost) until conclude messages show arrivals or further delays.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). On-hand=340, in-transit=2498; recent conclude (Period 5) showed arrived=808 (ordered Period 1, lead_time=4) confirming at least one 4-period lead time. No other concludes yet; outstanding shipments should be treated as delayed, not lost. I set L via 'calculate' to let the backend average observed lead times (evidence: Period 5 conclude \u2192 lead_time=4). I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as 'default' so the OR engine uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all demand samples, providing a conservative base-stock that balances the $2 profit vs $1 holding cost while accounting for the confirmed 4-period arrival.

Carry-over insight: Observed confirmed lead_time=4 for order placed in Period 1 (Period 5 conclude: arrived=808, ordered on Period 1, lead_time=4); treat remaining in-transit as delayed until further concludes.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25): on-hand=631, in-transit=2095. Two concluded arrivals show lead_time=4 (orders from P1 arrived in P5, P2 in P6) \u2014 treat remaining pipeline as delayed but consistent with L=4. Recent realized demand has fallen from earlier high values; I use a recent-window demand estimate to reflect the lower recent mean and volatility so the OR base-stock balances service vs holding cost.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). On-hand=902, in-transit=1313 (matches orders from Periods 4\u20136: 790+133+390). Historical demand samples = [694,576,685,715,774] (mean \u2248 688.8). Recent conclude messages show arrivals for orders placed in Periods 1\u20133 with lead_time=4 each, so actual lead time appears to be 4. No concluded arrivals for orders from Periods 4\u20136 yet; treat them as delayed but expected to arrive consistent with lead_time=4. To keep the OR backend aligned with observed stable demand and confirmed lead time, use default statistical aggregations (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std with L=promised/observed). This balances service (use full 5-period demand coverage) vs holding cost given modest profit/holding ratio.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed consistent lead_time=4 for orders placed on Periods 1\u20133 (evidence: Period 5\u20137 conclude messages showing arrived units from Periods 1\u20133 with lead_time=4); treat remaining in-transit as delayed until their conclude messages arrive.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:

Date 2019/4/8 (Period 9).

On-hand=1132, in-transit=1308. I set L to 'calculate' to let backend use observed lead times (confirmed=4). Demand samples show no clear regime shift, so use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples). This keeps the OR base-stock anchored to full review+lead demand while accounting for observed lead time, balancing service vs holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). On-hand=1051, in-transit=1711. Conclude history shows consistent arrivals with lead_time=4 for orders placed in Periods 1\u20136 (Period 5\u201310 concludes), so actual lead time regime is 4. I set L via 'calculate' to reflect observed lead times. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from demand history; this balances service level given confirmed L=4 while avoiding overfitting to recent noise. Current on-hand + in-transit (2762) appears sufficient vs. short-term demand, and using observed L reduces risk of underordering due to delayed arrivals.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). On-hand=790, in-transit=1895. Historical concluded messages show consistent observed lead_time=4 for orders placed in Periods 1\u20136 (all concluded lead_time=4), so actual lead time is confirmed at 4. Past demand samples = [694,576,685,715,774]; no recent demand regime shift evident. Use L='calculate' to lock to observed average lead time (4) so the OR engine accounts for true pipeline timing. Use mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample set, providing a stable base-stock that balances the $2 profit vs $1 holding cost given confirmed L and no strong demand change. This conservative choice also avoids overreacting to the one period with arrived=0 (Period 11) which is within expected variability of arrivals timing.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06): on-hand=1236, in-transit=1290. Historical demand samples = [694,576,685,715,774] (mean=688.8, std\u224864.36). Concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead_time=4 for prior orders (Periods 5\u201312 conclude messages). No evidence of lost shipments currently. Use promised/observed lead time = 4 and pool all historical demand samples for demand estimates to keep service high while letting OR backend compute safety stock given profit/holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained lead_time=4 based on concluded arrivals for orders placed in Periods 1\u20138 (evidence: Period 5\u201312 conclude messages showing lead_time=4).

Demand samples provided; no recent changepoint in demand mean/variance detected. Given confirmed LT=4 and stable demand, use default estimators so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample set. This keeps the OR engine aligned with observed LT and avoids overfitting to short-term noise while balancing service level (profit $2 vs holding $1).

No outstanding evidence of lost shipments; arrivals follow 4-period lead. Demand history shows moderate, stable weekly demand.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). Recent demand has moderated from earlier highs to ~200-500/week (last 5 observed demands: 261,339,241,189,375; mean ~281). On-hand=1541, in-transit=746; pipeline + on-hand covers several weeks so avoid aggressive ordering. Lead time has been consistently 4 periods in concluded history (Periods 5\u201315 conclude). I choose L=calculate to let backend confirm observed lead-time average (evidence: many concluded arrivals showing lead_time=4). For demand forecast I target the recent regime: use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to reflect the lower recent mean over the last 5 demands and avoid overstock. For volatility I also use recent_N (N=5) so safety stock reflects recent variability. These settings reduce overstating future demand while preserving service given ample on-hand inventory.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained lead_time=4 extended through Period 15 (evidence: conclude messages in Periods 5\u201315 showing arrivals with lead_time=4); treat remaining in-transit as delayed until their conclude messages arrive.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). Demand history shows stable weekly demand (samples mean \u2248688.8) and concluded arrivals consistently indicate actual lead_time=4. Current inventory: on-hand=1188, in-transit=566 (no overdue lost shipments signaled; recent concludes have been timely with L=4). Use promised lead time to align with confirmed behavior and keep forecasting simple: set L to default (promised=4). Use default demand sizing: mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) to reflect full review+lead demand based on stable historical mean. Use default volatility: sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples). These choices keep the OR engine's base-stock calculation aligned with observed stable demand and confirmed 4-period lead time while avoiding overreacting to short-term noise.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10 (Period 18). Demand history shows stable weekly demand with no recent regime shift; concluded arrivals consistently indicate actual lead_time=4 (orders placed in Periods 1\u201313 have concluded with W=4). On-hand=1019, in-transit=1065 (pipeline + on-hand sufficient short-term). I set L to 'calculate' to lock in observed lead_time=4 from concluded messages. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7sample mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7sample std from the full demand history, maintaining service while controlling holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained actual lead_time=4 extended through orders placed in Period 13 (evidence: Period 17 conclude: arrived=282 units ordered on Period 13, lead_time=4).

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead_time=4 for orders through Period 14\u201317; arrivals have matched promised L=4. Current inventory: on-hand=727, in-transit=1432 (outstanding shipments expected per L=4). Demand history seed available; no evidence of recent regime shift in demand mean/volatility. I therefore use default lead time (promised L=4) and default demand estimates so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level against holding cost while relying on confirmed lead-time=4.

On-hand=483 + in-transit=1770 gives ample coverage vs recent demand; no evidence of new lost shipments.

Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead_time=4 for concluded arrivals through Period 17, so I set L via calculate to let backend use observed lead times. Demand samples (seed) = [694,576,685,715,774]; no recent changepoint in demand detected, so use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend will compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std).

No evidence of lost shipments; pipeline + on-hand sufficient given historical demand. Use promised/default lead time and default demand stats so OR backend computes base_stock from all historical samples (conservative given stable lead time and no recent regime shift).

Current on-hand=790, in-transit=1333; pipeline plus on-hand comfortably covers multiple periods of demand but some recent orders had zero arrivals at their expected conclude (e.g. Periods 11 and 20 had 0 arrivals) \u2014 nonetheless overall concluded lead times =4 with no evidence of persistent loss. Use default methods so OR backend applies promised lead time (4) and full-sample demand statistics for (1+L) forecast and volatility, balancing service level and holding cost given modest holding cost relative to profit ($1 vs $2).

Period 24 (2019/7/22). On-hand=873, in-transit=1257. Historical concluded arrivals show a sustained actual lead_time=4 (consistent arrivals with lead_time=4 through Period 17), so promised lead time=4 remains valid. Recent observed demand has moderated relative to the earlier small-sample prior; to adapt the forecast I use a recent-N demand estimate (short window) for mu_hat while keeping sigma_hat default to let backend use full-sample volatility. Using recent_N for mu_hat increases responsiveness while L=default relies on the promised 4-period lead time confirmed by concludes; this balances service (avoid stockouts given long lead time) versus holding cost given healthy on-hand + in-transit.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Historical concluded data consistently show actual lead_time = 4 periods; demand has stabilized after earlier peaks with recent weekly demands ~232\u2013393. On-hand=970 and in-transit=928 provide strong coverage vs. expected demand. Use default lead time (promised=4) consistent with observed actuals; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history, balancing service level vs holding cost given ample pipeline.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Historical concluded messages consistently show actual lead_time=4 for orders (Periods 5\u201325 concludes). On-hand=896, in-transit=1248 \u21d2 total pipeline=2144, which is below (1+L)*historical mean demand (\u22483444) so we remain exposed to stockshort risk if demand follows historical mean. Given strong, sustained evidence of lead_time=4 and no recent demand regime shifts, use default lead time and default demand stats so the OR engine computes base_stock and caps using full-sample mean/std. This keeps parameter updates conservative while allowing the OR backend to balance service level vs holding cost.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=843, in-transit=1191. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead_time=4 for arrivals through Period 26 (orders placed up to Period 22). Demand history and product (jeans) show stable weekly demand pattern. Given confirmed LT=4, use promised/default lead time to align OR backend with observed arrivals. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level vs holding cost under profit=$2 / holding=$1.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained actual lead_time=4 extended through orders placed in Periods 1\u201322 (evidence: conclude messages in Periods 5\u201326 showing arrivals with lead_time=4).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Recent conclude history confirms sustained actual lead_time=4 through orders placed up to Period 23\u201326; no evidence of lost shipments. On-hand=726, in-transit=1182; pipeline + on-hand covers several weeks of average demand. Use promised/default lead time (4) since concluded arrivals consistently show LT=4. Use default demand/volatility estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean, sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) based on all historical samples to keep conservative, stable ordering and avoid understock during confirmed 4-period lead time.

Historical concludes show a sustained actual lead_time=4 for orders placed through Period 23 (consistent 4-period arrivals); no new lost-shipment signal. Use promised/default lead time and default demand estimators so OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from available samples \u2014 this balances service level (captures observed 4-period lead) against holding cost given current healthy on-hand + pipeline.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). On-hand=442, in-transit=1563. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead_time=4 for concluded arrivals through the history; no evidence of lost shipments\u2014shipments simply arrive with 4-period lag. Demand history (recent periods) is stable with no detected changepoint. I therefore use the default lead time (promised=4) and default demand/volatility estimators so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, which balances service level against holding cost given steady demand and confirmed L=4.

Recent demand spike (Period 30 demand=740, sold=713 -> stockout) but historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead_time=4 (conclude messages Periods 5\u201330 show arrivals with lead_time=4). Treat in-transit as valid incoming stock. Use default methods so backend uses promised/confirmed lead_time and full-sample demand stats: L=default because actual lead_time is sustained at 4; mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default to let OR engine compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given stable lead-time evidence.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/23 (Period 33). Demand context: recent concluded demands show repeated high weekly demand with occasional stockouts (Periods 30\u201332 sold out). Historical sample seed = [694,576,685,715,774]. Concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead_time=4 (evidence through Period 32 conclude). In-transit=1978; on-hand=0, so must cover (1+L) review+lead demand. I set L by calculating observed lead times to reflect confirmed actual lead_time=4. I use default statistical forecasting for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing a stable base-stock while the backend's cap limits order size to prevent over-ordering given the long lead. This balances service level (avoid stockouts) against holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained actual lead_time=4 extended through orders placed in Period 28 (evidence: Period 32 conclude: arrived=498 units ordered on Period 28, lead_time=4).

On-hand=0, in-transit=2084 (covers ~3.0 periods at recent mean demand). I choose default lead time to match promised L=4 and use default demand moments so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This keeps policy aligned with confirmed LT=4, uses full-sample demand estimates (mu_hat=3444 implicitly) and maintains service-level sizing while avoiding overreaction to recent high-variance spikes (Period 33 demand spike).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). Recent history shows sustained actual lead_time=4 (concluded arrivals through Period 36). On-hand=0, in-transit=2180 (pipeline present). Demand history (seed samples) and many concluded weekly demands indicate relatively high and variable weekly demand; given confirmed L=4 and a full pipeline, use defaults so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This keeps the base-stock anchored to the full-sample estimate and lets the capped order cap limit excessive same-period ordering while balancing $2 profit vs $1 holding cost.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/10/28 (Period 38). On-hand=0, in-transit=2212. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead_time = 4 (orders placed in Periods 1\u201333 concluded with lead_time=4). No evidence of lost shipments beyond normal delays. Use promised/observed lead time to size the replenishment window and let OR backend compute demand scaling and safety stock from historical samples. Methods chosen: keep L as default (promised 4), mu_hat default ((1+L)\xd7mean of samples) and sigma_hat default (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR engine uses stable long-run stats and the capped ordering rule to balance service level vs holding cost while accommodating the 4-period transit.

Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=0, in-transit=2358. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead_time=4 (arrivals from orders placed 4 periods earlier across history). No evidence of lost shipments; pipeline expected to arrive with 4-period lead. Use promised/default lead time and default demand aggregation so OR backend uses full-sample mean/variance scaled by (1+L) to compute base stock. This keeps service high while relying on observed stable lead time and historical demand.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). Demand history shows elevated weekly demand with recent stockouts and large arrivals; confirmed sustained actual lead_time=4 in prior concludes. Current on-hand=36 and in-transit=2154 \u2014 pipeline is large and consistent with prior orders but on-hand is very low so we must maintain service. I use L=default (promised lead time=4) because concluded history confirms lead_time=4 and the backend expects the promised value; mu_hat and sigma_hat set to default so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the provided samples, letting the backend produce the capped order that balances profit vs holding cost given the provided demand stats. This keeps parameters simple, leverages confirmed lead-time, and avoids overreacting to short-term inventory noise while ensuring pipeline coverage for L+1 periods.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead_time=4 for many periods (concludes Periods 5\u201341 show arrivals with lead_time=4), so set L to promised (4). No clear recent demand regime shift in the provided sample set, so use default demand estimators: mu_hat and sigma_hat default (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples). This keeps the OR engine rooted in long-run sample stats while respecting confirmed lead time; it balances service level (through base-stock sizing) against holding cost given Profit=$2 and Holding=$1.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1204.00

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). Recent history shows one extreme demand spike (Period 42 demand=3100) but overall lead-time has been consistently observed =4 periods in conclude messages. Current inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=2176 (pipeline covers future arrivals at L=4). To avoid overreacting to the single-period spike and because concluded arrivals confirm actual lead_time=4, use default/robust statistics: L=default (promised 4), mu_hat=default ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and sigma_hat=default (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples). This keeps orders sized by long-run demand while the pipeline (2176) and confirmed LT=4 handle timing of arrivals and mitigate lost-shipment risk.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained actual lead_time=4 extended through orders placed in Periods 1\u201338 (evidence: conclude messages in Periods 5\u201342 showing arrived units with lead_time=4).

Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead_time=4 for confirmed arrivals through Period 43; no evidence of lost shipments\u2014treat actual lead time = promised 4. Demand history seed provided; no recent changepoint in the provided sample set that justifies deviating from the backend's default aggregation. To keep orders aligned with observed steady lead time and let the OR engine compute the review+lead demand and safety stock, use default lead time and default demand/volatility calculations so backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across samples.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16 (Period 45). Demand history shows high variability with occasional large spikes (notably Period 42 demand=3100). Actual lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded messages through the history, and current on-hand=0 with in-transit=2858 (large pipeline). To avoid over-ordering given substantial pipeline and holding cost, use promised/default lead time and let backend compute mu_hat/sigma_hat from full sample history. This defers replenishment until pipeline arrivals are observed and keeps service/holding balance conservative.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019-12-23): on-hand=0, in-transit=2692. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead_time=4 (orders from many periods concluded with lead_time=4). Several earlier delays resolved into a sustained 4-period lead time. I will use the promised/default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend uses the full historical sample to compute (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility; this leverages the long history and the confirmed L=4 while allowing the backend's capped ordering rule to limit per-period receipts. This acknowledges in-transit stock (delayed but not lost) and balances service vs. holding cost.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30 (Period 47). Historical conclude messages consistently confirm actual lead_time=4 over long window (Periods 5\u201346 conclude arrivals all show lead_time=4). On-hand=74, in-transit=2733; pipeline + on-hand comfortably covers several periods. Use promised/default lead time and default demand estimates based on full sample history to let OR backend compute base-stock and cap using established statistics; this aligns safety stock to profit/holding tradeoff while respecting observed L=4 and avoiding manual over-adjustment given large pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained actual lead_time=4 through orders placed in Periods 1\u201342 (evidence: conclude messages in Periods 5\u201346 showing arrivals with lead_time=4).
