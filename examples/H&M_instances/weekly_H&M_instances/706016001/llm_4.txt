No prior arrivals/concludes yet to contradict promised LT and no in-transit inventory. Inventory assessment: On-hand=0, In-transit=0. Decision logic: Because arrivals placed now will not arrive until Period 3 (lead time 2) and current-period demand occurs after ordering, we must cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand with on-hand+in-transit+order. Using the historical mean demand \u2248688 units/period \u2192 3-period demand \u2248 2064 units.
