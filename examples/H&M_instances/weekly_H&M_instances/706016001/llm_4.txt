Ordering implications: An order placed now arrives in Period 48 and must cover demand from P48 onward; to cover the next 5 periods (P44\u2013P48) at an elevated forecast \u2248650\u2013660/hrpd would require ~3250 units. Existing pipeline (2440) leaves a shortfall \u2248810. Given profit $2/unit vs holding $1/unit/period, avoid stockouts while not overstocking for prolonged holding. Action: place an order to cover the shortfall (~810 units) arriving in Period 48.",
