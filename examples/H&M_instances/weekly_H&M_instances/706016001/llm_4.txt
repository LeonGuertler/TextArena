P42 (3100) is an outlier (likely Black Friday) so use ~700 units/period as short-term demand estimate. c) Lead time / pipeline: Actual lead time confirmed = 4 periods. Orders placed now (P46) will arrive in P50 and cannot help immediate P46\u2013P49 demand. Current on-hand=0, in-transit=2803 units. d) Inventory assessment: Using target coverage of (L+1)=5 periods => 5 * 700 = 3500 units to cover next 5 periods. Pipeline shortfall = 3500 - (0 + 2803) = 697 units. e) Order decision: Place enough to cover the shortfall while being conservative on holding cost.
