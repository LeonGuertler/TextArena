With promised lead time L=4, OR computes \u03bc\u0302=(1+L)*\u03bc\u0304=5*688.8=3,444 and \u03c3\u0302=\u221a5*71.8\u2248160.6, giving a base stock \u22483,579 and an uncapped order \u22483,579 \u2212 pipeline(1,601) \u22481,978.

Step 2 \u2014 timing & pipeline realism: On-hand=0 and pipeline=1,601 (orders from P1 and P2) have not yet concluded, but promised lead time is 4 periods and only 2 periods have elapsed, so there is no definitive evidence of lost shipments \u2014 do not treat pipeline as lost. Step 3 \u2014 risk trade-off: Covering (L+1)=5 periods of expected demand requires ~3,444 units; pipeline alone (1,601) is insufficient. Ordering up to OR's cap (\u2248807) balances avoiding severe stockouts if the pipeline arrives late and limiting excess holding cost given moderate demand variability. Step 4 \u2014 final decision: place an order of 807 units (slightly above OR's 782 to reflect full cap computed from stats). This yields pipeline+order = 1,601+807 = 2,408 in-transit/on-hand exposure; still below full 5-period demand if all pipeline were lost, but given no concluded evidence of loss and the OR cap constraint, 807 is a prudent compromise between stockout risk and holding cost.",
