Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period start 2019-02-11. SKU 706016001 has on-hand=0, in-transit=0 and no concluded arrivals to infer lead-time changes. Historical demands [694,576,685,715,774] show stable mean (~688.8) and moderate volatility (~64.2). No calendar spikes evident for mid-February. Use promised lead time (no evidence to change) and default demand stats so backend computes base-stock from full-sample mean/SD. This keeps policy conservative given zero inventory and avoids overfitting to short-term noise.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/2/18. Recent demand history mean ~688.8 (samples [694,576,685,715,774]) and no arrivals observed yet: Period 1 conclude shows ordered=808 arrived=0 so actual lead time is not inferable (could be in-transit or delayed). On-hand=0, in-transit=808 covers some future demand but arrival timing unknown. Use promised lead time (default) and default demand/volatility aggregation so OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample set; this balances service level against holding cost without overreacting to a single missed arrival.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). On-hand=0, in-transit=1601 (orders placed Periods 1\u20132). Past demand samples = [694,576,685,715,774], mean \u2248688.8. Promised lead time=4 and no concluded arrivals yet (no evidence to change lead-time). Use default lead time and default demand/volatility calculations so OR backend uses (1+L)\xd7sample mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7sample std. This keeps policy aligned with provided statistics while accounting for the full review+lead horizon; holding vs profit (2 vs 1) will be balanced by backend's service-level math.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (2019-03-04). On-hand=0, in-transit=2383 which equals sum of past orders (808+793+782) \u2014 no concluded arrivals yet but this matches promised lead-time behavior (L=4). Historical sample demands = [694,576,685,715,774], mean ~688.8, no clear changepoint or seasonality signal in available data. Use promised lead time and default demand estimators so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std; this balances service level (protects against demand variability over the 5-period coverage) while avoiding premature upward adjustments given no arrival failures observed.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/11 (Period 5). Demand samples = [694,576,685,715,774] (mean \u2248 688). On-hand=0, in-transit=3173 but no concluded arrivals in Periods 1\u20134 (all arrived=0 for orders placed), indicating actual lead time > promised 4 or lost shipments. To be conservative and avoid stockouts while backend still uses promised L=4 internally, I set L explicit longer to reflect observed delays. I leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as default (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using the chosen L) so forecasts scale with the longer lead+review period and volatility is preserved. This increases target base-stock to cover extended lead time and balances service vs holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

Carry-over insight: Observed prolonged arrival delays: orders from Periods 1\u20134 (ordered 808,793,782,790) all show arrived=0 in their conclude messages \u2192 implied actual lead time >4 or lost shipments; treat as sustained delay until we observe arrivals.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent concluded history shows one confirmed arrival: Period1 order arrived in Period5 \u2192 observed lead_time=4. Periods 2\u20134 remain unarrived (prolonged delays/loss risk) but we have one concrete lead-time observation, so use observed average. Demand history (samples [694,576,685,715,774]) mean ~689; stick with default demand aggregation to avoid overfitting given limited data and a potential transient disruption. Choose L by 'calculate' to reflect observed lead time=4, mu_hat default to let OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean across all samples, and sigma_hat default to let backend compute sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This balances service (use measured lead time) against holding cost while acknowledging in-transit stock is high (3,174) and one large arrival just replenished on-hand to 340.

Carry-over insight: Sustained arrival delay: orders placed in Periods 2\u20134 have not concluded (arrived=0) while Period1 concluded with lead_time=4; treat as ongoing delay/loss risk until those orders conclude.

Daily Reward (R_t): $373.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). Recent concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=4 (Period5: arrival of Period1, Period6: arrival of Period2). On-hand=631, in-transit=2381 (outstanding orders from recent periods exist and some arrived this run). Given two confirmed lead-time observations of 4, set L to the calculated average of observed lead times (=4). Use default demand aggregation for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples (keeps forecast anchored to full historical samples: mean demand=688.8, (1+L)=5). This balances service (observed LT=4) against holding cost while acknowledging remaining in-transit inventory.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time regime confirmed at 4 periods based on conclude messages: Period5 arrived order from Period1 (lead_time=4); Period6 arrived order from Period2 (lead_time=4). Treat LT=4 as current regime until future concludes contradict it.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). On-hand=902, in-transit=1760. Concluded arrivals in Periods 5\u20137 show orders from Periods 1\u20133 landed with lead_time=4 (consistent regime). No new evidence of lost shipments; pipeline plus on-hand currently covers multiple periods of demand. I therefore use the promised/observed LT regime and rely on full-sample demand stats: set L to default (promised 4), mu_hat default to let backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples, and sigma_hat default to let backend compute sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples. This keeps parameters aligned with confirmed LT=4 and uses the full historical demand sample to balance fill-rate vs holding cost given current healthy pipeline.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). Recent concluded history confirms actual lead time = 4 (arrivals in Periods 5\u20138 correspond to orders in Periods 1\u20134 with LT=4). Demand samples (past demands) have mean \u2248688.8. Current inventory: on-hand=1132, in-transit=1437 \u2192 total pipeline=2569, which is below (1+L)*mean demand (5\xd7688.8\u22483444), so we need replenishment. Given confirmed LT=4 and stable historical demand (no recent changepoint), use default estimators so the OR backend computes base-stock from full-sample mean and std. This balances service level (covers 5-period demand) against holding cost and leverages the backend cap. Carry-over delay/loss risk is noted but LT=4 is currently confirmed by conclues.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). Recent concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4 (Periods 5\u20139 arrivals correspond to orders from Periods 1\u20135 with W=4), so actual lead-time regime is 4. Historical demand samples = [694,576,685,715,774], mean=688.8; on-hand=1606, in-transit=1167 (pipeline substantial vs recent demands). To mirror the confirmed LT and use full-sample demand statistics, I select default methods so the OR engine uses promised L=4 and full-sample mean/variance across the (1+L) review+lead horizon. This is conservative given prior prolonged delays now resolved (arrivals observed at LT=4) and keeps service level high while letting the OR backend cap ordering to limit excess holding cost.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================

Period 11 (2019/04/22). On-hand=1337, in-transit=1425. Historical demands samples = [694,576,685,715,774] (mean=688.8). Recent conclude messages confirm actual lead time regime = 4 periods (arrivals from Periods 1\u20134 concluded with lead_time=4). No evidence of a new demand regime; use population estimates to cover review+lead horizon (1+L). Choose L=default (promised lead time=4) to align OR backend with observed regime. Use mu_hat=default to set (1+L)\xd7mean of samples (captures expected demand over review+lead). Use sigma_hat=default to reflect historical demand volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances service (profit>$2 vs holding $1) by sizing base stock to cover 5 periods of expected demand while letting OR cap limit per-period orders.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). Recent concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 (Period5 arrival from P1, Period6 arrival from P2, etc.), and on-hand=1237 + in-transit=1448 provides ample coverage vs. typical demand. Use promised/default lead time (4) consistent with observed regime. Demand history (samples [694,576,685,715,774]) mean ~688.8; using default mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and scaled volatility, balancing service level (profit $2 vs holding $1) while avoiding unnecessary explicit increases given healthy on-hand + pipeline.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). Recent concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4 (Period5 arrival from P1, Period6 arrival from P2, etc.), so treat actual LT=4. On-hand=1365, in-transit=1161 \u2014 pipeline ample vs recent weekly demands (historical samples mean=688.8); profit=2, holding=1 implies service-focus but avoid excess holding. Use default lead time (promised=4) and default demand estimates to let OR backend compute base_stock = (1+L)*mean and volatility from full sample; this balances service level given confirmed LT and available pipeline while letting capped order cap limit excessive ordering if pipeline already large.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time regime confirmed at 4 periods (evidence: Period5 concluded arrival from Period1 with lead_time=4; Period6 concluded arrival from Period2 with lead_time=4). Treat LT=4 as current regime until future concludes contradict it.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13 (Period 14). Recent conclude history consistently shows actual lead time = 4 periods (arrivals from Periods 1\u20139 concluded with W=4). On-hand=1663, in-transit=904; demand history samples = [694,576,685,715,774]. No new evidence of lost shipments or LT change\u2014use promised/default lead time to align with confirmed regime and let OR backend compute base_stock from full-sample mean/variance. Methods chosen: L=default to keep promised 4 (confirmed by concludes); mu_hat=default to use (1+L)*mean(all samples) so forecast reflects full-sample average demand over review+lead period; sigma_hat=default to use sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples) so safety buffer reflects observed variability. This balances service level (protects against demand over the 5-period horizon) versus holding cost given ample on-hand inventory and in-transit pipeline.

Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 (arrivals from Periods 1\u201313 confirm LT=4), so use promised/default lead time. Demand history (samples [694,576,685,715,774]) shows no recent changepoint in mean/variance, so use full-sample defaults for demand and volatility; backend will compute mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). On-hand=1188, in-transit=908. Historical concluded arrivals consistently indicate actual lead time = 4 (multiple arrivals show lead_time=4); no evidence of new lost shipments. Demand seed samples (given history) show a stable mean. I set L to default (use promised/confirmed lead time=4) and mu_hat/sigma_hat to default so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7sample mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7sample std automatically. This ensures the base-stock covers L+1 periods of demand (protecting service) while the backend cap limits order size to control holding cost exposure.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). On-hand=1019, in-transit=1165. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 (multiple concluded arrivals with lead_time=4), and earlier prolonged delays resolved into a stable LT=4 regime. To be conservative and align with observed regime and backend assumptions, use default lead time (promised=4) and default demand/volatility calculations so OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from historical samples. This keeps parameters consistent with observed LT=4, ensures pipeline covers (L+1) periods of demand, and lets the OR engine balance service level vs holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). Recent concluded history consistently shows actual lead time = 4 periods; demand samples show high weekly demand (historical samples ~694,576,685,715,774 and recent sells ~400\u2013560). Current inventory: on-hand=727, in-transit=1432 -> pipeline + on-hand = 2159 units. With L=4, (L+1)-period cover needed; pipeline appears healthy but some past orders were delayed before settle \u2014 recent concludes confirm LT=4 and no persistent losses now. I choose default lead time to match promised (and confirmed) LT=4 so OR backend uses promised value; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting the OR engine produce the base stock while respecting its cap. This is conservative: relies on confirmed LT and full-sample demand stats to balance service level vs holding cost given high demand and substantial pipeline.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=483, in-transit=1770 \u2014 pipeline + on-hand comfortably covers multiple weeks of demand given past weekly demands (~~ 576 mean from seed samples). No evidence of lost shipments currently; use promised/default lead time and default demand aggregation so OR backend uses full-sample mean/variance across (1+L) review+lead horizon. This keeps policy stable: base_stock computed from full-sample mean and variance with q derived from Profit=$2 / (Profit+Holding=$1) to balance service level vs holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-30.00

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). Recent conclude history shows consistent arrivals with lead_time=4 (multiple orders from Periods 1-16 concluded with W=4), so actual LT regime=4. On-hand=560, in-transit=1757. I set L to be calculated from observed concludes to lock in the confirmed LT=4. I leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR backend uses the full-sample demand stats scaled by (1+L); this is conservative given mixed recent demand but preserves service vs. holding tradeoff while we continue observing concludes for any LT shifts.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time regime confirmed at 4 periods based on conclude messages (evidence: multiple concluded arrivals showing lead_time=4, e.g., Period5 arrived from Period1 W=4; Period6 arrived from Period2 W=4; subsequent concludes through Period20 consistently show W=4). Treat LT=4 as current regime until future concludes contradict it.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019-07-15). Recent conclude history consistently shows actual lead_time = 4 (multiple concluded arrivals with W=4), so use the promised/confirmed LT regime. Demand samples (past demands [694,576,685,715,774]) have mean 688.8; with L=4 the review+lead horizon is 5 periods. On-hand=790 and in-transit=1333 provide strong pipeline cover vs typical 5-period demand (sum of samples=3444). To keep the OR engine aligned with observed LT and full-sample demand statistics, set L=default (promised 4), mu_hat=default ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples), sigma_hat=default (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples). This keeps service-level targets consistent with observed lead-time stability while avoiding overreacting to short-term noise or transient missing arrivals.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22). Demand history shows mean \u2248688.8 (samples [694,576,685,715,774]). Multiple conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 4 periods; use promised/default LT to match regime. On-hand=873 + in-transit=1257 = 2130 units (still below (1+L)*mean=5*688.8=3444 but inventory is substantial vs. single-period demand). To let the OR engine balance service level vs holding cost given stable historical samples and confirmed LT=4, use default demand and volatility estimates so backend computes base_stock and cap with full-sample stats.

LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). SKU 706016001 (jeans). Profit=$2, Holding=$1. On-hand=970, In-transit=1277. Historical concluded arrivals consistently imply actual lead time = 4 periods; no recent lost-shipment signal. Use promised/default lead time to align with observed regime. Use default demand/volatility aggregation so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from available samples; this balances service (higher base stock via (1+L) multiplier) against holding cost given moderate on-hand + pipeline.

On-hand=896 and in-transit=1248 provides healthy coverage versus typical weekly demand samples. Use default demand/volatility aggregation so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from historical samples, which balances service level (profit>holding) while avoiding excess holding given ample pipeline.

Historical sample mean demand \u2248 688.8 (samples provided). Current inventory: on-hand=843, in-transit=1191 \u2192 pipeline=2034.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=726, in-transit=1182 \u2192 total pipeline 1908, which comfortably covers (1+L) periods of expected demand under L=4. Use default lead time to match promised/current regime (L=4). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from available demand samples; this leverages all historical demand data and keeps estimates stable given no clear recent demand regime shift.

Promised lead time = 4 and confirmed by history, so use default lead time. Use default demand/volatility sizing ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of samples) to let the OR engine compute base-stock and cap; this balances service level (maintain coverage for L+1 periods) against holding cost given current high pipeline.

Concluded arrivals across history consistently show actual lead_time=4 (multiple concluded arrivals from Periods 1\u201329 with W=4), so use the promised/default LT. Pipeline is large relative to recent demand \u2014 avoid inflating forecasts. I choose default methods so the OR engine uses L=promised and population demand stats to compute (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility; this prevents over-ordering given substantial in-transit inventory and leverages the confirmed LT=4 regime.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). Demand context: recent observed demand samples seed = [694,576,685,715,774]; product is seasonal apparel but no immediate calendar spike. Concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple concluded arrivals with W=4 through Period 30). On-hand = 0, in-transit = 1678 \u2014 pipeline appears large and consistent with LT=4. I therefore use default lead time (promised 4) and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this keeps the policy conservative given high in-transit stock and avoids overreacting to noise or presumed lost shipments.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16): on-hand=0, in-transit=2032. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 (arrivals from Periods 1\u21925, 2\u21926, etc. through recent periods), so treat LT regime as 4. Given stable LT and limited demand sample set seeded in system, use default methods so OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from available samples; this balances service level vs holding cost while respecting confirmed lead time and existing pipeline. No explicit increase in mu_hat or sigma_hat\u2014let backend update using full sample history.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time regime confirmed at 4 periods (evidence: concluded arrivals showing lead_time=4 repeatedly, e.g., Period5 arrived from Period1 W=4; Period6 arrived from Period2 W=4; pattern consistent through subsequent concludes).

LLM Rationale:

Recent demand has been high and variable (multiple weeks of ~700+ units). To keep the OR backend aligned with observed regime and avoid understock while leveraging its statistical calibration, use default lead time (promised=4) and default demand/volatility calculations so the backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples). This keeps policy consistent with the confirmed LT=4 regime and lets the OR engine balance service level vs holding cost using observed sample stats.

Concluded arrivals through Period 33 consistently show actual lead time = 4 (multiple concluded arrivals with W=4), so use the promised/default lead time. No new sustained changepoints in demand or lead time beyond the established LT=4 regime. I select L=default to keep lead time = 4 (backend uses promised LT). I select mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the full historical samples\u2014this is conservative given confirmed LT=4 and avoids overreacting to recent spikes while letting the backend cap orders per its policy to balance service level versus holding cost.

Historical seed demand samples are limited and no clear recent demand regime shift is evident. Use default lead time (promised) which equals observed regime, and default demand/volatility calculations so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this keeps parameters aligned with observed LT=4 and avoids overfitting to short-term noise while letting the backend set the base-stock tradeoff between profit and holding cost.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead_time=4 (stable regime). Recent observed demand samples mean=688.8 (samples provided). On-hand=0, in-transit=2180 which is below (1+L)*mean demand (5\xd7688.8=3444) so pipeline is currently short of cover for L+1 periods; no evidence of new lost shipments. Use promised/default lead time so OR backend assumes L=4 and computes base-stock from full-sample mean/variance; this yields conservative replenishment because mu_hat default=(1+L)\xd7mean captures the 5-period demand and sigma_hat default scales volatility by sqrt(1+L). These settings prompt the OR engine to replenish toward a 5-period cover, addressing the current pipeline shortfall while balancing profit vs. holding cost.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). Inventory on-hand=0, in-transit=2212. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple concluded arrivals with W=4 across Periods 5\u201337). Several earlier prolonged delays resolved into a stable LT=4 regime. To maintain service while controlling holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1, use the backend defaults so it computes base-stock from full-sample mean and variance with promised lead time=4. Default settings are appropriate because observed lead time equals the promised LT and demand regime shows no recent, sustained mean shift requiring manual override. This balances fill-rate (via base-stock) vs holding cost while relying on OR engine's capped ordering.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). Recent conclude history consistently shows actual lead_time = 4 periods; I therefore use the promised/default lead time. Historical sample mean (given samples [694,576,685,715,774]) = 688.8 units; (1+L)=5 so 5-period demand \u2248 3,444 units. Current position: on-hand=0, in-transit=2,149 \u2192 pipeline shortfall \u2248 1,295 units vs expected 5-period demand, so we must rely on OR backend base-stock sizing to replenish while avoiding excess holding. Choose default demand and volatility methods so the OR engine uses full-sample estimates and the capped ordering cap to limit single-period overshipments given observed pipeline variability and occasional lost shipments in earlier history.

To remain aligned with observed regime and avoid introducing unwarranted volatility adjustments, use promised/default lead time and default demand estimates so OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over the sample history. This keeps orders sized to cover the review+lead horizon while the pipeline (2358) is consumed.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). Recent conclude history consistently shows actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple concluded arrivals with W=4); treat LT=4 as current regime. On-hand=36, in-transit=2154 \u2014 large pipeline covers multiple weeks of demand, no immediate shortage risk but holding cost penalizes excess stock. Demand samples (seeded by provided past demands) show moderate variability. Use default lead time to match promised/observed regime and let OR backend compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples so the engine balances service level vs holding cost given the high pipeline.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=54, in-transit=2175. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple concluded arrivals with W=4); pipeline appears healthy but demand has recent high variance with several stockouts earlier this season. I therefore use the promised/default lead time and let the OR engine compute mu_hat and sigma_hat from the full sample history ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the backend can apply its capped base-stock policy. This avoids overfitting to short-term swings while preserving service level given current large pipeline.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=2176. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead_time=4 (multiple concluded arrivals through Period 42 with W=4). Given stable LT=4 and available past demand samples, use default statistical aggregation so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This keeps parameters aligned with observed LT regime and lets the OR engine set base-stock to balance the $2 profit vs $1 holding cost while accounting for the 5-period coverage requirement (current + L).

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time regime = 4 periods confirmed by concluded arrivals through Period 42 (multiple orders show lead_time=4); treat LT=4 as current regime until future concludes contradict it.

Historical demands [694,576,685,715,774] and long history of concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods; no evidence of a new regime or lost shipments since recent concludes. To be conservative and let the OR engine use full-sample statistics (matching observed LT=promised 4), use default lead time and default demand estimates so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service level (consistent LT=4) against holding cost given modest profit vs holding cost ratio.

Demand samples seed available; no recent changepoint in mean/variance that warrants downweighting. Using default methods (backend will apply (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) keeps estimates stable and lets the OR engine compute the service-level-aware base-stock balancing profit ($2) vs holding cost ($1). This also avoids overreacting to inventory-in-transit whose arrivals already follow LT=4.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019-12-23). Demand context: recent historical sample mean ~689 (samples provided) with occasional large spikes in the log but overall stable; concluded lead-time repeatedly = 4 periods in history so treat LT=4. Current inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=2692. Pipeline is substantial but will not be visible until arrivals conclude in future periods; continue assuming on-time arrivals. To balance service vs holding cost I use the backend defaults: promised lead time (L=4) and default demand/volatility aggregation so the OR engine computes base-stock from full-sample mean and std over the (1+L) review+lead horizon. This keeps the policy simple and aligned with confirmed LT=4 while letting the OR engine apply caps to limit excessive orders given holding cost.

On-hand=74 + in-transit=2733 gives ample cover for multiple periods; use default lead time so OR backend uses promised LT=4 (matches observed regime). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this leverages the full history and lets the capped ordering rule limit replenishment given large pipeline, avoiding excess holding cost while preserving service given confirmed LT=4.
