Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. SKU 706016001 has zero on-hand and zero in-transit; no concluded arrivals yet. Historical weekly demands = [694,576,685,715,774] show stable high demand (mean \u2248 688). Promised lead time = 4 periods and no evidence of alternative lead-time regime or lost shipments in conclude history, so retain promised lead time and use full-sample demand estimates. Use default methods so OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std, balancing service level (high mean demand) against holding cost.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/2/18 (Period 2). On-hand=0, in-transit=808 (ordered in Period 1) but Period 1 conclude shows arrived=0 -> shipment has not yet concluded; may be delayed but not enough evidence to change promised lead time. Historical demand samples = [694,576,685,715,774], mean=688.8. Promised lead time is 4 periods; do not infer shorter/longer actual L from a single non-arrival. Use default methods so OR backend uses promised L and full-sample demand stats: this keeps mu_hat tied to long-run mean (protects service level given high recent demand) while sigma_hat default preserves measured volatility. This balances service (avoid stockouts) vs holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1 by letting the OR backend compute z from q and apply capped ordering.

Carry-over insight: Ordered 808 in Period 1 still in-transit and not concluded (Period 1 conclude arrived=0) \u2014 monitor for delay or lost shipment.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). Recent demands are stable (samples: [694,576,685,715,774], mean=688.8). On-hand=0, in-transit=1601 from prior orders (periods 1&2) but both concluded arrived=0 \u2192 possible delay or lost shipments; no concluded arrivals to estimate actual lead time. Use promised lead time (default) to avoid overreacting to unconfirmed delays. Set demand estimates to population defaults so OR backend calculates base-stock from full-sample mean and variance ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std), providing service coverage for current plus L periods while keeping holding exposure governed by profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04 (Period 4). Recent demand samples show mean \u2248 689 (historical samples [694,576,685,715,774]); recent concluded demands in Periods1-3 were 671, 673, 539. On-hand=0, in-transit=2383 which equals orders placed in Periods1-3 (808+793+782). Those shipments have not concluded yet but are still within the promised 4-period lead time (no overdue/lost evidence). Use default lead time (promised L=4) so the OR engine assumes promised L; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample set\u2014this leverages the stable historical mean while the pipeline covers upcoming demand and avoids overreacting to short-term noise.

Carry-over insight: All three orders placed in Periods 1-3 remain in-transit (808, 793, 782; total 2383) and have not yet concluded; currently still within promised 4-period lead time\u2014monitor for late arrival/loss if they fail to conclude by their expected conclude periods.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). On-hand=0, In-transit=3173 (orders from Periods 1-4: 808,793,782,790) \u2014 none have concluded yet but remain within the promised 4-period lead time. Use promised lead time (default) because no concluded arrivals exist to revise actual L. Demand history available; no strong changepoint confirmed. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level against holding cost while awaiting arrival confirmations.

Carry-over insight: Orders from Periods 1-4 (808,793,782,790; total 3173) remain in-transit and unconcluded\u2014monitor for late arrival or lost shipment if they fail to conclude by their expected conclude periods.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18): on-hand=340, in-transit=2498 (orders from P2-P4,P6 still unconcluded). We have one concluded lead-time observation: Period1 order arrived in Period5 => observed lead_time=4. Remaining in-transit orders are still within promised lead time but must be monitored for loss if they fail to conclude. I set L method to "calculate" so backend uses observed lead times (avg=4) rather than blind promise. Demand forecasting uses defaults: mu_hat and sigma_hat set to "default" so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all historical samples, giving a balanced base-stock target that accounts for the 5-period coverage (current period + 4-period lead time) while limiting inventory risk given holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (Period1 order concluded in Period5); continue monitoring outstanding in-transit orders for late arrival or loss.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). Recent concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=4 (Period1 and Period2 arrivals confirmed L=4). Demand history samples: [694,576,685,715,774]. Current inventory: on-hand=631, in-transit=2095 (covers several future periods). Risk: outstanding in-transit should be monitored for any lost shipments but two 4-period arrivals give confidence in L=4. Set L via calculate to use observed lead times. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level given profit/holding costs and current healthy pipeline.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date=2019-04-01 (Period 8). Recent on-hand=902, in-transit=1760. Historical demand samples (seed): [694,576,685,715,774]. Recent observed concluded demands (Periods1-7) show a downward shift vs seed (periods 5-7 ~468\u2013511), indicating lower recent weekly demand. Lead-time evidence: concluded arrivals show lead_time=4 for orders placed in Periods 1-3 (confirmed actual LT=4). Given confirmed LT=4 and a modest decline in demand, I choose to: (1) let backend compute L from observed lead times (calculate) to capture confirmed LT=4; (2) use a recent_N forecast for mu_hat to weight recent lower demand (N=5 gives a balance between seed and recent periods); (3) keep sigma_hat as default so backend uses full-sample volatility scaled by (1+L). This combination keeps the order-up-to tuned to the confirmed 4-period lead time while reducing target inventory to reflect lower recent demand, lowering holding costs while maintaining service level.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08 (Period 9). Demand history shows stable weekly demands; on-hand=1132, in-transit=970. Concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (Period1->Period5, Period2->6, Period3->7, Period4->8). Use lead-time inference via observed average to capture true L. Use default demand aggregation (backend: (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and default volatility to let OR engine compute base-stock from full-sample mean/std; this balances service (capturing confirmed L=4) versus holding cost given moderate on-hand inventory and confirmed timely arrivals.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). Recent demand history shows mean demand \u2248689 (historical samples [694,576,685,715,774]) with more recent periods trending lower (~400-560). Concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4 periods (Period1-4 orders each concluded with W=4). Current on-hand=930, in-transit=1613 (total pipeline=2543) which is below (1+L)*mean demand \u22483444 for L=4, indicating potential shortfall if demand returns to historical mean. Use inferred actual lead time (calculate) so OR backend aligns ordering horizon; keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default (use all samples) to avoid overfitting to short recent dip while the backend balances service vs holding cost.

Use L calculated from observed lead times to capture confirmed regime (calculate -> 4). Demand history samples [694,576,685,715,774] show stable mean; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR backend computes base-stock using all available demand history. This keeps forecast anchored to observed demand while the calculated L ensures pipeline coverage for the 4-period lead time and addresses prior delayed arrivals.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). Recent demand samples mean=688.8 units/week (samples: [694,576,685,715,774]); observed concluded lead times have been consistently 4 periods. On-hand=898 + in-transit=1628 => pipeline=2526, which is below the (1+L)*mean target (5*688.8=3444), so we remain short of the desired coverage for review+lead horizon. Choose L by averaging observed lead times to reflect actual behavior; use default demand/volatility aggregation so the OR engine computes base-stock from the full-sample mean and std, which balances service level vs holding cost given stable historical demand and confirmed 4-period lead time. This approach also lets the OR backend cap ordering appropriately while we monitor for any lost shipments.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). Recent demand samples mean \u2248689 (past five periods). Observed concluded lead-times are consistently 4 periods \u2192 use calculated lead time to reflect reality. On-hand 1,433 + in-transit 1,134 = 2,567 units vs. (1+L)*mean \u22483,444 \u2192 current pipeline likely short of target coverage for review+lead period, so keep mu_hat tied to full (1+L) demand to drive replenishment. Use default sigma to reflect historical variability. Methods chosen: L by calculate (avg observed lead times = 4), mu_hat default ((1+L)\xd7mean of samples) and sigma_hat default (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std).

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). Demand context: SKU is seasonal apparel (jeans) with stable historical samples [694,576,685,715,774] and recent per-period demands in history showing typical weekly demand ~240\u2013560 after arrivals. On-hand=1019, in-transit=1165. Concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple concluded messages: orders placed in Periods 1\u201313 concluded with lead_time=4). Several earlier periods showed temporarily zero arrivals while still within promised window, but all subsequent concludes confirm L=4 rather than lost shipments. Recommendation: rely on observed lead-time regime (L=4) and use default demand estimates across the review+lead horizon to let the OR engine compute base stock; this balances service (profit=$2 vs holding=$1) while avoiding aggressive overstock given current large on-hand and pipeline. No new carry-over insights beyond confirmed 4-period lead time.

Multiple concluded messages consistently show lead_time = 4 periods, so use observed lead time. Use conservative, simple defaults so OR backend computes base stock from full-sample mean and variance: keep L set from observed lead times and let mu_hat/sigma_hat use default aggregation ((1+L)\xd7mean, sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This balances service (large pipeline + confirmed L=4) against holding cost without introducing ad-hoc manual adjustments.

Historical concluded messages consistently show lead_time=4 periods for multiple orders (Period1\u2192arrived in Period5, Period2\u2192Period6, etc.), so I set L based on observed lead times. Demand seed samples = [694,576,685,715,774] give mean \u2248688.8; with no clear recent demand regime shift and no persistent variance change, use default demand/volatility aggregations.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29 (Period 25). Recent concluded history shows consistent actual lead time = 4 periods and steady demand; on-hand=970, in-transit=1277. Use promised/default lead time to match observed stable 4-period regime. Use default demand sizing ((1+L)\xd7mean of available samples) and default volatility so the OR engine applies the standard base-stock calculation and cap while accounting for observed variability. This keeps service high given positive profit/holding ratio and avoids aggressive excess inventory since on-hand + pipeline already substantial.

Demand samples and recent sales remain steady. Use promised/default lead time so OR uses L=4. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples \u2014 this provides a higher service target consistent with profit/holding tradeoff (profit=$2, holding=$1) while avoiding manual overreaction to short-term noise.

LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=643, in-transit=1331. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4 periods (Period5 onward arrivals match orders placed 4 periods earlier) and recent pipeline shipments have been arriving on schedule. Some early delays were resolved and lead time appears stable at 4. To avoid overfitting to short-term noise and because promised lead time equals observed, I use default lead time and default demand statistics so the OR engine computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples. This keeps targets aligned with long-run demand while the pipeline (in-transit + on-hand) covers multi-period demand and guards against intermittent lost shipments.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). Recent concluded history shows consistent lead_time=4 (all concluded arrivals from Periods 5\u201330 indicate 4 periods). Demand has been volatile with last 5 samples [694,576,685,715,774] (mean ~688) and recent large spike in Period 30 demand (740) that exhausted on-hand. In-transit=1678 covers ~2.4 periods at recent mean\u2014still short of (L+1) coverage. No evidence of lost shipments since arrivals have consistently concluded at 4 periods. Use default lead time (promised L=4) so OR backend uses stable observed lead time; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history, allowing the engine to target the profit/holding tradeoff automatically.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019/9/23). Recent demand has been high and variable (multiple weeks with ~400\u2013740 units sold; earlier seed samples [694,576,685,715,774]). On-hand = 0, in-transit = 1978 \u2014 pipeline covers roughly 4+ periods of recent demand but arrivals are delayed previously; actual lead time has been confirmed at 4 periods historically. I select L = default (use promised 4) because concluded history consistently shows 4-period arrivals and the OR engine expects promised lead time. For demand parameters I choose default mu_hat and default sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples \u2014 this leverages full historical demand to produce base-stock and the capped order. Continue monitoring outstanding in-transit for late/lost shipments; if future concludes show missing arrivals, switch to explicit/recent_N lead-time handling.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30). On-hand=0, in-transit=2084. Historical concludes show consistent realized lead_time=4 periods (orders repeatedly concluded with W=4); prior temporary delays resolved. Recent weeks show severe stockouts and a demand spike (Period 33 demand=1428) but overall historical sampling supports using the promised lead time and population stats. Use default lead time (promised=4) so OR backend applies observed long-run statistics; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. Continue monitoring outstanding in-transit for any lost shipments and watch recent demand spike for possible regime change.

Carry-over insight: Recent demand surge: Periods 30-33 show elevated demand with a large spike in Period 33 (1428 units) and repeated stockouts thereafter \u2014 suggests a possible upward demand regime starting ~Period 30; monitor for persistence and consider shifting to recent_N or EWMA if spike persists.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019/10/7). On-hand=0, in-transit=2309. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 4 periods (no evidence to change). Recent demand spike began ~Period 30 (large spikes and repeated stockouts through Periods 30\u201334), so use a recent-window forecast to capture elevated mean and variance. Set L=default to rely on promised lead time (confirmed by history). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to make the base-stock reflect the new higher-demand regime while keeping volatility estimate aligned with recent variability. This balances service (reduce stockouts from the surge) against holding cost by limiting adjustments to a short recent window.

Carry-over insight: New sustained demand upshift starting ~Period 30 (Periods 30\u201333 showed elevated demand, e.g., Period 33=1428 with repeated stockouts thereafter); confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods from concluded history.

Historical concluded arrivals show a consistent 4-period actual lead time; recent demand regime shift beginning ~Period 30 (repeated stockouts, spike Period 33=1428, elevated demands Periods 30\u201335) persists. To capture the new higher-demand regime I set L by averaging observed lead times (captures confirmed L=4) and set demand forecasts using the recent regime (recent_N with N=6 covering Periods 30\u201335) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend will target a higher base-stock and wider safety stock to reduce stockouts while limiting excess hold given holding cost=$1 and profit=$2.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21 (Period 37). On-hand=0, in-transit=3845. Historical concluded lead times consistently =4 periods; promised L=4 matches observed \u2014 use default L. Demand shows a clear upshift from Period 30 onward (Periods 30\u201336: 740,708,707,1428,748,606,581 \u2014 repeated stockouts and a large spike in Period 33). I treat this as a new higher-demand regime and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the regime. Regime length = 7 (Periods 30\u201336) \u2192 choose N=7 to capture current mean and volatility over the review+lead window. This increases the base-stock target to better cover elevated demand while sigma_hat recent_N raises safety stock to reduce stockouts given confirmed L=4 and expensive lost sales relative to holding cost (profit=2, holding=1).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=0, in-transit=3688. Historical concludes show a clear actual lead time of 4 periods (orders consistently concluded after 4). Demand regime shifted up starting ~Period 30 (large spike Period 33 and repeated stockouts through Period 37). I keep L as promised/default since concluded history confirms L=4. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N with N=8 (Periods 30\u201337) to capture the new higher-demand regime while avoiding dilution by older low-demand data. This raises target base-stock to improve service during the sustained upshift; using recent volatility (sigma recent_N) tightens the forecasted uncertainty around the new regime. Monitoring: outstanding in-transit volume (3688) must be treated as arriving per L=4; if expected concludes fail to appear in future concludes, switch L to explicit longer or flag lost shipments.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/04 (Period 39). On-hand=0, in-transit=3503. Historical concluded lead times consistently =4 periods (use promised lead time). Demand shows a clear upshift starting ~Period 30 (periods 30\u201338 demands: 740,708,707,1428,748,606,581,643,663) \u2014 regime length = 9. To capture the recent higher mean and volatility I use recent_N with N=9 for both demand mean and std (mu_hat and sigma_hat). Keeping L=default (promised 4) aligns OR backend with observed lead time while using recent_N demand inputs helps the optimizer raise base-stock to reduce stockouts during the new higher-demand regime.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/11 (Period 40). On-hand=899, in-transit=2656. Historical concluded lead times consistently =4 periods (use promised/default). Recent demand regime shows elevated demand since ~Period 30 with repeated stockouts; use a recent_N demand estimate to capture the higher mean over the most recent periods (reduces stockout risk). Keep sigma_hat as default to let backend scale volatility with L. These choices raise target base-stock to balance profit ($2) vs holding ($1) given observed demand surge and confirmed L=4.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand upshift beginning ~Period 30 (Periods 30\u201333 large spike and persistent higher demand thereafter); actual lead time confirmed = 4 periods from concluded history.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18): confirmed actual lead time = 4 from concluded history; recent sustained demand upshift beginning ~Period 30 (higher weekly demand and repeated stockouts through Periods 30\u201338, then elevated arrivals and continued higher sales). On-hand=1635 + in-transit=1339 gives pipeline coverage; still target service while containing holding cost. Set L to default (promised lead time = 4). For demand, use recent_N over the post-changepoint regime to capture the higher mean/volatility: regime length \u2248 Periods 30\u201340 (11 samples), so choose N=11 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to make base_stock responsive to the new higher-demand regime while sigma reflects recent volatility.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/25 (Period 42). Recent history shows a clear demand upshift beginning ~Period 30 (large spike Period 33=1428 and repeated stockouts through Periods 30\u201334, then persistently higher weekly demand). On-hand=1464, in-transit=1815; promised lead time=4 and concluded history confirms actual lead time = 4. To capture the post-changepoint demand regime I use recent_N for demand mean and volatility using the most recent regime (~Period 30 onward). This increases forecast responsiveness while keeping L at the promised/default (backed by concluded lead-time=4). Using N=12 balances recency with sample size (Periods 30\u201341 included) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the new higher demand and observed variability, helping the OR backend raise base_stock to avoid stockouts while the capped order constraint limits extreme orders and controls holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand upshift beginning ~Period 30 (Periods 30\u201333 spike, Period 33=1428, repeated stockouts thereafter); confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods from concluded history.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). On-hand=0, in-transit=1859. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods. Demand regime shifted upward starting ~Period 30 (large spike Period 33=1428 and persistent higher demands / repeated stockouts thereafter). I therefore keep L at promised/default (4) and model demand using recent data to capture the new higher-demand regime. Chose mu_hat recent_N and sigma_hat recent_N with N=13 to cover the post-changepoint window (Periods ~30\u201342) so the OR engine's base-stock reflects the elevated mean and volatility; this helps raise target inventory to avoid stockouts while keeping cap constraints to limit excess holding given $1/unit holding cost. Monitoring outstanding in-transit shipments continues but concluded history supports L=4.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand upshift beginning ~Period 30 (evidence: Period 30\u201333 elevated demands with Period 33=1428 and persistent higher demand / repeated stockouts through Period 42); actual lead time confirmed = 4 periods from concluded arrivals.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-9): on-hand=0, in-transit=3368, historical concluded lead times consistently =4. Recent demand regime shows sustained upshift beginning ~Period 30 (higher demands and stockouts). Use promised lead time to match concluded history and avoid under-ordering. For demand forecast and volatility use recent_N to capture the new higher-demand regime (use last 14 concluded periods since regime ~Period 30 \u2192 length ~14), so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from those recent samples. This raises target base-stock to improve service during the elevated-demand regime while relying on backend cap to limit per-period order size.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/16 (Period 45). On-hand=0, in-transit=5015. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 periods repeatedly. Demand shows a sustained upshift beginning ~Period 30 (large spike Period 33 and Period 42 extreme), so recent demand regime (Periods 30\u201344) better represents current mean/volatility than full history. Set L to default (promised lead time = 4). Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=15 (Periods 30\u201344) to capture the new higher-demand regime and recent volatility; this increases target base-stock to protect service during the confirmed 4-period lead time while avoiding overstating variability from older low-demand periods.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand upshift beginning ~Period 30 (evidence: elevated demands Periods 30\u201333 including 1428 in P33, persistent higher demands and stockouts through P44); actual lead time confirmed = 4 periods from concluded arrivals.

Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 periods and a sustained demand upshift beginning ~Period 30 (large spike P33=1428 and persistent higher demand thereafter). To capture the new higher-demand regime, set L to default (promised lead time = 4) and use recent_N for demand estimates using the post-changepoint window (Periods 30\u201345, length=16) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility from the most relevant data. This balances higher service needs after the demand upshift while avoiding overreaction to older low-demand history; using recent_N for sigma captures elevated variability. Monitoring for overdue/lost shipments continues given large in-transit volume.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date=2019-12-30 (Period 47). Recent history shows a sustained demand upshift beginning ~Period 30 (large spike P33=1428 and persistent stockouts through P42\u2013P46). Actual lead time has repeatedly concluded at 4 periods. On-hand=190, in-transit=4182 \u2014 pipeline is large but demand has increased, so use a recent-window demand estimate to capture the new regime. Choose L=default to keep promised lead time=4 (confirmed historically). Select recent_N (N=17) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L) demand forecast and volatility on the most recent regime (Periods ~30\u201346, regime length \u224817), which balances responsiveness to the uplift while retaining enough samples to stabilize estimates. This increases service against stockouts while the OR backend will cap orders via its cap parameter.
