Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11; product = high-waisted skinny denim. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 and no concluded arrivals to infer lead-time changes. Use promised lead time (0). Demand history mean = 688.8; no recent changepoint or calendar event detected, so set mu_hat to (1+L)*mean. Compute sigma_hat from historical samples (std \u2248 71.99) scaled by sqrt(1+L). These parameters keep the OR engine aligned with historical demand while avoiding assumed lead-time or demand shifts.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent concluded arrival shows orders placed in Period 1 arrived with lead_time=0. On-hand=49, in-transit=0; last period sold 671. Historical demand samples = [694,576,685,715,774] mean=688.8, std\u224864.36. No evidence of demand regime shift or lost shipments. Use promised lead time (0) and default demand estimates to target a one-period base stock consistent with historical mean, balancing $2 profit vs $1 holding cost (service quantile ~0.666).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent concluded history shows promised lead time 0 and both observed lead times = 0. Demand history (samples [694,576,685,715,774]) has mean ~688.8 and std ~71.93. On-hand = 41, in-transit = 0; no overdue shipments observed. To supply the current period (L+1=1), use the full-sample demand estimates (conservative given no evidence of regime change). These parameters provide the OR engine a base-stock anchored to the long-run mean while reflecting observed variability, balancing service level (via sigma) against holding cost.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. SKU is seasonal denim; no calendar events. Historical demands stable (samples: [694,576,685,715,774], mean=688.8, std\u224864.36). All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 in prior periods (Periods 1\u20133), so no evidence of lead-time regime change or lost shipments. On-hand=171, in-transit=0 \u2014 modest stock but below mean demand; use promised lead time. Selected methods: L='default' (promised 0) so (1+L)=1; mu_hat default = mean of all samples \xd7(1+L)=688.8 to target average demand; sigma_hat default = std(all samples)\xd7sqrt(1+L)=64.36 to capture observed volatility. These settings balance service (cover typical demand) against holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1 (critical fractile q=2/(2+1)=0.6667, backend will convert to z).

Daily Reward (R_t): $642.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/11. Recent concluded history shows consistent same-period arrivals (lead_time=0 each conclude). Historical demand samples (provided) have mean 688.8 and sample std \u224872. On-hand=252, in-transit=0 so current coverage relies on on-hand only. I use promised lead time (default L=0) because concluded messages consistently show 0 lead time. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the full historical samples (default) to provide the OR engine with stable demand estimates: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean = 688.8 (covers current period demand); sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std \u2248 72 to reflect observed volatility. These parameters balance service level (uses full-sample mean) against holding cost given on-hand inventory and steady lead time.

Carry-over insight: Observed actual lead time = 0 periods in Periods 1-4 concludes (orders ordered on Period N arrived same period N); treat lead time regime as 0 until contradicted.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Lead time regime remains 0 (recent concludes show orders arriving same period). Current on-hand=218, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Historical demand samples (provided) have mean ~688.8 and elevated variability. Using promised L=0 and default historical moments keeps the OR engine's base-stock anchored to observed long-run demand while avoiding overreaction to recent downward drift in sales.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25. On-hand=170, in-transit=0. Historical demands [694,576,685,715,774] mean=688.8, std\u224864.36. All concluded arrivals (Periods 1\u20136) show lead_time=0 \u2014 treat lead-time regime as 0. Use default methods so OR backend applies base-stock using full-sample mean/volatility (no recent changepoint detected). This keeps orders responsive to observed same-period arrivals while balancing profit vs. holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime = 0 periods, evidenced by concluded arrivals in Periods 1\u20136 (orders on Periods 1\u20136 arrived same period).

Historical demand mean = 688.8 and std = 64.36 from samples [694,576,685,715,774]; with L=0 set mu_hat and sigma_hat to default ((1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std) to align the OR base-stock with observed demand while avoiding overreaction to short-term noise.

LLM Rationale:
Recent concluded history (Periods 1\u20138) shows consistent same-period arrivals \u2192 lead-time regime = 0. Recent demand has settled lower than earlier long-run samples; using the last 8 observed demands (Periods 1\u20138) captures current regime. Set L to promised/default (0). Set mu_hat using recent_N to target (1+L)*mean of last 8 demands = 546.375 to reflect current demand level. Set sigma_hat using recent_N (std of last 8 demands, sample std) = 85.44 to capture current volatility. These parameters keep base-stock aligned with recent demand and short lead time, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

On-hand=249, in-transit=0 \u2014 on-hand is well below one-period expected demand (~689) so parameters aim to pull inventory toward the base-stock computed by OR while respecting low holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $171.00

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Lead-time regime remains 0 (concluded arrivals Periods 1\u201310). Recent demand has softened (sharp drops in Periods 9\u201310: 335, 269) so I downweight older high-demand weeks and forecast from the most recent regime. Set L to promised (0). Use recent_N for demand/volatility using the last 5 periods (Periods 6\u201310) to capture the current lower-demand regime and elevated variance; this keeps pipeline small while preserving service.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime = 0 periods confirmed by concluded arrivals in Periods 1\u201310; Recent demand regime change: lower mean starting around Period 9, evidenced by demands 560\u2192335\u2192269 (use recent_N=5 for forecasting).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-04-29. Lead-time regime remains 0 periods (confirmed by concluded arrivals in Periods 1\u201311). Recent demand has dropped starting around Period 9; last 5 concluded demands = [511,560,335,269,261], mean=387.2, std\u2248124.74. I set L=default (promised 0) to reflect confirmed same-period arrivals. For demand I use recent_N=5 to capture the lower post-Period-9 regime: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last5)=387.2. For sigma_hat I use recent_N=5: sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(last5)=124.74. These choices keep the OR baseline lead time (so arrivals remain same-period) while lowering the forecast and uncertainty to reduce overstock given the sustained demand decline.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Lead time regime remains 0 (concluded arrivals in Periods 1\u201312). Demand has shifted down starting ~Period 9; recent 5 demands = [560,335,269,261,339], mean=352.8 and std\u2248108.54. I set L to promised (0). Use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the new lower-demand regime (mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_recent = 352.8). Use recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility (sigma_hat \u2248 108.54). These parameters bias orders toward lower forecasted demand while retaining safety stock for observed variability.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime = 0 periods confirmed by concluded arrivals in Periods 1\u201312; Recent demand regime shift to lower mean starting ~Period 9 (evidence: demands 560\u2192335\u2192269\u2192261\u2192339); use recent_N=5 for forecasting.

Daily Reward (R_t): $258.00

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent concluded history confirms lead-time regime = 0 (arrivals on Periods 1\u201314 arrived same period). Demand has shifted lower starting ~Period 9; last 5 concluded demands (Periods 10\u201314 = 269, 261, 339, 241, 189) give a recent mean of 259.8 and sample std \u2248 54.14. To respond to the lower-demand regime while keeping immediate availability (L=0), I set L to promised (0), use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the new lower mean, and recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These parameters produce a conservative base-stock tuned to the new demand level, reducing overstock risk while preserving service for current-period demand.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-06-03. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistent same-period arrivals (lead_time=0) through Period 16. Demand has shifted lower starting ~Period 9; last 5 period demands = [339,241,189,375,533], mean=335.4, std\u2248119.13. I set L to calculated average observed lead time (0) to reflect confirmed regime. I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the new lower-demand regime (mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_recent = 335.4). I use recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility (sigma_hat \u2248119.13). These settings keep base-stock focused on the lower recent demand while preserving enough safety stock for observed variability, minimizing holding cost given confirmed short lead time.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-06-24. Lead-time has been consistently 0 in concluded history (Periods 1\u201319). On-hand=101, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Recent demand regime shifted lower starting ~Period 9; last 5 demands = [375,533,451,462,358] (mean=435.8, std\u224863.43). To balance service vs holding cost (profit $2, hold $1), use L=promised (0) and forecast based on recent_N=5 to reflect the lower recent mean and reduced volatility, so base-stock targets will shrink and avoid excess holding while preserving service.

Daily Reward (R_t): $766.00

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Lead time remains 0 (promised and historically confirmed through Period 22 concludes). Recent demand has shifted lower since ~Period 9; use recent_N=5 to capture current regime. On-hand=20, in-transit=0 so we rely on same-period arrivals (L=0). Selected L=default to keep promised lead time. mu_hat set via recent_N=5 => mean of last 5 demands [462,358,265,353,393]=366.2 units (1+L multiplier applied). sigma_hat set via recent_N=5 => sample std dev of same five = 71.18 units. These parameters bias the base-stock to recent lower demand while preserving service with observed zero lead time.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-22 (Period 24). Lead-time regime remains 0 periods (concluded arrivals in Periods 1\u201323). Demand has shifted lower since ~Period 9; recent 5-demand sample (Periods 19\u201323 = [358,265,353,393,369]) represents current regime. I set L=default (promised 0). I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the new lower mean: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(recent5)=347.6. I set sigma_hat as recent_N=5 sample std to reflect current volatility = 43.54. These parameters keep target base-stock aligned with the recent lower-demand regime while preserving service with observed zero lead time and avoiding excess holding cost.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). On-hand=55, in-transit=0. Lead-time regime: concluded history shows arrivals same-period through Period 25 \u2192 L=0. Demand regime: lower mean since ~Period 9; recent 5 demands (Periods 21\u201325) = [353,393,369,232,298], mean=329.0, std\u224864.5. I choose L=default (promised 0), mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the lower post-change mean (mu_hat = (1+L)*mean = 329.0), and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to reflect recent volatility (\u224864.5). These parameters keep the base-stock tied to the newer, lower demand regime while keeping safety stock aligned to recent variability, reducing holding cost versus using older high-demand history.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Lead-time regime remains 0 (confirmed by concluded arrivals through Period 28). Recent demand regime lowered starting ~Period 24\u201328; using recent_N=5 leverages the latest pattern (demands [232,298,381,493,432], mean=367.2, std\u224893.06). With L=0, mu_hat=(1+L)*recent_mean captures current weekly demand; sigma_hat uses recent std scaled by sqrt(1+L). This keeps base-stock responsive to the recent higher-variance bursts while avoiding excess holding given holding cost.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-09 (Period 31). History shows consistent concluded arrivals same-period through Period 30 \u2192 lead-time regime = 0. Recent demand regime exhibits higher volatility with a large spike in Period 30 (last 5 demands = [381,493,432,396,740]); I use a recent_N=5 demand estimate to capture the current regime. Set L=default (promised 0) because concluded history confirms 0. mu_hat uses recent_N=5: (1+L)*mean(last5)=488.4 to target current demand level. sigma_hat uses recent_N=5 to capture elevated volatility (std \u2248131.56). These parameters keep base-stock responsive to the recent mean/volatility while respecting the zero lead-time regime to balance service vs holding costs.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-09-23. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Lead-time regime has been 0 periods consistently in concluded history (orders on Periods 1\u201332 arrived same period). Recent demand has spiked in the last 3\u20135 weeks (Period 30\u201332 demands: 740, 708, 707). I use L='default' (promised 0) consistent with concluded arrivals. For demand I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the recent higher-demand regime (last 5 concluded demands: 432, 396, 740, 708, 707) giving mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last5) = 596.6. For sigma_hat I use recent_N (N=5) to reflect higher recent volatility; sample std \u2248 167.7 (sqrt(1+L) factor =1). These parameters bias the OR engine toward higher base stock to avoid stockouts amid the recent spike while keeping volatility-driven safety stock explicit.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime = 0 periods confirmed by concluded arrivals in Periods 1\u201332; Recent demand regime shifted higher in the last 5 periods (evidence: demands [432,396,740,708,707]; mean\u2248596.6, std\u2248167.7).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07). On-hand=212, in-transit=0. Lead-time regime has been 0 (concluded arrivals through Period 34). Recent demand regime has shifted higher in the last 5 periods (Periods 30-34 demands = [740,708,707,1428,748]), so I use recent_N=5 for forecasting to capture the uplift. Set L=default (promised 0). mu_hat uses recent_N=5 => (1+L)*mean(last5)=866.2 units. sigma_hat uses recent_N=5 => sqrt(1+L)*std(last5)=281.4 units. These parameters raise the base-stock to cover the recent higher demand while L=0 keeps orders arriving same period to avoid excess pipeline build-up given holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime = 0 confirmed through Period 34; Recent demand regime shifted higher (Periods 30-34 demands = [740,708,707,1428,748]; mean\u2248866.2, std\u2248281.4).

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Lead-time regime remains 0 (confirmed through Period 35 concludes). Recent demand has shifted higher over the last 5 periods (Periods 31-35 demands = [708,707,1428,748,606]; mean \u2248 839.4, std (sample) \u2248 333.2). Use L=default to keep promised lead time 0. Set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the new higher demand regime: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_last5 = 839.4. Set sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to reflect recent volatility: sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std_last5 \u2248 333.2. These parameters raise the base-stock to protect service during the higher-demand regime while keeping holding impact explicit to the OR engine.

Carry-over insight: Recent demand regime shifted higher starting around Period 30; evidence = last 5 demands (Periods 31-35) = [708,707,1428,748,606], mean\u2248839.4, std\u2248333.2; lead-time regime = 0 confirmed through Period 35.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Lead time confirmed at 0 through Period 36 (concluded arrivals each period). Demand has shifted to a higher regime starting ~Period 30; recent 5 demands (Periods 32-36) = [707,1428,748,606,581], mean=814, std\u2248313. I choose L=default (promised 0) because concluded history shows L=0. For demand forecast I use recent_N=5 to capture the new higher regime: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_last5 = 814. For volatility I use recent_N=5: sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std_last5 \u2248 313. These parameters raise the base-stock to match the recent higher demand while keeping lead-time at the confirmed 0, balancing service level against holding cost.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). Lead-time regime remains 0 periods (concluded arrivals through Period 37). On-hand=322, in-transit=0 \u2192 available inventory is healthy but no pipeline. Recent demand regime is the higher regime starting ~Period 30; last 5 demands (Periods 33-37) = [1428,748,606,581,643], mean\u2248801.2, std\u2248356.2. To give the OR engine up-to-date demand over the review+lead period I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat and keep L at the promised default (0). This raises base_stock to reflect the recent higher demand while keeping volatility estimate from the same window. The choices aim to balance service (capture the recent demand spike) against holding costs given substantial on-hand inventory.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-11-04. Historical concludes confirm lead-time = 0 through Period 38. Recent demand has shifted higher in the last 5 periods (Periods 34-38 demands = [748,606,581,643,663]; mean\u2248648.2, std\u224857.45). On-hand=292, in-transit=0; with L=0 only current-period demand matters. I set L=default (promised 0), mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the new higher-demand regime and keep service while limiting holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime = 0 periods confirmed through Period 38; Recent demand regime shifted higher in last 5 periods (Periods 34-38 demands = [748,606,581,643,663]; mean\u2248648.2, std\u224857.45).

Daily Reward (R_t): $779.00

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 Period 40. Lead-time regime remains 0 (concluded arrivals through Period 39). Recent demand regime shifted higher starting ~Period 30; last 5 realized demands (Periods 35-39 = 606,581,643,663,485) have mean \u2248595.6 and std \u224869.7. On-hand =191, in-transit=0; with L=0 we forecast one-period demand only. To keep service while limiting holding cost, I use a recent_N demand estimate (captures the higher post-Period-30 regime) and matching recent volatility for the OR base-stock input.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime = 0 confirmed through Period 39 (evidence: concluded arrivals for orders on Periods 1\u201339 arrived same period); Recent demand regime = higher starting ~Period 30, evidence = last 5 demands (Periods 35\u201339) = [606,581,643,663,485], mean\u2248595.6, std\u224869.7.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). On-hand=45, in-transit=0. Lead-time regime has been consistently 0 in concluded history through Period 40, so use promised lead time. Recent demand regime: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 36\u201340 = [581,643,663,485,581]) show a higher, stable mean; use recent_N=5 to capture current level. Set L=default (promised 0) so orders are treated as same-period arrivals; set mu_hat using recent_N to align base-stock to the elevated recent mean (mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_recent \u2248590.6). Set sigma_hat using recent_N to reflect recent variability (std_recent \u224862.17). This balances service (higher recent demand) against holding cost by sizing base-stock to recent demand plus measured variability while keeping lead time at 0.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Lead time regime remains 0 (concluded arrivals through Period 41). Recent demand regime is the short-term (higher) regime starting ~Period 30; I use the last 5 realized demands (Periods 37\u201341 = [643,663,485,581,547]) to forecast. With L=0, set mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last5)=583.8 to target current-period demand; sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*sample_std(last5)=72.31 to capture recent volatility. This keeps base-stock responsive to the higher recent demand while avoiding excess holding given current on-hand=74 and no in-transit inventory.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime = 0 confirmed through Period 41; Recent demand regime = higher starting ~Period 30 (use recent_N=5 for forecasts).

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). History shows consistent same-period arrivals through Period 42 -> lead-time regime = 0. Recent demand: last 5 demands (Periods 38\u201342) = [663,485,581,547,3100]; mean=875.2, sample std\u22481156.56. Period 42 demand is a large spike; to be responsive while allowing backend to size safety stock, I use recent_N=5 for demand forecasts (keeps responsiveness to regime shifts) and default promised lead time (0). These parameters give the OR engine a short review+lead window (L=0) and a mu_hat that reflects the recent elevated demand, with a large sigma_hat to force higher safety stock cap and avoid stockouts given observed volatility.

LLM Rationale:
Lead time: concluded arrivals through Period 43 show orders arriving same period \u2192 keep L=0. Demand: recent regime shifted higher (large spike Period 42=3100 and elevated surrounding weeks). Use recent_N=5 to capture current elevated mean/volatility (periods 39\u201343 demands = [485,581,547,3100,674]). mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last 5) = 1077.4 to size base-stock for higher demand; sigma_hat uses recent_N=5 to reflect elevated uncertainty (std \u2248 1132.6). These parameters raise target base-stock and widen safety stock to balance lost-sales risk during the spike while accepting higher holding cost given strong recent demand evidence.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime = 0 confirmed through Period 43; Recent demand regime = higher starting ~Period 30, latest evidence (Periods 39-43) = [485,581,547,3100,674] (use recent_N=5).

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Lead-time regime remains 0 (confirmed arrivals through Period 44). Recent demand regime is the higher regime (started ~Period 30); latest 5 demands (Periods 40\u201344 = [581,547,3100,674,680]) show a large spike and elevated mean, so I use recent_N=5 to capture current demand level including the spike. This raises mu_hat and sigma_hat to make the OR backend target a higher base-stock and wider safety stock while promised L=0 keeps arrival timing accurate.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (pre-Christmas). Historical concluded arrivals confirm lead-time regime = 0. Recent demand shows a strong spike (Periods 41-45 demands = [547,3100,674,680,657])\u2014likely holiday-driven; I use the last 5 periods to capture current regime. Set L=promised (0) to reflect confirmed same-day arrivals. mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last5) to force the OR engine to plan for elevated near-term demand. sigma_hat = std(last5) to reflect high volatility from the large outlier so the backend's safety stock widens appropriately.

Daily Profit: $950.00, Daily Holding Cost: $1132.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $-182.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30. Lead-time regime has been 0 through Period 46 (concluded arrivals each period); use promised lead time. On-hand=1132, in-transit=0; recent demand regime shows higher/volatile demand since ~Period 30 with a large spike (3100 at Period 42). To capture current environment while remaining responsive to recent changes, I use recent_N=5 (last 5 demands: [3100,674,680,657,475]) for forecast and volatility. This produces mu_hat = mean(last5) = 1117.2 and sigma_hat = sample std(last5) \u2248 1218.13. With L=0 these parameters make the OR backend target service given current high/volatile demand while avoiding under-ordering given on-hand stock.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime = 0 periods confirmed through Period 46; Recent demand regime shifted higher and is volatile since ~Period 30, latest five-demands contain a large outlier (3100, Period 42).
