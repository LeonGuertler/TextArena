Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Historical demands = [694,576,685,715,774] -> mean ~ 689; on-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so stockless now. Promised lead time=2 with no concluded arrivals to suggest deviation. Use default lead time and default demand/volatility calculations so OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample; this balances service level (large demand mean) against holding cost given slim profit margin.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). No concluded arrivals yet (Period 1 conclude shows ordered=808 arrived=0) so actual lead time is unobserved; possible in-transit shipment may still arrive on schedule. Historical demand samples = [694,576,685,715,774], mean \u2248 688.8, no clear changepoint or seasonality signal in this short series. On-hand=0, in-transit=808 covers ~1.17\xd7 mean demand (808 vs mean 689) but promised lead time is 2 periods so we must plan for (1+L) periods of demand. I use default lead time (promised L=2) because no concluded lead-time observations exist to justify deviation. For demand forecast and volatility I use the defaults (all-sample mean/std scaled by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L)) to let the OR engine compute base-stock and cap using full-history statistics; this balances service level against holding cost conservatively given the limited data and uncertain arrivals.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/2/25. Historical demand mean \u2248688.8 (samples [694,576,685,715,774]). Concluded arrival in Period 2 shows an observed lead time of 1 period for the order placed in Period 1 (arrived=808, lead_time=1), which differs from the promised 2. Use calculate for L to let backend adopt the average observed lead time (1). With L=1, set mu_hat and sigma_hat to default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. Note on-hand+in-transit=928, which is below (1+L)\xd7mean\xd7(safety); parameters aim to reflect the shorter observed lead time while relying on backend safety calculation.

Carry-over insight: Observed lead time = 1 period (Period 2 conclude: arrived=808 units ordered on Period 1, lead_time was 1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $270.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/4 (Period 4). Recent conclude messages show an arrived=808 (ordered P1) with lead_time=1 observed in Period 3 conclude, so actual lead time appears 1 (shorter than promised 2). Current on-hand=0, in-transit=1270 (these are pipeline units). I set L to be calculated from observed lead times to capture the recent 1-period regime. For demand I use default aggregation ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) because the provided past demands [694,576,685,715,774] show no strong persistent shift beyond the lead-time change; sigma_hat left at default to reflect historical variability. These choices reduce over-ordering risk under the shorter observed lead time while keeping the backend's base-stock grounded in historical demand and variability.

Carry-over insight: Observed actual lead time = 1 period (Period 2 conclude: arrived=808 units ordered on Period 1, lead_time was 1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $548.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/11 (Period 5). On-hand=346, in-transit=585. Historical arrivals show inconsistent lead times: an order placed in Period 1 arrived in Period 2 (lead_time=1) and an order placed in Period 2 arrived in Period 4 (lead_time=2). No clear lost shipments, but lead time has varied. To balance service vs. holding cost I set L to the calculated average of observed lead times so the OR engine accounts for observed variability; mu_hat and sigma_hat use defaults so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the demand samples, preserving consistency with its capped policy.

Carry-over insight: Observed lead-time variability: lead_time=1 observed for order (Period1\u2192Period2); lead_time=2 observed for order (Period2\u2192Period4); average observed lead_time = 1.5 (use as inferred regime).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/18. Recent demand samples mean=688.8 (n=5); on-hand=0, in-transit=891. Historical concludes show mixed lead times (1 and 2 periods) with average observed lead time \u22481.5; some shipments arrived late but not lost. To hedge against shorter-than-promised arrivals while reflecting observed regime, set L explicit=1.5. Use mu_hat default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples (captures full-sample demand of 688.8 with L=1.5 \u2192 2.5\xd7 mean). Use sigma_hat default so backend scales full-sample volatility by sqrt(1+L). This balances service level (accounting for observed faster arrivals) against holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Carry-over insight: Observed lead-time regime shifted to mixed 1\u20132 periods; average observed lead_time=1.5 (evidence: Period2\u2192Period3 lead_time=1; Period2\u2192Period4 lead_time=2; average over observed orders =1.5).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). Recent history shows mixed lead times (observed 1 and 2 periods; average ~1.5) and volatile demand samples [694,576,685,715,774] with current on-hand=0, in-transit=1636. I set L explicit=1.5 to reflect the observed mixed 1\u20132 period regime so the OR engine plans across the effective multi-period pipeline. I choose mu_hat default and sigma_hat default so backend uses (1+L)\xd7sample mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7sample std (leveraging full sample history) \u2014 conservative aggregation given limited samples and lead-time uncertainty. This balances service (higher base_stock from L>1) against holding cost while acknowledging some shipments may have variable arrival timings.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). Recent demand samples show high, stable weekly demand (past demands: 694,576,685,715,774). On-hand=0, in-transit=1222 \u2014 pipeline sizeable but past arrivals show mixed lead times (observed 1\u20132 periods). Use L=calculate to let backend infer the averaged observed lead time from concluded history (captures the 1\u20132 period mix). For demand forecast use recent_N (N=5) to base mu_hat on the last 5 samples (captures current high-demand regime). Use default sigma_hat to reflect overall observed variability scaled by (1+L). These choices balance service level (capturing elevated mean demand and mixed lead time) vs holding cost given a large in-transit position.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). Recent demand history = [694,576,685,715,774]; on-hand=185, in-transit=477. Observed concluded lead times from history: Period1\u21922=1, Period2\u21924=2, Period4\u21925=1, Period5\u21927=2, Period6\u21928=2 \u2192 average observed lead_time \u2248 1.6 (mixed 1\u20132 regime). Several shipments showed lead_time=2 recently, so use inferred lead-time from observed history rather than promised. I select L=calculate to let the backend use the average observed lead time; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples. This balances service (accounting for longer/mixed lead times) vs holding cost while leveraging full sample statistics given limited demand shifts.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime = mixed 1\u20132 periods; observed lead_times = [1,2,1,2,2], mean \u2248 1.6 (evidence: arrived records Period2,4,5,7,8).

LLM Rationale:

Observed concluded lead-times (recent 5) = [1,2,1,2,2], mean \u22481.6 indicating a mixed 1\u20132 period regime. I choose L as recent_N (N=5) to reflect the mixed/unstable lead-time behavior rather than the promised fixed 2. mu_hat and sigma_hat use default historical calculations so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, letting the backend combine this demand estimate with the inferred lead time. This balances service (capturing longer effective lead time) against holding cost given significant in-transit stock (1082) that will reduce ordering needs.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). Recent concluded history shows mixed lead-times (1\u20132 periods) with mean \u22481.6 and several overdue/no-arrival events; on-hand=0, in-transit=1240. To hedge variability I set L explicit=1.6 to reflect observed mixed regime. Demand has fallen from earlier peaks; I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat (periods 6\u201310) to capture the latest demand regime (mean ~435 units, more relevant than older samples). These settings increase the review+lead demand forecast and volatility based on recent data, improving service while acknowledging holding cost via the OR backend's cap.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime = mixed 1\u20132 periods; observed lead_times = [1,2,1,2,2], mean \u2248 1.6 (evidence: arrivals recorded in Periods 2,4,5,7,8).

Period 12 (2019-04-29): recent arrivals show mixed 1\u20132 period lead times (observed lead_times = [1,2,1,2,2,2], mean \u22481.67). On-hand=344, in-transit=635. To reflect the empirically mixed lead-time regime I set L using recent observed lead times (recent_N=6). Demand history is limited but stable; let backend compute mu_hat and sigma_hat using default formulas ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR engine applies its capped ordering logic with the inferred L.

LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=163, in-transit=680. Historical arrivals show a mixed 1\u20132 period lead-time regime (observed lead_times from concluded arrivals: 1,2,1,2,2,2,2) \u2014 suggest using observed-average lead time rather than promised. Use L=calculate so backend computes average observed lead time from concluded arrivals; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so demand scaling uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples, letting the OR engine set base-stock while accounting for longer/mixed lead-time regime. This balances service (capture longer observed lead time) vs holding cost (defaults keep volatility-based safety stock).

Inventory: on-hand=125, in-transit=794 (multiple recent arrivals observed with mixed 1\u20132 period lead times).

Use a recent_N estimate for L to capture the mixed 1\u20132 regime. Demand history available (5 samples); use recent_N for mu_hat over those 5 samples to reflect current demand level across the review+lead period. Use default volatility scaling for sigma_hat. These choices make the OR backend target a base stock that accounts for the observed shorter/variable lead times and current demand while leveraging the large in-transit pipeline to avoid over-ordering.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). On-hand=0, in-transit=1008. Historical concluded arrivals show mixed lead-times of 1\u20132 periods (observed lead_times \u2248 [1,2,1,2,2], mean \u22481.6) and several overdue/missing arrivals earlier\u2014so use a recent-average lead-time rather than promised=2. Set L using recent_N=5 to capture the observed mixed 1\u20132 regime. For demand forecasting use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from demand samples, letting the backend combine with its service-level math; this keeps the forecast anchored to full history while the adjusted L accounts for faster-than-promised arrivals and reduces over-ordering given holding cost.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). On-hand=0, in-transit=775. Historical concluded arrivals show variable lead-times with a recent longer delay (Period13\u2192Period16 arrived=317, lead_time=3). Observed lead_times = [1,2,1,2,2,2,2,1,3], mean \u22481.78 \u2192 signals upward shift from prior ~1.6 regime. To reflect observed lead-time regime without overfitting short-term noise, set L to be calculated from observed lead times (backend average). Use default demand sizing (mu_hat default) and default volatility (sigma_hat default) so the OR engine computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from full sample history while respecting backend capping. This balances service (capture higher effective lead time) against holding cost given zero on-hand but large in-transit; using backend defaults avoids overreacting to a single long delay while letting L adjust upward.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime appears to have shifted upward: recent arrival Period13\u219216 had lead_time=3; observed lead_times now [1,2,1,2,2,2,2,1,3], mean \u22481.78 (use this updated average going forward).

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). On-hand=0, in-transit=1093. Historical demands show mean\u2248688.8 (samples [694,576,685,715,774]). Recent arrival history shows lead-time has shifted upward (most recent observed lead_time=3 for Period13\u219216) raising the average observed lead_time to \u22481.78. To reflect the longer, variable lead-time and avoid stockouts given current pipeline uncertainty, I set L explicitly to the updated observed average (1.78). I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples) so the OR engine uses the full sample demand base scaled by the chosen L.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime shifted upward: recent arrivals include a lead_time=3 (Period13\u219216); observed lead_times now [1,2,1,2,2,2,2,1,3], mean \u22481.78 (use this updated average going forward).

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). On-hand=0, in-transit=1405. Historical arrivals show lead-times recently increased (recent observed lead_times include a 3-period arrival), raising the observed average to \u22481.78. Several orders have been delayed or variable (mix of 1\u20133 periods) so treating lead time as longer than the promised 2 reduces risk of stockouts. I set L explicit to the inferred recent average (1.78) to force the OR engine to size orders for a longer effective pipeline. For demand parameters I use defaults so the backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples \u2014 this leverages the full historical demand seed while the explicit L captures the shifted lead-time regime and compensates for missing/delayed arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime shifted upward; recent observed lead_times include a 3-period event (Period13\u219216) and the mean of observed lead_times \u2248 1.78 (evidence: observed lead_times history [1,2,1,2,2,2,2,1,3]).

I set L explicitly to 1.78 to capture the raised effective lead time and protect against under-ordering given in-transit uncertainty. mu_hat and sigma_hat left as default so the OR backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of demand samples, balancing service level vs holding cost.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). Recent arrival history shows lead-time regime has shifted upward with a 3-period event; observed lead_times \u2248 [1,2,1,2,2,2,2,1,3], mean \u2248 1.78. On-hand=449, in-transit=769; pipeline partly reflects delayed/late arrivals so we increase effective L to cover longer arrivals. Set L explicit=1.78 to reflect observed regime.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:

To protect service given variable lead times (1\u20133, mean\u22481.78) I set L explicit=1.78 so the OR engine plans across the longer effective lead-time. Demand history mean=688.8 with no clear downward/upward demand shift, so use mu_hat default to let backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean. Similarly use sigma_hat default so backend scales observed volatility by sqrt(1+L). These choices bias stocking toward higher cover for longer/more-variable lead-times while relying on observed demand stats to balance holding cost vs stockouts.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/15 Period 23. On-hand=0, in-transit=1255. Historical arrivals show recent upward shift in lead times including a 3-period event (Period13\u219216) and observed lead_times = [1,2,1,2,2,2,2,1,3], mean \u22481.78. To protect against underestimated pipeline and lost/late shipments, set L explicitly to the observed recent average (1.78).

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime shifted upward: recent observed lead_times include a 3-period event; observed lead_times = [1,2,1,2,2,2,2,1,3], mean \u2248 1.78. Use this updated average going forward.

To protect service vs. holding cost I set explicit L to the inferred observed mean so the OR engine covers longer arrivals; use default demand/statistics so backend uses full sample mean/std scaled by (1+L). In-transit inventory (1244) should be included by backend when computing order. Methods chosen: explicit L to capture upward shift; default mu_hat/sigma_hat to leverage full demand history for stability.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=0, in-transit=1365 \u2014 pipeline is sizable but arrivals have been variable with observed lead-time regime shifting upward (recent observed mean lead_time \u22481.78, incl. 3-period events). I select L via 'calculate' so the OR backend uses the empirical average observed lead times; mu_hat and sigma_hat use 'default' so backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std based on full demand history. This balances service (higher L increases required base-stock) against holding cost given large pipeline and history of lost/late arrivals.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26 (Period 29). On-hand=0, in-transit=1365. Historical arrivals show increased lead-time variability with recent 3-period events; use an explicit L to reflect the upward-shifted regime (mean observed \u22481.78). Demand sample mean \u2248688.8; (1+L)*mean \u2248 1916.6 \u2192 set mu_hat explicit=1917 to size the base-stock for the longer lead-time. Empirical std \u224872, scaled by sqrt(1+L) \u22481.667 \u2192 sigma_hat \u2248120 to capture volatility. These explicit settings help the OR backend raise target base-stock for service while acknowledging higher holding cost by using a measured increase rather than an extreme safety buffer. Current in-transit (1365) will partially cover the (L+1)-period demand but explicit L and mu_hat ensure new orders account for the longer regime.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/9 (Period 31). Demand history recent samples = [694,576,685,715,774]; on-hand=0, in-transit=1848. Historical arrivals show a sustained upward shift in lead times with a 3-period event (Period13\u219216) raising the observed mean lead_time to \u22481.78 across observed orders (evidence: observed lead_times = [1,2,1,2,2,2,2,1,3], mean \u22481.78). Several orders have been delayed beyond the promised 2-period lead time and some arrivals occurred at L=3; to protect service level I set L explicitly to the observed mean (1.78). I leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean(demand) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(demand) using the explicit L \u2014 this increases target base-stock to cover the longer effective lead time while avoiding ad-hoc demand reweighting.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). Recent demand samples are high (~600-770); on-hand=0, in-transit=1407 which should cover multiple periods given elevated lead times. Historical concluded arrivals show lead-time regime shifted upward with a 3-period event; observed mean lead_time \u22481.78. To guard against lost/longer shipments, set L explicitly to 1.78. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to base forecast on the latest 5 demand samples, scaled by (1+L) in backend; keep sigma_hat at default to let backend compute volatility from full sample set. These choices increase target base-stock to protect service level under longer/mixed lead times while relying on recent demand for level forecast.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime shifted upward: recent observed lead_times include a 3-period event; observed lead_times mean \u2248 1.78 (evidence: arrival history includes a 3-period lead_time Period13\u219216 among prior 1\u20132 period events).

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:

Lead-times have shown upward drift including 3-period events; recent observed mean \u22481.78. To protect service given high recent demand and increased lead-time variability, set L explicitly to 1.78. Use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent higher-demand regime (last 5 demands ~396,740,708,707,1428 -> mean \u2248795.8) so base-stock reflects current surge while sigma from same window captures recent volatility.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/10/7 (Period 35). On-hand=0, in-transit=2115. Historical arrivals show a persistent upward-shifted mixed lead-time regime with occasional 3-period events; observed mean lead_time \u2248 1.78. To protect service given in-transit volume uncertainty and observed longer tails, I set L explicitly to 1.78 (captures recent 3-period events). Demand history mean is stable (sample mean=688.8 over provided samples); I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using the chosen L, letting the backend combine this with its capped ordering rule. This balances higher safety stock for occasional longer lead times while avoiding manual overstatement of demand volatility.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/10/14 (Period 36). On-hand=0, in-transit=2115. Historical arrivals show lead-time regime shifted upward with a 3-period event (Period13\u219216) and recent observed lead_times mean \u22481.78.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime shifted upward: recent observed lead_times include a 3-period event (Period13\u219216); observed lead_times = [1,2,1,2,2,2,2,1,3], mean \u2248 1.78. Use this updated average going forward.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21): recent demand history shows large, volatile weekly demand (past samples mean \u2248 688 from seed samples and many large spikes). On-hand=0, in-transit=2115 (substantial pipeline). Historical concluded arrivals show a sustained upward-shifted lead-time regime with occasional 3-period events; observed mean lead_time \u2248 1.78. To ensure the OR engine accounts for the longer/mixed lead-time regime (and avoid stockouts despite in-transit uncertainty), set L explicitly to the observed mean ~1.78. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from demand samples given our stock pipeline; this balances higher reorder coverage for longer lead time while letting the OR engine apply its capped order cap using the full sample statistics.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019/10/28). Recent demand samples are high (past demands ~[694,576,685,715,774]; recent history shows many stockouts and large, variable weekly demand peaks up to 1428). On-hand=0, in-transit=2115 \u2014 pipeline is sizable but arrivals are subject to observed lead-time drift. Historical concluded arrivals show mixed 1\u20133 period lead times with a recent upward shift; observed mean lead_time \u2248 1.78. To protect service while avoiding excess holding cost, set lead time L explicitly to the inferred mean (1.78) so backend inflates the (1+L) review window appropriately. Use default demand/statistics (backend (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std over all samples) so the OR engine leverages full historical demand while accounting for longer effective lead time. This balances higher safety-stock need from longer/mixed lead times against holding cost given a large in-transit position.

Recent demand (Periods 34-38 = [748,606,581,643,663]) is elevated versus earlier baseline; use recent window to capture current demand level and volatility. Set L explicit to 1.78 to reflect observed mixed 1\u20133 period regime. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to make the OR engine target inventory for the current higher demand regime while limiting excess stock given holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=0, in-transit=2115. Historical concluded arrivals show a persistent upward-shifted lead-time regime including a 3-period event; use observed lead times to infer L rather than trusting promised. Use backend 'calculate' to set L from observed lead times. Demand samples (historical) are limited to provided past samples, so use default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std) to let OR engine scale with inferred L while the backend's capped order logic controls order size.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime shifted upward: recent observed lead_times include a 3-period event (Period13\u219216). Observed lead_times history mean \u2248 1.78; use this updated average going forward.

Lead-time history shows a sustained upward shift including a 3-period event; recent observed mean lead_time \u22481.78. To account for upward-shifted lead times and avoid stockouts, set L explicitly to 1.78.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/25 (Period 42). On-hand=0, in-transit=2115. Historical arrivals show recent occasional 3-period events raising observed mean lead time to ~1.78 (evidence in conclude history: observed lead_times include a 3-period event Period13\u219216 among many 1\u20132 period events). To protect service while acknowledging longer recent delays I set L explicitly to the updated observed mean (1.78). Demand history samples are limited but stationary; use default demand/volatility calculations so OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std automatically. This balances higher safety-stock for longer effective lead time while letting the backend use sample stats for exact base_stock and cap.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime shifted upward: recent observed lead_times include a 3-period event (Period13\u219216); observed lead_times = [1,2,1,2,2,2,2,1,3], mean \u2248 1.78. Use this updated average going forward.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/2 (Period 43). Recent arrival history includes a 3-period lead-time event (Period13\u219216) and the observed lead_time series mean \u22481.78. On-hand=0, in-transit=2115. To protect service vs. large recent spike (Period 42 demand=3100) I set lead time to the inferred elevated value and use explicit mu/sigma to up-weight inventory target and absorb volatility while keeping holding cost in mind.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime elevated: recent observed lead_times include a 3-period event; observed lead_times mean \u2248 1.78 (evidence: arrival history includes Period13\u219216 lead_time=3 among prior 1\u20132 period events).

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019/12/9). Recent arrival history shows elevated lead-time regime with a 3-period event (Period13\u219216) and observed mean lead_time \u22481.78; on-hand=0, in-transit=2388. Demand history includes a large spike (Period42 demand=3100) indicating elevated short-term demand volatility. I set L explicit to capture the empirically observed mean lead time (1.78) so the OR engine sizes orders for a longer-than-promised pipeline. mu_hat and sigma_hat use default methods so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the full sample set, letting the engine combine the adjusted review+lead window with observed demand stats to balance service level vs holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime elevated: recent observed lead_times include a 3-period event (Period13\u219216); observed lead_times mean \u2248 1.78 \u2014 use this updated average going forward.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). Recent demand pattern shows high weekly demand and a major spike in Period 42 (3100) \u2014 demand samples are elevated. On-hand=0, in-transit=2115. Historical observed lead_times include a 3-period event (Period13\u219216) and recent series with mean \u22481.78, so I treat lead time as elevated. I set L explicit=1.78 to reflect the upward-shifted regime. I use default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, letting it scale safety stock appropriately given the longer effective lead time and the profit/holding tradeoff. This balances service level (higher L \u2192 larger base_stock) against holding cost while acknowledging overdue/lost shipment risk signaled by past multi-period arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime elevated: recent observed lead_times include a 3-period event; observed lead_times mean \u2248 1.78 (use this elevated average going forward).

On-hand=0, in-transit=2115 \u2014 with L\u22481.78, pipeline covers ~2115 units against (1+L) periods of demand. I set L explicit=1.78 to reflect the elevated, mixed 1\u20133 period regime (avoids under-ordering when 3-period events occur). I set mu_hat explicit using (1+L)\xd7mean(historical demands) to scale forecast to the extended review+lead window given elevated lead time: mean(demand)=688.8 \u2192 mu_hat\u22481914.86. I keep sigma_hat=default so backend computes volatility from all samples scaled by sqrt(1+L), preserving conservative safety stock from historical variability. These choices trade higher service level (to avoid stockouts during holiday demand and intermittent 3-period delays) against holding cost.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/30 Period 47. Historical arrivals show an elevated lead-time regime including a 3-period event (Period13\u219216) raising the observed mean lead_time to \u22481.78 across recent arrivals. In-transit=2216; on-hand=0 so upstream delays risk stockouts. I set L explicit to 1.78 to force the OR engine to plan for the longer/mixed lead-time regime (covers delayed arrivals and reduces lost-shipment risk). For demand parameters I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the demand samples, leveraging the full history while the explicit L captures the changed delivery regime.
