Demand regime: recent non-spike demand average used as baseline \u2248584 units/period (Periods 37\u201341) per carry-over insight; subsequent weeks showed demand around ~650 (Periods 42\u201345 sold: 1006 constrained by stock, 601,240,581 sold because of stockouts) \u2014 evidence of elevated late-Nov/Dec demand but not a confirmed sustained regime change. Lead time & pipeline: actual lead_time = 4 periods confirmed. On-hand=0, in-transit=2519 (these arrive across upcoming periods per their order dates). Coverage target: need to cover L+1=5 periods of demand (current period demand occurs after decision). Conservative forecast for upcoming 5 periods = 5 * 584 = 2920 units. Pipeline shortfall = 2920 - 2519 = 401 units. Cost tradeoff: profit = $2/unit vs holding = $1/unit/period; avoid large overorders. Final decision: order enough to cover shortfall with minimal excess = 400 units (rounding to practical lot).",

Need to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand after decision. e) Order logic: Forecast demand for next 5 periods = 622 * 5 = 3110. Shortfall = 3110 - 2444 = 666.
