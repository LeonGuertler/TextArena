Period 47 (2019/12/30) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "World/calendar: Period 47 is 2019-12-30 (year-end/holiday window just passed) \u2014 small uplift possible but no new holiday spike expected. Demand regime: recent confirmed regime is the higher-demand regime (Periods 30\u201336 and sustained thereafter) with period-level demands often 600\u2013750; recent observed demands: P43=674, P44=680 (stockout so censored), P45=657, P46=475 (some censoring earlier). Lead time / pipeline: actual lead time confirmed = 4 periods (carry-over). Current on-hand = 0, in-transit = 3260 units (these are expected to arrive per historical concludes from prior orders). Decision rule: must cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand after ordering. Conservatively forecast 5-period demand \u2248 5\xd7650 = 3250 units (uses recent higher-demand regime). In-transit (3260) \u2248 forecast requirement, so no new order needed to avoid excess holding cost. Ordering now would create holding cost and risk if demand softens; with confirmed lead time 4 and adequate pipeline, place zero order.",
