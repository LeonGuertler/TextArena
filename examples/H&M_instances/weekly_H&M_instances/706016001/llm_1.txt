No on-hand or in-transit inventory and supplier promised lead_time=0 but actual lead time unknown; no concluded arrivals to infer delays. Decision rule: cover one period of expected demand plus minimal safety because holding cost ($1) is low relative to profit ($4) but delayed arrivals are possible. I therefore place an order approximating the historical one-period demand (689 units) to maximize sales this period while keeping holding exposure reasonable.",
