Target coverage: cover 5 periods of elevated demand. I choose a conservative per-period demand of ~700 units (near historical single-period peaks and to protect against lost sales in surge). Required supply = 5*700 = 3500 units. Subtract pipeline 1135 \u2192 order = 2365 units.

Objective requires balancing sales vs holding; with 2826 units available, ordering more now would raise holding costs with limited incremental profit given long lead time. Conclusion: place no new order this period to avoid unnecessary holding cost while observing whether holiday surge realizes in upcoming concluded arrivals/demands.
