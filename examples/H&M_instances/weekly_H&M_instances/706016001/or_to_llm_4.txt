OR computed cap\u2248808 and recommended 808 (it used base-stock but capped aggressively). Lead-time & risk: actual lead time unknown (only promised L=4 available); orders placed now will arrive in Period 5 (no arrivals before then).

OR's capped 808 would leave large unmet demand through arrival and cause heavy lost sales. Tradeoffs: profit per unit $4 >> holding $1/period, so understocking (lost sales) is more costly relative to modest holding. I therefore order to cover the (L+1)-period expected demand rather than follow OR's one-period capped recommendation.

Order decision: place 3444 units now to replenish pipeline to cover expected demand over the 5-period lead+review horizon. This addresses the long lead time and zero pipeline; I accept holding exposure once stock arrives because profit margin justifies it. I will monitor concluded arrivals and realized lead time in future periods to adjust orders and avoid chronic overstock if arrivals are lost or demand shifts.",

This balances avoiding stockouts through the upcoming holiday tail while limiting extra holding cost given large existing pipeline.
