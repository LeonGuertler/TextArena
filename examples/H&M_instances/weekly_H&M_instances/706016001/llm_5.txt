Lead time: supplier actual lead_time confirmed = 4 periods (consistent historical evidence). Inventory/pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=2866 units.

Forecast: assume holiday-elevated demand \u2248670 units/period \u2192 5-period demand \u22483350 units. Pipeline shortfall \u22483350\u22122866 = 484 units. Objective tradeoff: profit $2/unit vs holding $1/unit/period \u2014 keep order minimal to avoid excess holding after season. Final order logic: place a modest top-up to cover the shortfall (~484); round to practical lot (500) to reduce stockout risk while limiting holding cost.",
