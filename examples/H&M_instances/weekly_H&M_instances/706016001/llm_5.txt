Lead time & pipeline: promised lead time = 4 periods; no on-hand and no in-transit, and no concluded arrivals exist yet, so assume supplier will deliver with L=4 unless evidence to contrary. Decision timing: orders placed now (Period 1) will arrive during Period 5 and be observed in Period 6 conclude; current period and next 4 periods' demand must be covered from existing on-hand + order arriving later. Safety-stock logic: to avoid lost sales, target coverage = (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Forecast demand for next 5 periods = 5 * 688 = 3,440 units. Holding vs profit tradeoff: profit $2/unit, holding $1/unit/period \u2014 holding is significant but lost sales forego $2 profit; given high baseline demand and long lead time, fill pipeline rather than risk stockouts. Final order: place 3,440 units to cover next 5 periods given zero on-hand/in-transit and presumed L=4.",
