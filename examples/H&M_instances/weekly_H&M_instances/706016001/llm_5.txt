Product: women's skinny denim trousers \u2014 staple apparel with no strong immediate one-off seasonal spike; Valentine's Day may raise apparel interest slightly but not likely to multiply jeans demand. Historical unified samples for SKU 706016001: [694, 576, 685, 715, 774]. Sample mean \u2248 689 units per period; recent samples show stable high demand (range 576\u2013774) with no clear upward or downward regime shift. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Supplier promised lead_time=0 but actual lead_time is unknown; if actual lead_time>0 arrivals will not come this period. To target high service level and capture expected sales this period, place order to cover expected demand (~689 units). This balances profit ($4/unit sold) versus holding cost ($1/unit/period); ordering roughly the historical mean maximizes expected profit while limiting excess inventory risk given stable history.
