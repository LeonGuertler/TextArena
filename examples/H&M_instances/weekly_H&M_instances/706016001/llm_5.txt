Historical demand samples for SKU 706016001: [694, 576, 685, 715, 774] => mean \u2248 689 units, moderate variance. Inventory/pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=0, supplier promised lead_time=0 but actual lead_time unknown (no concluded arrivals yet). Risk: if actual lead_time>0 or orders are lost, arrival will be delayed; however promised 0 implies same-period arrival is likely. Objective: maximize Profit*units_sold \u2212 HoldingCost*ending_inventory. Profit per sold unit = $2; holding cost = $1 per unit per period, so over-ordering reduces objective if units remain unsold next period. Order logic: target to meet expected period demand \u2248 mean 689 and avoid large ending inventory. Given zero on-hand/in-transit and promised 0 lead time, place an order equal to expected demand this period (round to nearest whole unit).",
