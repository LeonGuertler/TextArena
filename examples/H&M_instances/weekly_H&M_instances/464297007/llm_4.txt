No in-game evidence yet of a regime shift (only baseline samples). c) Lead time / missing orders: Supplier promised lead time = 2 periods; no prior arrivals to contradict this. On-hand=0, in-transit=0, so treat L=2 as working prior. d) Inventory & pipeline assessment: With L=2, order placed now will arrive in Period 3 and become visible in the Period 3 conclude message. Demand for the current period occurs after decision, so we must cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand (Periods 1\u20133). e) Final order logic: Use historical mean \u2248237 units/period, and apply a Valentine\u2019s uplift (conservative +25\u201330%) because date is immediately before Feb 14. Forecast \u2248 296 units/period \xd7 3 periods \u2248 888 units. There is no evidence of lost shipments or changed lead time; ordering this quantity aims to meet the expected 3-period spike while accepting per-period holding cost ($1/unit) vs profit ($4/unit).",

Shortfall \u2248 1,320 \u2212 959 = 361 units. To be conservative for demand variability and Christmas spike, order 400 units. This balances lost-sales risk (high forgone profit $4/unit) vs holding cost $1/unit/period.",
