An order of 1250 placed in Period 1 is currently in-transit and has not yet concluded (arrived=0 in Period 1 conclude is expected for a 4-period lead time).

  "rationale": "Date 2019-12-23 (week before Christmas) \u2014 holiday period likely increases demand. Recent realized demand P43\u2013P45 = [266,380,360], avg \u2248335, which is ~40% above baseline (~238) but is only a short 3-period run. Lead time confirmed = 4 (already recorded). Current availability: on-hand=290 + in-transit=1100 = 1390 units. With L=4 we must cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand after ordering; even using elevated demand \u2248335/unit, 1390 units cover ~4.15 periods and will be augmented by any late arrivals already in-transit (arrivals from P42/P43 will occur during upcoming periods). Given high pipeline, significant ordering now would incur unnecessary holding cost ($1/unit/period) and reduce objective. Recommend no new order this period to avoid excess holding costs while current supply covers near-term elevated demand.",

{
  "rationale": "World/calendar: Date 2019-12-30 -> end-of-year/NYE period; holiday season demand for women's underwear is elevated. Demand analysis: recent concluded demands show sustained elevated demand: Periods 44\u201346 demands = 380, 360, 358 (avg \u2248366), well above baseline (~238). Lead time: confirmed historically as 4 periods (Period 1\u21925, and many subsequent confirms). Inventory & pipeline: on-hand=632, in-transit=400 => total available = 1032. Planning rule: cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand since orders placed now arrive after 4 periods and current period demand occurs post-decision. Forecast 5-period demand = 5 * 366 = 1830. Required order = 1830 - 1032 = 798. Adjust for rounding and holding cost tradeoff: order slightly below to avoid excessive holding given high holding cost ($1/unit) but maintain high service level during holiday persistence.
