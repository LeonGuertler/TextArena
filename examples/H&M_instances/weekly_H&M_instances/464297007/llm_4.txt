  "rationale": "World knowledge & product: SKU is women's thong underwear; date 2019-02-11 is three days before Valentine's Day (2019-02-14), a likely short-term demand uplift for lingerie. Historical demand samples for this SKU: [267,298,307,189,122] => mean ~237 with high variance; recent samples include several values near/above 267\u2013307 indicating regular multi-hundred weekly demand. Inventory/pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Lead time: supplier promised 0 periods but actual lead time unknown; cannot infer without concluded arrivals. Decision logic: because arrivals happen after decision and lead time may be \u22650, we should place an order to cover the imminent Valentine-driven spike plus baseline demand for the current period. Balance profit ($4/unit) vs holding cost ($1/unit/period): holding cost is moderate, so avoid extreme overstock. I choose an order close to historical single-period demand but modestly conservative to capture the likely short-term spike: 260 units.",
