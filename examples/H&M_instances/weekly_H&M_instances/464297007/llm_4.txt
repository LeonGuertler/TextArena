{
  "rationale": "World/calendar: Date is 2019-02-11, three days before Valentine's Day (2019-02-14). Female underwear (lingerie/tho ng) can see a short Valentine uplift; assume a mild near-term demand increase. Demand regime: use provided historical samples for SKU 464297007: [267,298,307,189,122], mean = 236.6 units/period. Given possible Valentine uplift, inflate forecast modestly to ~250 units/period for the next periods. Lead time & pipeline: supplier promised lead_time = 4 periods. No in-transit or on-hand inventory (0,0). With lead_time=4, decision must cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand because arrivals occur after period+4 and current-period demand still occurs after ordering. Risk tradeoff: profit $2/unit vs holding cost $1/unit/period \u2014 holding is high, so avoid large safety stock beyond covering expected demand for the coverage window. Final order logic: order enough to cover 5 periods \xd7 forecast (5 \xd7 250 \u2248 1,250). Using the historical mean (236.6) gives 5\xd7236.6 \u2248 1,183; balancing mild holiday uplift and high holding cost, choose a rounded conservative order of 1,183 units to cover the L+1 window without excess.",

Inventory: on-hand=0 but in-transit should arrive per promised schedule; no concluded arrivals yet so cannot infer LT deviations. Decision logic: avoid adding more inventory because current pipeline already covers the (L+1)-period demand, holding cost is high ($1/unit/period) relative to profit ($2/unit), and near-term demand likely soft after Valentine\u2019s.
