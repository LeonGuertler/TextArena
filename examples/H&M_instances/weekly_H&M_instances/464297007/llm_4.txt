Product: women's thong underwear \u2014 seasonally relevant as a potential Valentine\u2019s purchase. Historical prior demand samples for SKU 464297007 = [267, 298, 307, 189, 122], mean \u2248 238 units; recent spread shows variability but no clear trend. Lead-time: supplier promised 0, but actual lead-time unknown; no concluded arrivals available to infer; therefore assume supplier may deliver same-period but remain cautious. Inventory: on-hand 0, in-transit 0. Decision logic: balance high expected period demand (~238) against high holding cost ($1/unit/period) and modest profit ($2/unit). To capture likely Valentine\u2019s surge this period while avoiding excessive holding, order ~expected demand (rounding to 240). This order will serve demand if actual lead-time = 0; if lead-time >0 we risk stockout but avoiding large holding costs if demand is lower than forecast.",
