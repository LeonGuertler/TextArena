OR cap calculation yields cap \u2248236.6+1.645\xb779.1\u2248366.8, so OR returns 367 (capped). Reality/lead-time: promised lead time=2 and there are no concluded arrivals yet, so actual lead time is unobserved; cannot assume faster arrivals. With on-hand=0 and in-transit=0, we need to plan for (L+1)=3 periods of demand (current period demand will still occur after decision). Expected demand over 3 periods \u2248710 units. OR's cap (367) is well below the 3-period expected demand, which would create stockouts and lost profit once arrivals happen. Holding cost is $1/period and profit $2/unit, so under-stocking loses potential profit of ~$2 per unit sold; modest holding cost favors meeting expected demand. I therefore override the OR cap and order up to the estimated 3-period expected demand, rounding to nearest whole unit: 710 units. This targets covering the full (L+1) demand estimate given no pipeline and no evidence of shorter lead time. If future concluded messages show shorter/longer lead time or lost shipments, adjust accordingly.",
