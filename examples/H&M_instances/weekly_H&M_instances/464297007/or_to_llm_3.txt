{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: concluded history through P46 shows orders arriving same period they were ordered; actual lead time = 0 (matches carry-over insight). Inventory & demand: on-hand = 22, in-transit = 0, but with L=0 any order placed now will arrive this period and can meet Period 47 demand. Recent demand regime: Periods 40\u201346 show a sustained seasonal peak (weekly sold around 340\u2013360), so expected single-period demand remains well above long-run historical mean. OR recommendation = 327 (uses long-run history and promised L); this is slightly below the recent peak-week demand (\u2248350\u2013360). Risk trade-offs: profit $4 vs holding $1 implies critical fractile 0.8 (z\u22480.84) so it's appropriate to carry safety stock during the seasonal peak; since lead time = 0 we can avoid long pipeline risk and size the order to cover one high-demand week without tying up too much inventory. Final strategy: increase OR's capped recommendation from 327 to 360 units to align with recent observed peak-week demand and avoid stockouts this holiday week, while accepting modest extra holding cost given high lost-sales risk if understocked. Order will arrive same period and combine with 22 on-hand for immediate availability.",
