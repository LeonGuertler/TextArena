Pipeline (367) is far short of the expected 5-period demand (~1183), so additional ordering is warranted to cover upcoming periods. Decision logic: Follow OR's capped, conservative recommendation (352) because it already accounts for the multi-period demand and applies a cap to avoid overordering given pipeline uncertainty; this balances service (profit per unit $4) against holding cost ($1). I avoid a much larger order because (a) current in-transit may still arrive and (b) lost-shipment risk makes aggressive topping-up costly. Action: order 352 units for SKU 464297007.",
