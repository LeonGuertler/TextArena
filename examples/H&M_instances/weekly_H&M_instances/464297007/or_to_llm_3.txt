{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: concluded history consistently shows actual lead time = 4 periods (Period1 arrival in Period5 etc.), so use L=4. Inventory & demand analysis: empirical single-period mean \u03bc\u0304 = 236.6 (from provided samples [267,298,307,189,122]); \u03c3\u0304 \u224879.1. For review+lead (1+L=5): \u03bc\u0302 = 5\xd7236.6 = 1,183; \u03c3\u0302 = \u221a5\xd779.1 \u2248 176.9. Critical fractile q = profit/(profit+holding) = 2/(2+1)=0.6667 \u2192 z*\u22480.43. Base-stock = \u03bc\u0302 + z*\u03c3\u0302 \u2248 1,183 + 0.43\xd7176.9 \u2248 1,259. Current observed inventory: on-hand 0 + in-transit 911 = pipeline 911. Uncapped order needed = base_stock \u2212 pipeline \u2248 1,259 \u2212 911 = 348 units. OR recommended 440 (uses promised L and same stats but applies a cap); I reduce to 348 because actual lead time confirmed =4 and pipeline shortfall to base_stock is ~348. Ordering 348 brings pipeline to target base_stock \u22481,259, balancing stockout risk (given high 5-period demand ~1,183) against holding cost $1/unit/period. Action timing note: this order will arrive in Period 51 (N+4) and won't be visible until Period 52 conclude.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Reduced OR's 440 to 348 units \u2014 actual lead time = 4 and current pipeline (911) is 348 units below the calculated base-stock (~1,259), so order 348 to restore target coverage for the 5-period demand.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Period47: actual lead time remains confirmed = 4 periods; pipeline (on-hand 0 + in-transit 911) = 911, which is ~348 units below base_stock \u22481,259 (5-period demand coverage).",
