{
  "rationale": "Context & objectives: promised LT=2 but historical concludes show variable LT (1\u20133) and unreliable arrivals; recent demand regime is high (~338\u2013360 units per period, sustained P40\u2013P45). Inventory position: on-hand=0, in-transit=1066. Required coverage: with L=2 we must cover (L+1)=3 periods. Demand outlook: use recent regime mean \u2248338\u2013360 \u2192 need ~1,014\u20131,080 units to cover 3 periods. In-transit 1,066 \u2248 meets the 3-period coverage (1,066 vs required ~1,050). Risk of delays/loss: arrivals have been unreliable but several recent large demands with no concludes suggests shipments in-transit may still arrive; ordering now would arrive after 2 periods (and possibly later), risking excess holding if shipments do arrive promptly. OR recommended 0 (uses promised LT and historical data). Decision: follow OR and order 0 units. This avoids over-ordering given large in-transit that already roughly covers 3 periods of elevated demand and holding cost is nontrivial ($1/unit/period). If multiple consecutive conclude messages show in-transit units not arriving (confirming losses), I will revise and place replacement orders in future periods.",
