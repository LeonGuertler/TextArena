{

Inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we have no cover for this period. Demand outlook: recent weeks (Periods 44\u201346) show very high realized demand (~380, 360, 358) and toppings of ~300+ across the year; OR's base-stock/cap recommendation = 349 uses historical demand and the profit/holding fractile (q=4/(4+1)=0.8). Given confirmed LT=0 and strong recent demand, the OR quantity is appropriate to meet expected demand while keeping moderate safety stock. I will follow OR's capped recommendation of 349 units to avoid stockouts this period while limiting holding cost.",
