{
  "rationale": "History shows actual lead times have often been 3 (not the promised 2) and some long delays/losses have occurred, but current in-transit = 948 units. Using the provided past-demand samples (mean \u2248236.6 units/period), (L+1)=3 periods of protection \u2248 710 units. Pipeline (948) comfortably covers ~3 periods of expected demand even if lead time =3 and demand remains near historical mean.
