Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11 (Period 1). SKU is women's thong underwear; short-term demand may rise slightly for Valentine\u2019s Day (2019-02-14) but historical samples [267,298,307,189,122] show mean demand ~236. No on-hand or in-transit inventory and no concluded arrivals to infer actual lead time. I choose default lead time (use promised L=4) and default demand/volatility calculations so the OR engine uses the full-sample mean and std scaled by (1+L). This is conservative but lets the backend account for uncertainty; if imminent Valentine uplift proves material, future periods will switch to a recent/EWMA update once evidence appears in concluded demand.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-02-18. Historical sample demands = [267,298,307,189,122]; Period 1 concluded: ordered=367 arrived=0 (order in-transit). Promised lead time = 4; no concluded arrivals yet beyond what promised implies, so no evidence to alter lead-time. Use default lead time to match supplier promise. Demand appears variable but no strong recent regime shift (Period1 demand=159 is a single low sample); therefore use default demand statistics ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and default volatility (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) so the OR backend applies its base-stock calculation consistently while covering L+1 periods of demand given current in-transit units.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). On-hand=0, in-transit=719; two recent orders (Periods 1\u20132) have not concluded/arrived yet. No concluded arrivals -> cannot infer actual lead time; use promised lead time. Historical demand samples = [267,298,307,189,122] show mean ~236.6 and moderate variance; no clear changepoint in demand series. To protect service given large pipeline uncertainty and promised L=4, use default methods so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std, letting the OR engine set base stock and cap using its loss/service tradeoff. This balances filling 5-period demand against holding cost while flagging that missing concludes may indicate delayed/lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Large outstanding in-transit quantity (719) with no concluded arrivals for orders placed in Periods 1\u20132; possible shipment delays or losses\u2014monitor for future conclude entries.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04 (Period 4). On-hand 0, in-transit 1113 (matches orders placed in Periods 1-3). Promised lead time = 4 and no concluded arrivals are expected yet (orders placed so far would arrive later under promised LT), so no evidence to change LT. Historical demand samples = [267,298,307,189,122], mean ~236.6. I choose default methods so the OR engine uses promised L and full-sample statistics: L=default to respect promised lead time; mu_hat=default to set (1+L)*mean of all samples (captures overall demand level); sigma_hat=default to use sqrt(1+L)*std of all samples (captures observed volatility). This keeps ordering conservative given large pipeline and no confirmed delays.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of 2019-03-11 (Period 5) on-hand=0, in-transit=1343. Historical concludes show zero arrivals for orders placed in Periods 1\u20134 (orders 367,352,394,230 \u2014 no arrivals yet), indicating shipments are delayed or lost. To be conservative I explicitly increase lead time to reflect prolonged non-arrival and avoid over-confidence in on-time delivery. I set L explicitly > promised to force the OR engine to hold more pipeline cover. Demand has softened recently (last three samples 307,189,122); I use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the forecast and volatility reflect the more recent lower regime and reduce target base stock. These choices trade lower holding risk from a downward demand shift while protecting service given uncertain deliveries.

Carry-over insight: Prolonged non-arrival for orders placed in Periods 1\u20134 (orders 367,352,394,230) \u2014 no concluded arrivals through Period 4; treat as an ongoing delayed/lost shipment regime and expect effective lead time > promised (evidence: four consecutive conclude messages with arrived=0).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). On-hand=117, in-transit=1375. History shows four periods of non-arrivals then Period 5 conclude: arrived=367 (ordered Period 1, lead_time=4) \u2014 this confirms at least one order experienced a 4-period lead time (matches promised). Given the confirmed lead-time evidence and stable historical demand (samples [267,298,307,189,122]), set L by calculating observed lead times to let the backend infer average actual L; use default demand/volatility calculations so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect all available samples over the (1+L) review+lead horizon. This balances service (capture summed demand over 5 periods) against holding cost given modest profit/h holding ratio.

Carry-over insight: Observed lead time confirmed = 4 periods (Period1 ordered arrived in Period5 \u2192 lead_time=4); treat lead time as at least 4 until contradictory conclude messages appear.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25): history shows concluded arrivals for orders placed in Periods 1\u20132 with lead_time=4 confirmed twice (orders from P1 arrived in P5, P2 arrived in P6). On-hand=253, in-transit=1023\u2014large pipeline. Given two consistent concluded lead-time observations, set L to the calculated average of observed lead times (4). Use default demand/volatility computations so the backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples; this leverages all historical samples [267,298,307,189,122] while the large pipeline reduces need for upward explicit forecasting. These settings balance service (higher base stock from L=4) against holding cost since pipeline is already substantial.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01): on-hand=394, in-transit=679. Recent conclude messages (Periods 5\u20137) confirm orders placed in Periods 1\u20133 arrived with lead_time=4, so actual lead time \u22484. Pipeline now contains arrivals from earlier delayed shipments; current inventory position is healthy but demand history shows variability. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times to capture confirmed L=4. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this balances service level (covering L+1 periods) against holding cost given the confirmed longer lead time and current pipeline.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-04-08 Period 9. On-hand=341, in-transit=699. Historical conclude messages show four confirmed lead_time=4 observations (orders from Periods 1\u20134 arrived after 4 periods). Pipeline is large but recent arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4; no fresh evidence of lost shipments. To align OR backend (which uses promised L but can average observed lead times) I choose L by calculating the average observed lead time (will be 4). Demand shows stable recent weekly sales ~216\u2013283; using default mu_hat and sigma_hat (all-sample statistics scaled by 1+L) lets the OR engine compute base-stock from full history and the confirmed lead time. This balances service (avoid stockouts given large pipeline and 4-period lead time) against holding cost by not manually inflating demand or variance without new evidence.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-04-15. Recent conclude history consistently shows orders arriving with lead_time=4 (Periods 5\u20139 arrivals trace to orders in Periods 1\u20135), so actual lead time is confirmed at 4. On-hand=564, in-transit=593 \u2192 healthy pipeline but arrivals are observed with one-period reporting delay. Demand in recent concluded periods: [250,216,253,283,176] (most recent 5); I use a recent-5 mean to capture the latest regime. Choices: L set to calculate so backend uses observed lead times (matches confirmed L=4); mu_hat recent_N N=5 to reflect recent demand pattern across the review+lead horizon; sigma_hat default to let backend compute volatility from all samples scaled for (1+L). This balances service (using recent demand to avoid stockouts) against holding cost given current ample inventory and confirmed stable lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-57.00

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent conclude messages consistently show arrivals with lead_time=4 (orders from Periods 1\u20135 arrived after 4 periods). On-hand=395, in-transit=680; pipeline is healthy but continue to treat shipments as 4-period lead. Demand has declined from early peaks; last 5 periods' demands = [216,253,283,176,169], indicating a lower recent mean. I set L by calculation to let the backend use observed lead-times. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to base the (1+L) demand forecast on the most recent regime (captures recent lower demand). I keep sigma_hat as default so the backend uses full-sample variability scaled by sqrt(1+L). These choices maintain service with L=4 while reducing target base-stock to reflect lower recent demand, balancing profit vs. holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed persistent lead time = 4 periods based on concluded arrivals (Period1\u21925, Period2\u21926, Period3\u21927, Period4\u21928, Period5\u21929); treat effective lead time as 4 until contradicted.

Pipeline is large but recent arrivals cleared earlier outstanding delays; no new contradictory evidence. Use 'calculate' for L to lock in observed lead-time regime. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, providing a stable baseline given limited sample size and confirmed lead time.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-05-06 Period 13. History shows consistent concluded arrivals with lead_time=4 for multiple orders (Periods 1\u21925,2\u21926,3\u21927,4\u21928,5\u21929,7\u219211,8\u219212) indicating a stable 4-period effective lead time. On-hand = 196, in-transit = 740 (large pipeline). Demand history shows typical weekly demand ~170\u2013323 with recent spikes (e.g. Period12 demand=323). To keep the OR engine aligned with observed stable lead time and use broad historical demand for robust estimates, set L to be inferred from observed lead times and use default demand/volatility aggregation so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This keeps service levels high given large pipeline and confirmed L=4 while letting the OR engine cap orders via its cap formula to limit over-ordering.

LLM Rationale:
Observed conclude history shows consistent actual lead time = 4 (multiple orders with lead_time=4). On-hand=367, in-transit=796 (large pipeline). Recent demand has softened vs earlier spikes; using the most recent 5 demand samples (Periods 9\u201313) captures current regime. Set L via calculation of observed lead times to reflect confirmed LT=4. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 demands, aligning stock with current demand level while accounting for the 4-period lead. Keep sigma_hat as default to reflect full-sample volatility scaled for the lead+review period.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-05-20 (Period 15). On-hand=303, in-transit=709. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 for multiple orders (Periods 1\u21925 through 10\u219214), indicating stable 4-period effective lead time and no new lost-shipment signal. Demand history samples = [267,298,307,189,122] (mean=236.6). I choose to infer lead time from observed concludes (calculate) to capture confirmed effective L=4, and use default demand aggregation so the OR backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples). This keeps the backend aligned with confirmed lead-time regime while relying on full-sample demand stats to balance service level vs holding cost.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03 (Period 17). Historical conclude messages consistently show observed lead time = 4 periods (multiple confirmed arrivals: ordered Periods 1\u21925,2\u21926,...,12\u219216). Current inventory: on-hand=292, in-transit=725. Evidence indicates no recent regime change in demand or lead time; shipments are arriving with 4-period lag. I therefore set L to be calculated from observed lead times (captures confirmed 4-period regime). For demand parameters I use defaults so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples \u2014 this balances service level targeting (via base-stock) against holding cost given stable demand history and confirmed lead time. No new sustained insights to carry over.

No new evidence of lead-time drift or demand regime change. Use calculated lead time from observed concludes to reflect confirmed effective LT=4. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples, which balances service level (profit vs. holding cost) given stable demand history and confirmed LT.

LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). Demand history shows repeated concluded arrivals with lead_time=4 across many periods; effective lead time is consistently 4. Current inventory: on-hand=206, in-transit=705 \u2014 ample pipeline but arrivals for recent orders will follow the confirmed 4-period pattern. No strong recent demand regime shift detected from available samples, so use the backend defaults which incorporate all samples and the promised lead time. Choosing default L lets the OR engine use promised lead time (matches observed lead_time=4); default mu_hat and sigma_hat let the engine compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, balancing service level and holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-06-24. On-hand=0, in-transit=776. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show effective lead time = 4 periods (no contradictory concludes); many past orders experienced 4-period lead times so use promised/default lead time. Recent demand shows a sharp uptick (last 5 demands: 171,200,154,281,556) with a large spike in Period 19; I treat this as a recent demand regime and use recent_N (N=5) to forecast mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine raises target inventory and acknowledges higher variability. This balances service (avoid lost sales given 4-period lead time and zero on-hand) against holding cost by letting the backend compute base_stock from the recent mean/volatility.

Demand prior samples (seed) mean=236.6 (samples: 267,298,307,189,122). Given stable confirmed lead time and no clear recent demand regime change, use the promised/default lead time and default demand estimators so the OR engine applies (1+L)\xd7sample mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7sample std. This keeps pipeline coverage for the (L+1) review+lead horizon and lets the OR backend cap orders using its cap formula while balancing $2 profit vs $1 holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019/7/15 Period23. On-hand=0, in-transit=1152; historical conclude messages consistently show lead_time=4 (many orders with arrived matching ordered from 4 periods prior). Recent demand has been volatile with several large spikes (e.g. demands 556, 341, 261 in recent concludes). I set L by calculating observed lead times to reflect confirmed effective lead_time=4. For mu_hat I use recent_N (N=5) to base the (1+L)\xd7mean forecast on the most recent demand regime and respond to recent high demand. sigma_hat uses default to capture overall observed volatility scaled for (1+L). This combination keeps base-stock responsive to recent demand while using confirmed lead-time evidence to avoid underordering given large in-transit and past lost/delayed shipments.

History of concluded arrivals shows a persistent lead time of 4 periods (multiple orders with lead_time=4). Current on-hand=0, in-transit=1342 \u2014 large pipeline but arrivals follow 4-period pattern. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses observed lead times (will be 4). Demand forecasts use default methods ((1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std) to let OR engine compute base stock and cap from the full sample set; this balances service level given confirmed LT=4 while avoiding ad-hoc adjustments to demand volatility.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Observed conclude history consistently shows lead_time = 4 periods for many cycles (Periods 1\u21925 through 20\u219224). On-hand=411 and in-transit=798 provide substantial coverage; pipeline behavior appears stable with occasional zero-arrival noise but overall arrivals match 4-period lead time. Use promised/default lead time to align with confirmed observations and let OR backend compute demand over review+lead using all samples. Default sigma lets backend use full-sample volatility; this balances service level (profit $2 vs holding $1) without manual overstocking given large pipeline.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods; pipeline shows In-transit=782 and On-hand=410 so total available = 1,192. Recent demand history (samples provided) shows moderate, stable weekly demand. To keep the OR engine aligned with observed operations and the promised lead time, I use the default lead time (promised=4). I also use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this leverages the full sample set and the confirmed LT=4. This balances service (use observed LT) versus holding cost by letting the OR engine calculate the base stock and cap using the full-sample estimates while recognizing our large current pipeline.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). Historic concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time = 4 periods for all observed orders (Period1\u21925 through Period22\u219226). Current on-hand=253 and in-transit=715; several past late/no-arrival events resolved as 4-period arrivals, so treat effective lead time as 4. Use L='calculate' to reflect observed lead-time average (all concluded W=4). For demand, use default aggregation so backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples): this leverages full sample history [267,298,307,189,122] while the confirmed LT=4 drives the review+lead multiplier. This conservative choice balances service (profit $2 vs holding $1) by letting OR backend compute target base-stock with the observed variability and confirmed lead time; avoids overfitting to short-term spikes and accounts for pipeline (in-transit=715) already present.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Historical conclude messages consistently show arrivals for orders placed in Period t arriving in Period t+4 (multiple confirmations across Periods 5\u201327). On-hand=492 and in-transit=587 currently; pipeline + on-hand provides coverage but demand history is variable. Given repeated confirmed lead_time=4 and no recent contradictory conclude, use the calculated lead time from observed concludes. Use default demand and volatility aggregation ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR backend applies the standard base-stock computation and cap; this balances the 2$/unit profit vs 1$/unit holding by letting the OR compute z* from profit ratio while accounting for the 4-period lead-time in mu/sigma inputs.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26 (Period 29). Historical conclude messages consistently show an effective lead time of 4 periods (many confirmed arrivals with W=4). Recent on-hand=394 and in-transit=826 (total pipeline=1,220). Demand seed samples mean=236.6 (samples provided). Pipeline roughly equals (1+L)*mean demand, so no abrupt regime change detected. I choose default methods (use promised lead time L=4 and population stats) so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std; this avoids overreacting to single-period noise and leverages confirmed lead-time evidence while keeping holding vs service tradeoff balanced.

Recent demand samples (provided history) show moderate weekly demand; no calendar spikes apparent for early September. Given confirmed LT=4 and plentiful pipeline, use promised/default lead time and default demand stats so OR backend uses full-sample mean/variance over the (1+L) review+lead horizon. This keeps orders conservative (covers 5 periods of demand) while letting backend cap orders using its cap formula to avoid over-ordering.

On-hand=400 and in-transit=782 (total pipeline 1,182) is ample today. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times (will equal 4 based on conclues) so the OR engine uses empirical LT. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from demand samples \u2014 this keeps the base-stock calibrated to historical demand while the calculated L captures the confirmed 4-period lead time.

Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple confirmed arrivals from orders placed 4 periods earlier). Pipeline and on-hand are healthy relative to recent demands. I choose L=default to reflect the promised lead time (4) which matches repeated observed lead-time =4. Use mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7sample mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7sample std from historical demand samples; this leverages the full sample set and the confirmed lead-time regime to balance service level vs holding cost.

History shows consistent concluded arrivals with lead_time=4 across many periods (Periods 1\u21925 through 28\u219232), and current on-hand=724 with in-transit=327 (pipeline=1051). Given repeated confirmation of a 4-period effective lead time and ample pipeline covering multiple review+lead periods, I keep L at the promised/default value (4). I use default demand and volatility calculations so the OR engine uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all historical samples; this balances service (confirmed L=4) with holding cost given already-large on-hand inventory and high pipeline, avoiding aggressive additional build-up.

Current inventory: on-hand=112, in-transit=435 (total pipeline=547). Given repeated, stable 4-period lead-time observations and no new contradictory concludes, set lead time inference to be computed from observed lead times. Use default demand estimator for stability (no clear sustained regime shift despite recent high single-period demand spike) so the backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean of samples; use default volatility estimate. This keeps orders conservative while leveraging the confirmed LT=4 and avoids overreacting to one large recent demand value.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-14 Period 36. On-hand=0, large in-transit=1139. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show effective lead time = 4 periods (multiple matches Period t \u2192 t+4). Recent demand samples (seeded history) show moderate variability. To keep OR engine aligned with observed stable LT and use broad sample demand, I select promised/default lead time and default demand/volatility calculations so backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over all samples. This yields conservative ordering that leverages the large in-transit pipeline while preserving service level given profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21 (Period 37). On-hand=0, in-transit=1262. Historical conclude messages consistently show arrivals with lead_time=4 across many periods, so effective lead time is stable. Use L='calculate' to let backend average observed lead times (will be 4). Demand seed samples mean=236.6 (samples provided) -> with L=4 the default mu_hat = (1+L)*mean captures the review+lead demand; default sigma_hat uses all samples scaled by sqrt(1+L). These settings align the OR engine with the observed 4-period lead time and the historical demand seed while avoiding overreacting to transient fluctuations; they ensure pipeline coverage of (L+1) periods given the large in-transit volume.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed effective lead time = 4 through Period 36 based on consecutive concluded arrivals mapping orders to arrivals with W=4 (consistent across many periods); treat lead time as 4 until contradicted.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28): on-hand=64, in-transit=1115. Concluded arrivals through Period 37 consistently map orders \u2192 arrivals with lead_time=4, so effective lead time = 4. Demand history (seed) shows mean ~236.6 from provided samples; no clear recent demand regime shift or calendar spike to justify deviating from defaults. I therefore use the backend defaults so the OR engine computes base_stock using promised L and the full-sample mean/variance ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This keeps service level aligned with observed 4-period lead time while avoiding overreacting to transient in-transit fluctuations.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/4 (Period 39). Historical concludes show a persistent effective lead time = 4 periods through Period 38 (multiple orders consistently arrived with W=4). Current inventory: on-hand=395, in-transit=779 (total pipeline 1,174). Given confirmed LT=4 and ample pipeline covering (L+1) demand, use promised/default lead time so OR backend uses L=4. No clear recent demand regime shift in the provided history; use default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean of samples) and default volatility to let the backend compute base-stock and cap. This balances service (maintain coverage for 5 periods) while avoiding manual over-adjustment given stable LT evidence and substantial pipeline.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). Lead time has been consistently confirmed as 4 periods in concluded history through Period 39 (many mappings show W=4). On-hand=602, in-transit=432; pipeline looks healthy but lead time remains 4 so forecast horizon = 1+L = 5 periods. I select default methods so the OR engine uses the full historical sample statistics with L=promised (4) to produce a base-stock that balances the $2 profit vs $1 holding cost.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=395, in-transit=493. Concluded arrivals consistently map orders \u2192 arrivals with lead_time=4 across many periods (no contradictory conclude messages); use promised lead time. Recent realized demand has been elevated/variable (last several weeks higher than early-season baseline), so I bias forecasts to the recent regime. Set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the latest demand level; set sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to reflect recent volatility. This keeps service high during current elevated demand while containing extra safety stock via a recent-data volatility estimate, balancing $2 profit vs $1 holding cost.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). Recent conclude history consistently shows arrivals mapping to orders with lead_time=4 across many periods; treat effective lead time = promised 4. On-hand=88, in-transit=649. Historical demand samples = [267,298,307,189,122] (seed data) and long-run concluded demands confirm stable lead-time/demand regime. To keep the OR engine aligned with observed operations and leverage its historical-statistics calculations, use default methods so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std with L=promised. This balances service level (use confirmed L=4) against holding cost using the backend's capped policy.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). Demand history shows stable behavior with confirmed concluded arrivals mapping orders\u2192arrivals with lead_time=4 across many periods (Periods 5\u201342 confirms). On-hand=0, in-transit=979 (large pipeline). Given consistent evidence and promised lead time=4, set L to default (use promised). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this leverages full historical demand while the large in-transit pipeline reduces need for aggressive up-weighting. This balances service (maintain coverage over review+lead) versus holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

Carry-over insight: Effective lead time = 4 periods confirmed through Period 42 by consecutive concluded arrivals mapping orders to arrivals with W=4; treat lead time as 4 until contradicted.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=0, in-transit=1211 (large pipeline). Given stable observed lead time and ample pipeline, use promised/default lead time and default demand estimates so backend uses full history for (1+L)-period demand and volatility. This keeps the OR base-stock anchored to long-run demand while the large in-transit reduces near-term ordering risk.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent concluded history shows a persistent effective lead time of 4 periods (many consecutive order\u2192arrival mappings with W=4 through Period 44). On-hand=0 but large in-transit=1073; pipeline appears healthy but demand in recent weeks has been elevated (~300s). To respect confirmed lead time while reacting to the recent demand regime, keep L = promised (use default) and set demand forecast using the most recent 5 demand observations to capture the current level. Keep sigma_hat at default to let the OR engine use full-sample variability scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances higher service level for elevated recent demand against holding cost given significant pipeline inventory.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (Period 46). Historical conclude messages show a stable effective lead time = 4 across many periods; recent pipeline large (in-transit=1415) and on-hand=0. Use promised/default lead time to reflect confirmed L=4. Demand history seed (samples provided) shows modest mean/variance; no clear recent changepoint in demand series provided, so use default calculations for mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR engine forms a base-stock that balances profit ($2) vs holding cost ($1). This keeps orders conservative given the very large in-transit pipeline and confirmed 4-period lead time.

No new missed arrivals or lead-time shifts observed. Demand history shows no recent regime change requiring adjustment. To let the OR engine use its calibrated statistics (and because promised lead time = observed lead time = 4), use defaults so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the full sample set. This keeps service levels aligned with observed variability while avoiding manual overreaction to pipeline noise.
