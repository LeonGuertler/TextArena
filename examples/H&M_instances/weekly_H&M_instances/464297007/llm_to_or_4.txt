Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. No on-hand or in-transit inventory; historical demands = [267,298,307,189,122] (mean=236.6, std\u224879.12). No calendar/event signals provided for Feb; no evidence of recent demand regime change or delayed arrivals. Use promised lead time (0) because no concluded arrivals exist to infer a different L. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using defaults so the OR engine uses full-sample demand estimates: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean captures expected demand over the review+lead period; sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std captures observed variability. These parameters balance service (using sample mean) against holding cost by reflecting current profit/holding ratio via the OR backend's z* calculation.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. One concluded arrival shows orders placed in Period 1 arrived with lead_time=0, so no evidence of lead-time drift or lost shipments. Historical demand samples = [267,298,307,189,122] (mean=236.6, std\u224870.78). On-hand=112, in-transit=0; given profit=$2 and holding=$1, target service quantile q = 2/(2+1)=0.6667 so OR will set base-stock above mean; we provide unbiased demand moments and L=0 so the OR engine can compute base_stock and its cap. Methods: use observed lead-time average (0); use default aggregate historical mean scaled by (1+L) for mu_hat; use default aggregate std scaled by sqrt(1+L) for sigma_hat. These parameters keep replenishment responsive (L=0), reflect current demand variability, and avoid excess inventory given moderate holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $516.00

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Concluded lead-times in history are 0 (Period1 and Period2 arrivals had lead_time=0). Demand history shows a recent high demand (373 in Period2) so I upweight recent observations via an EWMA to capture a possible upward shift while keeping lead-time = 0. L set to average observed lead times (0). mu_hat uses EWMA (gamma=0.3) over available demands [267,298,307,189,122,159,373] => EWMA\u2248251.22 units (covers review+lead period since L=0). sigma_hat uses default: sample std of all observed demands \u224890.54 (scaled by sqrt(1+L)=1). These parameters balance higher recent demand (raise base-stock) versus holding cost by not overreacting to a single spike.

Carry-over insight: Recent demand spike: Period2 demand=373 vs historical mean ~236.6; EWMA (gamma=0.3) -> current demand signal \u2248251.2, monitor for persistence.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent data show a demand spike (Period2=373) but concluded lead times have been consistently 0 (Periods1-3 arrivals all report lead_time=0). I keep L at 0 (calculate avg observed lead time = 0) to reflect observed fast replenishment. For demand I emphasize the recent uptick using EWMA (gamma=0.3) which matches the prior period insight (EWMA \u2248251.2) to be responsive without overreacting to a single spike; mu_hat = (1+L)*EWMA -> 251.2 units. Volatility is set to the default using all historical samples to avoid overfitting the single spike: sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples) \u224870.78. These choices keep the base-stock responsive (higher mean from EWMA) while using broad historical variability for safety, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

Daily Reward (R_t): $493.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/11. Recent demand has risen vs older baseline (recent periods: 159, 373, 301, 278). All concluded orders show lead_time=0 historically, so no lead-time change. I treat the last 4 periods as a new demand regime (changepoint at Period 2 spike) and set parameters to reflect the higher recent mean while keeping volatility from the same window. This gives the OR engine a base-stock that protects service versus holding cost without overreacting to a single spike.

Carry-over insight: New sustained demand regime: recent 4-period mean \u2248277.75 (periods 1-4 demands: 159,373,301,278); lead_time observed = 0 in all concluded orders.

Daily Reward (R_t): $433.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. On-hand=67, in-transit=0. All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 (Periods 1-5 concluded), so actual lead time remains 0. Recent demand has shifted up: last 4 demands (Periods 2-5) = [373,301,278,250], mean=300.5, std\u224845.59. I set L to the observed average lead time (0) to match concluded evidence. I set mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the new higher demand regime (mu_hat=(1+L)*mean_last4=300.5). I set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4) to reflect current volatility (sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std_last4 \u224845.59). These parameters raise the base-stock to meet the elevated demand while keeping safety stock aligned with observed variability; using recent data avoids overreacting to the older low value (Period 1=159).

Carry-over insight: Confirmed lead_time=0 across concluded Periods 1-5; new demand regime detected \u2014 recent 4-period mean (Periods 2-5) = 300.5, std \u224845.59.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). Recent concluded history (Periods 2-6) shows all orders arriving same period \u2192 actual lead_time = 0. On-hand=108, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments. Demand has shown a recent regime but Period 6 dropped (216) vs prior higher values; to be responsive I use a short recent window (last 4 concluded demands: Periods 3-6 = [301,278,250,216]) to capture the most recent trend. Set L=0 (explicit) because all concluded orders show lead_time=0. Set mu_hat using recent_N (N=4): (1+L)*mean(last 4) = 261.25 to target current demand level while limiting overstock. Set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4): sqrt(1+L)*sample_std(last 4) = 36.67 to reflect observed volatility. These parameters keep reorder targets aligned with the most recent demand regime and leverage the confirmed zero lead time to minimize pipeline risk and holding costs.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Concluded history shows all arrived orders had lead_time=0 (Periods 1-7), so actual lead time remains 0. Recent demand has settled below earlier spike; last 4 realized demands (Periods 4-7: 278,250,216,253) show a recent regime with mean ~249.25 and std ~25.48. To be responsive to the recent regime while keeping safety low (profit $2 vs holding $1 implies moderate service target), I use L estimated from observed lead times (calculate \u2192 0), and demand estimates based on the most recent regime (recent_N with N=4) so mu_hat = (1+L)*recent_mean and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*recent_std. This keeps orders aligned with current demand and avoids excess holding given confirmed zero lead time and no in-transit stock.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08 (Period 9). Concluded history (Periods 1-8) shows all orders arrived with lead_time=0 \u2014 strong evidence actual lead time = 0. Recent demand has settled into a new regime: last 4-period demands (Periods 5-8 = 250,216,253,283) mean = 250.5, std \u2248 23.74. I use L=calculate (avg observed lead times = 0) to reflect confirmed same-period arrivals. For demand I use recent_N with N=4 to capture the new regime (most recent stable window) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last4)=250.5. For sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=4 so sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(last4)=23.737 (std computed on the 4 samples). These parameters keep target base-stock aligned to the new lower-variance regime and exploit certain same-period replenishment to minimize holding while preserving service.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15. On-hand=87, in-transit=0. Historical concluded demands (Periods1-9) mean=254.33, std\u224865.82. All concluded orders through Period9 show lead_time=0 (consistent same-day arrivals). No evidence of lost shipments. I choose L=default(promised)=0 to reflect repeated confirmed same-period arrivals. I set mu_hat using default=(1+L)*mean_all_samples \u2192 254.333 to target typical demand over the review+lead window. I set sigma_hat using default=sqrt(1+L)*std_all_samples \u2192 65.82 to capture observed volatility; this balances service level (reduce stockouts given observed demand swings) against holding cost given slim profit/holding ratio.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead_time=0 through concluded Periods 1-9 (evidence: arrived messages in Periods1-9 all show lead_time=0).

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent concluded history (Periods 1-10) consistently shows arrivals with lead_time=0; use L=0. Demand has softened in the last 4 periods (Periods 7-10 demands: 253,283,176,169) versus earlier spikes, so I use a recent_N demand estimate (N=4) to capture the current regime. mu_hat set to the 4-period mean (1+L)*mean = 220.25 units. Volatility estimated from the same recent window (std \u224848.97) scaled by sqrt(1+L). These parameters keep target base-stock responsive to the recent drop in demand while preserving service given immediate arrivals (L=0) and avoid excess holding costs.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29. On-hand=69, in-transit=0. Concluded history confirms actual lead_time=0 through Period 11. Recent demand has fallen from the earlier high regime; last 4 concluded demands (Periods 8-11 = 261,176,169,176) have mean 195.5 and sample std \u224843.79. To avoid excess holding cost given current on-hand, use L=0 (promised), set mu_hat from the recent 4-period mean (captures the latest lower-demand regime), and sigma_hat from the recent 4-period sample std to reflect current volatility. These parameters lower target base-stock vs. the earlier high-demand regime, reducing expected ending inventory while maintaining service against recent demand variability.

Carry-over insight: New downward demand regime: recent 4-period mean (Periods 8-11) = 195.5, sample std \u224843.79; confirmed actual lead_time=0 through Period 11.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). Concluded history shows consistent actual lead_time=0 through Period 12; on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent demand shows a large spike in Period 12 (323) after a softer run in Periods 9-11 (176,169,176). I treat this as uncertain (possible one-off spike) but must react to recent observations. Therefore I set L using concluded behavior (method=default \u2192 promised lead time = 0). For demand I use a recent_N=4 window (Periods 9-12) to capture the most recent regime including the spike: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last4)=211.0 units. For volatility I use recent_N=4 sample std to reflect increased variability (sigma_hat \u2248 74.77). These parameters keep target stock responsive to the Period 12 surge while recognizing lead time=0, balancing service (higher mu_hat) against holding cost via the backend's z-based cap.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Concluded history through Period 13 shows all arrivals had lead_time=0; on-hand=122, in-transit=0. Recent demand appears in a lower regime vs earlier spike; I use the most recent 4 periods (Periods 10-13 demands = [169,176,323,122]) to estimate demand for the (1+L) review+lead window. This keeps the forecast responsive to the recent downward signal while preserving some coverage for the single-period lead. The chosen params (L=0, mu_hat based on recent 4-period mean, sigma_hat based on recent 4-period std) balance service level against holding cost by sizing base_stock to recent demand and measured volatility.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Observed concluded arrivals through Period 14 show lead_time=0 consistently. Recent demand has fallen vs earlier surge; last 4 concluded-period demands (Periods 11-14 = 176,323,122,151) give a mean 193.0 and elevated volatility. I set L by averaging observed lead times (confirmed 0). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the current downward regime so the OR backend targets service for the next (1+L) period while avoiding excess holding cost. This keeps base-stock responsive to the new lower mean and higher short-term volatility.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead_time=0 through Period 14 (arrived messages Periods1-14 show lead_time=0); new downward demand regime detected \u2014 recent 4-period mean (Periods 11-14)=193.0, sample std\u224889.44.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/27 (Period 16). History shows concluded arrivals for Periods 1\u201315 all report lead_time=0 \u2192 actual lead time reliably 0. On-hand=61, in-transit=0 so we must order to cover expected upcoming demand. Recent downward demand regime detected (Periods 11\u201314 mean=193.0, std\u224889.44). To balance service vs holding cost (profit $2, holding $1 \u2192 q=2/(2+1)=0.6667 implying moderate service target) use the confirmed lead time=0 and recent 4-period demand regime to set forecast and variability so OR backend builds a base-stock reflecting the lower recent demand while preserving service. Parameters chosen: L = average observed lead time (0); mu_hat = recent 4-period (Periods 11\u201314) mean \xd7 (1+L) = 193.0; sigma_hat = recent 4-period sample std \xd7 sqrt(1+L) = 89.44.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03 (Period 17). Concluded history through Period 16 shows all arrivals with lead_time=0 (consistent and reliable). Recent demand has shifted downward: last 4 demands (Periods 13-16) = [122,151,171,200], mean=161.0, sample std\u224832.87. On-hand=31, in-transit=0 so we must replenish for (1+L) review+lead demand. I therefore set L by averaging observed lead times (confirmed 0). For demand I use recent_N (N=4) to capture the new lower regime and reduce forecast bias from earlier higher demands. Sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=4) sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). These choices keep base-stock responsive to the new lower demand while maintaining service with lead_time=0 and limiting holding cost exposure.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed lead_time=0 through Period 16 (arrived messages Periods1-16 show lead_time=0); new sustained downward demand regime (Periods 13-16 mean=161.0, sample std\u224832.87).

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10 (Period 18). All concluded arrivals through Period 17 show lead_time=0. On-hand=22, in-transit=0. Recent demand has moved down from earlier spikes; last 4 demands (Periods 14-17 = 151,171,200,154) have mean 169.0 and low dispersion (sample std \u224822.46). To avoid excess holding cost while maintaining service (profit/holding -> q=0.667 implies high service level), I use the confirmed lead_time=0 and a recent-4 demand estimate so the OR backend targets the current lower-demand regime and keeps inventory lean given limited on-hand stock and zero pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead_time=0 through Period 17 (arrived messages Periods1-17 show lead_time=0); new recent downward demand regime: Periods 14-17 mean=169.0, sample std\u224822.46.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-17 Period19. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Concluded history shows all arrivals with lead_time=0 through Period18, so actual lead time remains 0. Recent demand evidence indicates a cooler but variable regime: last 4 concluded demands (Periods15-18) = [171,200,154,281], mean=201.5, sample std\u224856.31. I choose L by confirmed observations (method=calculate \u2192 average observed lead times=0). For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=4) to capture the latest regime without over-weighting older data: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_recent = 201.5. For volatility I use recent_N (N=4) sample std scaled by sqrt(1+L): sigma_hat = 56.31. These settings keep base-stock responsive to the recent uptick in variability (protect service) while L=0 avoids needless safety for lead-time risk.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead_time=0 through Period 18 (arrived messages Periods1-18 show lead_time=0); updated recent 4-period demand (Periods15-18) mean=201.5, sample std\u224856.31.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/24 (Period 20). History shows every concluded order through Period 19 arrived with lead_time=0 (consistent, no lost shipments). Recent demand has a large upward outlier in Period 19 (demand=556) vs earlier periods. I treat lead time as 0 (calculate average of observed lead times = 0). For demand I detect a recent regime shift driven by the last 4 periods (Periods 16-19: demands 200,154,281,556) and use recent_N=4 to capture the current higher mean and elevated volatility. mu_hat set to (1+L)*mean_recent = 297.75 to supply expected single-period demand; sigma_hat set to sqrt(1+L)*sample_std_recent = 179.94 to reflect increased uncertainty from the Period 19 spike. These parameters raise the base-stock and the cap (via sigma) to improve service against the recent large demand spike while acknowledging holding cost through the OR cap.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead_time=0 through Period 19 (arrivals in Periods1-19 show lead_time=0); recent large demand spike in Period 19 (demand=556) shifted the recent 4-period mean to 297.75 and sample std to ~179.94 \u2014 monitor persistence.

Date 2019-07-01 (Period 21). Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead_time=0 through Period 20. Recent large spike in Period 19 (d=556) has lifted short-run demand \u2014 I treat this as a potential new regime and therefore use a recent-window forecast. On-hand=115, in-transit=0, so current coverage is below the recent expected 1-period demand (~313); choosing L=0 (promised & confirmed) and recent_N=4 demand estimate (Periods 17-20) to capture the latest regime while keeping responsiveness high. This increases mu_hat to cover the elevated short-run mean and sets sigma_hat from the same 4-sample volatility so the OR backend will raise the base-stock and the cap appropriately to balance service level versus holding cost.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 22 (2019-07-08) concluded history shows every concluded arrival through Period 21 had lead_time=0; no in-transit stock. Recent demand shows a volatile uptick driven by a large spike in Period 19 (556). I treat lead time as 0 (confirmed). For demand I use a recent_N approach with N=4 (Periods 18-21 demands = [281,556,261,201]) to capture the current high-demand regime while keeping responsiveness to reversions. Chosen mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_recent = 324.75 units to stock for the review+lead period; sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*sample_std_recent = 157.92 to reflect high volatility. These parameters raise the base-stock to support service in the current high-demand regime (reducing lost sales given lead_time=0) while sigma captures uncertainty so the OR backend caps orders appropriately to limit overstock given holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead_time=0 through concluded Period 21 (arrivals in Periods1-21 show lead_time=0); recent 4-period demand (Periods18-21) mean=324.75, sample std\u2248157.92 \u2014 elevated by Period19 spike (556); monitor persistence.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Observed lead_time confirmed 0 across concluded Periods 1-22. Recent demand elevated driven by Period19 spike; using most recent 4 demands (Periods19-22: 556,261,201,341) to capture current regime. On-hand=52, in-transit=0 vs (1+L)-period demand ~340 \u2192 replenish to target. Choices: L set to observed average (0) to reflect timely arrivals; mu_hat set to recent_4 mean to respond to elevated demand; sigma_hat set to recent_4 sample std to reflect high volatility from the Period19 spike. These parameters raise the base-stock to improve service while sigma captures uncertainty to avoid extreme overstock.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead_time=0 through Period 22; new recent 4-period demand regime (Periods19-22) mean=339.75, sample std\u2248155.17 \u2014 elevated by Period19 spike (556); monitor persistence.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Lead time: concluded arrivals through Period 23 all show lead_time=0 so use L=0. Recent demand regime: last 4 observed demands (Periods 20-23 = 261,201,341,422) show elevated average vs longer history; use recent_N forecasting (N=4) to capture this shift and avoid stocking short during high demand. mu_hat set to (1+L)*recent_mean = 306.25. sigma_hat set to sqrt(1+L)*recent_sample_std \u224896.17 to reflect high recent volatility driven by the Period 23 spike. This raises the OR base-stock to improve service while capping orders prevents excess inventory given holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead_time=0 through Period 23 (arrivals in Periods1-23 show lead_time=0); recent 4-period demand (Periods20-23) mean=306.25, sample std\u224896.17 \u2014 elevated by recent spikes; monitor persistence.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29 (Period 25). Historical concluded lead_time=0 through Period 23; no overdue shipments. Recent 4-period demand (Periods20-23) shows elevated regime (mean=306.25, std\u224896.17) driven by recent spikes; on-hand=213, in-transit=0 so current stock covers ~0.7 periods of this recent demand. I set L to promised(0) since concluded history confirms 0. I use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new higher demand regime while keeping responsiveness to persistence. These parameters tell the OR engine to target a base stock around the recent mean and to inflate safety stock for the observed volatility, balancing service (profit=$2) vs holding cost ($1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $68.00

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). On-hand=198, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 consistently through Period 25, so actual LT remains 0. Recent demand has been volatile; last 4 concluded demands (Periods 22-25) = [341, 422, 135, 133], mean=257.75 and sample std\u2248146.68. I use L=0 (calculated from observed lead-times) and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the most recent regime and elevated volatility. This keeps target inventory responsive to recent spikes while limiting excess holding given holding cost=$1/unit and profit=$2/unit (service quantile q=2/(2+1)=0.6667 implicitly handled by OR).

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead_time=0 through Period 25 (arrivals in Periods1-25 all show lead_time=0); new recent 4-period demand regime (Periods22-25) mean=257.75, sample std\u2248146.68.

Recent demand regime chosen: last 4 concluded demands (Periods 23-26 = [422,135,133,339]) show mean=257.25 and sample std\u2248146.32. I set L to observed average (0) and use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current short-run regime and recent volatility; this keeps the base-stock responsive to spikes while limiting holding cost exposure.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Concluded arrivals through Period 27 confirm actual lead_time=0. Recent demand has moderated vs earlier spikes; I use a recent-4 estimate to capture the current regime (Periods 24-27 demands: 135,133,339,243 -> mean=212.5, std\u224898.76). Set L based on observed lead times=0 to keep orders arriving same period.

To react quickly to the recent regime while retaining responsiveness to spikes, set L=promised (0), mu_hat as recent_4 mean (covering review+lead =1 period), and sigma_hat from the same 4-sample window.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). Concluded history through Period 29 shows arrivals for all prior orders with lead_time=0 \u2014 strong evidence actual lead time = 0. Recent demand shows a downward regime: last 4 demands (Periods 26-29) = [339,243,100,124], mean = 201.5, sample std \u2248110.95. On-hand=127, in-transit=0. I choose L based on observed lead times (calculate avg observed = 0). Set mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the current post-spike regime: mu_hat = (1+L)*recent_mean = 201.5. Set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4) to reflect elevated variability after recent spikes: sigma_hat \u2248110.95. These parameters keep target stock aligned with the recent 4-period demand regime while recognizing high variability, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/9 (Period 31). On-hand=149, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead_time=0 through Period 30. Recent demand has trended down: last 4 realized demands (Periods 27-30) = [243,100,124,101], mean=142.0, sample std\u224868.27, indicating a lower recent regime versus earlier spikes (e.g., Period19=556). I therefore set L to the observed/promised 0. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to reflect the new lower demand regime and reduce overstock risk. These parameters bias orders toward maintaining service with lower average demand while capturing recent volatility; this balances profit per unit ($2) against $1 holding cost by reducing target base-stock relative to earlier higher-demand periods.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead_time=0 through Period 30 (arrivals in Periods1-30 show lead_time=0); new recent-4 demand regime (Periods27-30) mean=142.0, sample std\u224868.27.

Recent demand has trended down; last 4 demands (Periods 28-31) = [100,124,101,77], mean=100.5, sample std\u224819.19. Use promised lead time (0) since confirmed by concluded history. Set mu_hat using recent-4 to capture the new lower regime; sigma_hat from same recent-4 sample to reflect reduced volatility.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-23 (Period 33). On-hand=0, in-transit=0; concluded history confirms actual lead_time=0 through Period 32. Recent demand has shifted down: last 4 demands (Periods 29-32) = [124,101,77,194], mean=124.0, sample std\u224850.456. I set L to the promised/default (0) because concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=0. I set mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the new downward regime (mu_hat = (1+L)*recent_mean = 124.0). I set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4) to reflect current volatility (sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*sample_std \u224850.456). These parameters reduce target base-stock to avoid excess holding cost while preserving service given the confirmed zero lead time and lower recent demand.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead_time=0 through Period 32 (arrivals in Periods1-32 show lead_time=0); new recent 4-period downward demand regime (Periods29-32) mean=124.0, sample std\u224850.456.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
All concluded arrivals through Period 33 show lead_time=0. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish for same-period demand. No strong new calendar signal; recent volatility (large spikes in P19 and P33) exists but insufficient to declare a new sustained regime. Use promised lead time (0) and default demand estimators on full sample to let OR backend compute base-stock with available historical mean/variance.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-07 (Period 35). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=0 through Period 34 -> treat L as 0. Recent 4-period demand (Periods 31-34 = [77,194,692,335]) shows a large spike (692) raising the short-run mean and volatility; this looks like a recent regime shift but may be transient. To balance service (avoid stockouts with same-period arrivals) vs holding cost, I use a recent_N demand estimate (N=4) to capture the current elevated demand signal while keeping L=0 so orders can arrive same period. sigma_hat uses the same 4-sample window to reflect elevated uncertainty from the spike.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead_time=0 through Period 34 (arrivals in Periods1-34 show lead_time=0); recent 4-period demand (Periods31-34) mean=324.5, sample std\u2248266.77 driven by Period33 spike=692 \u2014 monitor persistence.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-14 (Period 36). Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead_time=0 through Period 35. Recent 4 demands (Periods 32-35 = [194,692,335,123]) give a short-term mean=336.0 but very high volatility driven by Period 33 spike (692). On-hand=317, in-transit=0 so we can meet near-term demand; maintain L=0 (observed). Use recent-4 demand to capture the current regime while reflecting high uncertainty so OR sets a higher base-stock for service. Sigma uses sample std of the same 4 observations to reflect elevated risk from spikes.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead_time=0 through Period 35 (arrivals in Periods1-35 show lead_time=0); recent-4 demand (Periods32-35) mean=336.0, sample std\u2248253.16 \u2014 elevated by Period33 spike (692); monitor persistence.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21 (Period 37). On-hand=346, in-transit=0. Concluded history shows every observed arrival had lead_time=0 \u2192 no evidence of transit delays or lost shipments. Recent demand shows a volatile regime driven by large spikes (Period33=692, Period35=123, Period36=100) \u2014 detect most recent changepoint and use the last 4 demands to capture current signal while reflecting high variance. Set L by averaging observed lead times (all 0). Set mu_hat using recent_4 mean to be responsive to the current level (N=4). Set sigma_hat using recent_4 sample std to capture elevated volatility from spikes; this increases the base-stock buffer without over-ordering long-term because lead time=0 and on-hand is already high. These parameters push the OR engine toward a moderate service level while controlling holding cost given Profit=$2 and Holding=$1 (q\u22480.667).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). Historical concludes show actual lead_time=0 in every concluded period through Period 37; on-hand=307, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments. Recent demand has settled lower after spikes: last 4 concluded demands (Periods 34-37) = [335,123,100,124], recent-4 mean=170.5, sample std\u2248110.22. I therefore (1) set L to the empirical average observed lead time (0) to match confirmed same-period arrivals, (2) use a recent-4 demand estimate for mu_hat to capture the current lower-demand regime, and (3) use recent-4 sample std for sigma_hat to reflect elevated variability from a prior spike but current lower mean. These parameters keep the OR base-stock responsive to the recent low-demand regime while retaining volatility to avoid stockouts given same-period replenishment.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead_time=0 through Period 37 (arrivals in Periods1-37 show lead_time=0); new recent-4 lower-demand regime (Periods34-37) mean=170.5, sample std\u2248110.22.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). History shows consistent same-period arrivals through Period 38 (no lost shipments). Recent demand has fallen: last 4 demands (Periods 35-38) = [123,100,124,115], mean=115.5, std\u224811.09. I set L by averaging observed lead times (calculate) => 0 (consistent with concluded arrivals). For demand I use recent_N (N=4) to capture the new lower-demand regime: mu_hat = (1+L)*recent_mean = 115.5. For volatility I use recent_N (N=4): sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*sample_std \u2248 11.09. These parameters shrink target base-stock to the new low-demand regime while keeping L=0 to allow same-period replenishment and avoid overstocking given $1 holding cost vs $2 profit.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead_time=0 through concluded Period 38 (arrivals in Periods1-38 show lead_time=0); new recent-4 downward demand regime (Periods35-38) mean=115.5, sample std\u224811.09.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). Concluded history confirms actual lead_time=0 through Period 39. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must cover current-period demand. Recent demand has dropped vs earlier spikes: last 4 concluded demands (Periods 36-39) = [100,124,115,241], mean=145.0, sample std\u224864.77. I set L=0 (confirmed), use recent_N=4 for mu_hat to respond to the latest regime, and recent_N=4 for sigma_hat to capture current volatility. This keeps base_stock responsive to the recent lower-demand regime while preserving safety for the single-period horizon.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead_time=0 through Period 39; new recent-4 demand regime (Periods36-39) mean=145.0, sample std\u224864.77.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18. Concluded history shows all arrivals through Period 40 had lead_time=0 (no lost shipments); on-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must cover current-period demand. Recent demand is volatile with a large Period 40 spike (387) \u2014 use a short recent window to capture current regime while avoiding overreacting to single outlier. Set L based on observed lead-times=0. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat from recent 4 periods (Periods 37-40 demands = [124,115,241,387]) to reflect current mean and elevated variance so the OR backend increases target stock to preserve service during spike but bounded by its cap.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead_time=0 through Period 40 (arrivals in Periods1-40 all show lead_time=0); recent 4-period demand (Periods37-40) mean=216.75, sample std\u2248127.19 driven by Period40 spike=387 \u2014 monitor persistence.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/25 (Period 42). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Concluded history shows all arrivals through Period 41 had lead_time=0, so actual lead time remains 0. Recent demand (last 4 concluded periods 38-41 = [115,241,387,348]) shows an elevated mean with volatility after recent spikes. To balance service vs holding cost I use a short recent-window forecast to capture the current regime while keeping L=0 (observed). Parameters set to cover (1+L) periods of demand and reflect recent variance so the OR backend's base-stock and cap calculations respond to the recent demand level and increased uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead_time=0 through Period 41 (arrivals in Periods1-41 show lead_time=0); new recent-4 demand mean (Periods38-41)=272.75, sample std\u2248121.95.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). All concluded arrivals through Period 42 show lead_time=0 (consistent recent history). Recent demand has been elevated: last 4 concluded demands (Periods 39-42) = [241, 387, 348, 311], mean=321.75, sample std\u224862.13. With lead_time=0 we only need (1+L)=1 period coverage. I set L to the observed average (0) and use a recent_N=4 demand estimate to capture the current elevated regime while keeping volatility for safety. These parameters raise the backend base-stock to meet the recent higher demand spike while accounting for holding cost via the OR cap.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09 (Period 44). Concluded history shows actual lead_time=0 for all concluded orders through Period 43; on-hand=83, in-transit=0. Recent demand elevated: last 4 demands (Periods 40-43) = [387,348,311,266], mean=328.0, sample std\u224852.02. I set L to observed lead time=0 (recent average). I set mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the current elevated regime: mu_hat=(1+L)*recent_mean=328.0. I set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4): sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*sample_std\u224852.02. These choices keep the OR engine responsive to the recent higher demand while reflecting the confirmed zero lead time so orders arrive same period.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead_time=0 through Period 43 (arrivals in Periods1-43 show lead_time=0); new recent-4 demand regime (Periods40-43) mean=328.0, sample std\u224852.02 \u2014 elevated demand, monitor persistence.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16 (Period 45). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Concluded history confirms actual lead_time=0 through Period 44. Recent 4-period demand (Periods 41-44 = [348,311,266,380]) shows elevated demand vs long-run; mean=326.25, sample std\u224849.08. To match current high short-term demand while keeping model responsive, set L=default (promised=0) and use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets the recent elevated regime and limits stockouts this period while controlling holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead_time=0 through Period 44 (arrivals in Periods1-44 show lead_time=0); new recent-4 elevated demand regime (Periods41-44) mean=326.25, sample std\u224849.08.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (pre-Christmas) \u2014 recent sales remain elevated (Periods 42-45 demands = 311,266,380,360). On-hand=0, in-transit=0; concluded history confirms actual lead_time=0. To avoid stockouts during the holiday spike, I use a recent-4 demand estimate (captures the latest regime) and keep L=0. This raises the base-stock to meet short-term high demand while sigma reflects recent variability so the OR backend sets a higher safety stock but is still responsive to falling demand after the season.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead_time=0 through Period 45; recent 4-period demand (Periods 42-45) mean=329.25, sample std\u224851.17 (holiday-elevated demand).

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30 (holiday week) \u2014 recent history shows an elevated demand regime in the last 4 periods (Periods 43\u201346: demands 266,380,360,358) and all concluded arrivals indicate actual lead_time=0. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish to cover this elevated short-term demand. I set L using observed lead-times (calculate) => 0. I set mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the current holiday-elevated mean = 341 units for the (1+L) review+lead period. I set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture current volatility (sample std \u224850.98, scaled by sqrt(1+L)). These parameters prioritize service during confirmed holiday uplift while keeping holding risk explicit to the OR engine (profit $2 vs holding $1 gives a high target service level).

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead_time=0 through Period 46 (arrivals in Periods1-46 show lead_time=0); new recent 4-period elevated demand regime (Periods43-46 mean=341, sample std\u224850.98) \u2014 holiday-driven, monitor persistence.
