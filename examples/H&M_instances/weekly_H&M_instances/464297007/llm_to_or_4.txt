Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. No on-hand or in-transit inventory and no concluded arrivals to suggest lead-time deviations or lost shipments; historical demands = [267,298,307,189,122] show no clear recent regime change and no calendar spike around mid-February for this underwear SKU. Use promised lead time and default demand pooling: conservative base-stock computed from (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and default volatility so the OR engine balances service level vs holding cost without overreacting to limited data.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). On-hand=0, in-transit=367 (ordered in P1) but arrived=0 in P1 conclude so arrival still pending \u2014 no concluded arrivals to compute actual lead time. Use promised lead time (default L=2). Demand history available; no clear changepoint. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing a neutral forecast and volatility for the OR engine while we wait for confirmed arrivals.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/2/25 (Period 3). On-hand=0, in-transit=719 (367+352) and no concluded arrivals yet \u2014 consistent with promised lead time=2 given arrival visibility delay. Demand history samples = [267,298,307,189,122], mean=236.6, std\u224870.78. No clear changepoint; use promised/default lead time and default demand moments so OR backend applies (1+L) aggregation and appropriate safety stock. This balances service (cover 3 periods) against holding cost while acknowledging in-transit units likely due to earlier orders.

Daily Reward (R_t): $184.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/4. Recent demand samples show mean ~236.6 units; current on-hand=418, in-transit=84 (total pipeline=502) covering ~2.1 periods at recent mean. Concluded arrivals show variable lead times (Period1 order lead_time=2, Period2 order lead_time=1). To capture that variability while letting the OR backend compute base stock using observed lead-time average, set L to 'calculate'. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this keeps forecasting anchored to full sample history and lets the OR engine adjust safety stock for the inferred lead time. This balances service (we have moderate pipeline) against holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

Carry-over insight: Observed lead-time variability: arrivals show lead_times = 2 (order Period1) and 1 (order Period2); average observed lead_time=1.5 \u2014 treat lead time as unstable until further concludes.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/11 (Period 5). Recent demand samples show mean ~236.6 (samples [267,298,307,189,122]). On-hand=140, in-transit=403; recent order from Period 4 (319) has not concluded and may be delayed or lost. Observed concluded lead times = [2 (P1->P3), 1 (P2->P3)] \u2192 average 1.5; lead time appears unstable. Set L to 'calculate' so backend uses observed average lead time. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) to keep forecasts anchored to full history while allowing L to capture lead-time instability. This balances service (accounting for longer recent effective lead time) versus holding cost given substantial pipeline inventory.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/18 (Period 6). Recent demand samples mean=236.6 (n=5). On-hand=0, in-transit=602 which matches outstanding orders (Period4=319 + Period5=283) \u2014 no shipments conclusively lost yet. Observed concluded lead_times = 2 (P1), 1 (P2), 2 (P3); avg observed lead_time \u22481.67 and lead time has shown instability. I select L="calculate" so the backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures recent shorter-than-promised LT). For demand parameters I choose default methods so backend computes mu_hat=(1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This balances service (uses realized LT) against holding cost given current heavy in-transit pipeline.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25. Recent demand samples = [267,298,307,189,122]; on-hand=103, in-transit=502. Arrival history shows observed lead_times = {Period3:2,1; Period5:2; Period6:2} => average observed lead time ~1.75 with variability (one 1 among mostly 2s). Some orders have arrived late versus promised but most recent arrivals are 2. To let the OR engine adapt to realized variability I set L by calculating observed lead times (uses empirical average). For demand parameters use defaults so backend applies (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std on full sample\u2014this balances service level (covers L+1 periods of demand) against holding cost given sizable pipeline (502) and moderate on-hand (103). Using calculate/defaults handles unstable but trending L without overfitting to short recent noise.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period start 2019-04-01 (Period 8). On-hand=0, in-transit=705. Historical concluded lead-times from arrivals: Period3 shows P1->2, P2->1; Period5 shows P3->2; Period6 shows P4->2. Average observed lead time = 1.75 and recent observations mostly =2 (one =1) so lead time is unstable but trending to 2. Use L='calculate' to let backend average observed lead times. Demand history samples = [267,298,307,189,122]; no strong recent changepoint in demand magnitude\u2014use default mu_hat & sigma_hat so backend applies (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std, which balances service level vs holding cost given profit/holding ratio. This also guards against potential lost shipments by increasing required pipeline coverage when average L>promised.

Carry-over insight: Observed lead times = {Period3:P1->2,P2->1; Period5:P3->2; Period6:P4->2} \u2192 average observed lead_time=1.75; lead time unstable but recent mode=2 (treat as trending longer lead time).

Daily Reward (R_t): $566.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). Recent concluded arrivals show variable but trending longer lead times (observed lead_times: 2,1,2,2,3 \u2192 mean=2.0). Demand has recovered recently (last 5 concluded demands = 278,250,216,253,283; mean\u2248256). On-hand=0, in-transit=523. I set L to the calculated average of observed lead times to reflect the recent trend to longer/more variable lead time. For demand I use a recent_N estimate (N=5) to capture the current higher-demand regime and reduce weight of older outliers. Sigma_hat also uses recent_N (N=5) to capture current demand volatility. These choices raise the backend base-stock to protect service level given stretched/unstable lead times while keeping variability estimates recent to avoid overstock from old data.

Carry-over insight: Observed lead time has trended longer/unstable; recent observed lead_times = {Period3:P1->2,P2->1; Period5:P3->2; Period6:P4->2; Period8:P5->3}; average observed lead_time=2.0 (use longer lead time until contradicted).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15 (Period 10). Historical concluded lead_times show recent lengthening (arrivals with lead_times = 2,1,2,2,3,3,2; recent concludes shifted to 3). On-hand=246, in-transit=366 \u2014 healthy pipeline but lead-time instability risks undercoverage if L is underestimated. I set L using recent_N to capture the recent upward shift (short recent window to react). mu_hat and sigma_hat use default formulas so backend applies (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std across all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given observed demand variability.

Carry-over insight: Observed average lead_time \u22482.14 across concluded arrivals (values: 2,1,2,2,3,3,2); recent mode shifted to 3 (Periods 8\u20139). Treat lead time as longer/unstable (use longer L) until contradicted.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:

Given unstable but trending longer lead time, let backend compute average observed L from concluded history (calculate). Use default demand aggregation for mu_hat and default volatility for sigma_hat so mu_hat and sigma_hat align with the inferred L and historical demand samples; this increases cover for the longer lead-time while the backend's capped policy limits excessive orders. This addresses missing/late shipments by sizing orders to historical realized lead time until contradicted.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). On-hand=2, in-transit=602. Recent concluded arrivals show increasing and unstable lead times with multiple 3-period arrivals (Periods 8\u20139) and mode shifting to 3; average concluded lead_time \u22482.14. To avoid stockouts given large in-transit but unreliable arrival timing, set lead time to 3 (explicit). Use recent_N for mu_hat (N=5) to reflect the most recent demand regime from available samples. Use default sigma_hat to let backend scale volatility with chosen L. These choices bias orders upward to cover a longer/unstable lead time while keeping volatility estimation standard.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=0, in-transit=749; recent concluded arrivals show lead_times = [2,1,2,2,3,3,3,1] (avg=2.125) with recent mode shifting to 3 but some variability\u2014treat lead time as longer/unstable. Use recent_N for L to weight the most recent variability (N=5 captures last five concluded lead_times = [3,2,3,1,3], avg\u22482.4) so the OR engine plans for extended pipeline. Demand history samples = [267,298,307,189,122]; no clear demand regime shift, so use default mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and default sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples). This raises target base-stock to protect service while defaults keep variance estimation consistent for the capped policy.

Carry-over insight: Lead time trending longer and unstable; recent concluded lead_times average\u22482.125 and recent mode=3 (use longer L until contradicted).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13 (Period 14). Recent concluded arrivals show lead times trending longer and unstable (recent mode shifted to 3 in Periods 8\u201311, overall recent average \u22482.1). On-hand=0, in-transit=783 (large pipeline) but several past orders arrived late (and some short); treat lead time as longer (3) until contradicted. Use L explicit=3 to force the OR backend to plan for the longer delivery window. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples \u2014 this leverages full demand history while the longer L increases safety stock to cover extended lead time and the capped order ensures we don\u2019t over-order against the large in-transit pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Lead time trending longer/unstable; recent concluded lead_times include multiple 3-period arrivals (Periods 8,9,11) and recent average \u22482.1\u20132.2; treat L=3 until contradicted.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). On-hand=150, in-transit=710. Historical concluded lead_times have trended longer and unstable with recent frequent 3-period arrivals (Periods 8,11,12 shows 3s and mode shifted to 3). To protect service given observed longer/unstable lead times, set L explicitly to 3. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this leverages full sample history while the longer L increases coverage for the observed slower arrivals. Current pipeline + on-hand provides substantial cover, but explicit L=3 reduces risk of stockouts if arrivals continue to be delayed.

Carry-over insight: Lead time has trended longer and unstable; recent mode=3 with multiple 3-period arrivals (Periods 8,11,12). Treat L=3 until contradicted.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27 (Period 16). On-hand=0, in-transit=843. Historical concluded lead-times show recent shift toward longer/unstable delivery (multiple 3-period arrivals in Periods 8,11,12 and mode=3); shipments have been delayed/lumpy. To guard against understock while delays persist, set lead time explicitly to 3. Use default mu_hat/sigma_hat so backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over all samples (robust given limited sample history). This increases on-order coverage for the longer/trending lead time and balances service level vs holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). On-hand=0, in-transit=980. Historical concluded lead-times show a recent mode of 3 and persistent longer/unstable delays; to avoid stockouts given large in-transit but uncertain arrivals, treat lead time as lengthened. Set L explicit=3. Use mu_hat recent_N with N=5 to base the (1+L) forecast on all available demand samples [267,298,307,189,122]. Use sigma_hat default to let backend scale variability by sqrt(1+L). These choices bias orders upward to cover the longer observed lead time while relying on full-sample demand stats for stability.

Historical concluded lead_times show recent mode=3 with multiple 3-period arrivals (Periods 8,11,12,15/16 patterns) \u2014 lead time trending longer and unstable.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-15 (Period 23). Recent concluded arrivals show multiple 3-period lead times (Periods 8,11,12,19 and later concludes) and the running carry-over notes recommend treating lead time as 3 until contradicted. On-hand=0, in-transit=1016 \u2014 substantial pipeline exists but lead time instability/lift to 3 risks delayed arrivals. I therefore set L explicitly to 3 to hedge against longer deliveries. For demand, I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, keeping forecasts grounded in full historical demand while the longer L raises safety stock automatically.

Carry-over insight: Lead time trending longer and unstable; recent concluded lead_times include multiple 3-period arrivals (Periods 8,11,12,19 and later), treat L=3 until contradicted.

LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22). SKU 464297007 on-hand=0, in-transit=862. Historical concluded arrivals show a persistent shift to longer/unstable lead times with multiple 3-period arrivals in recent history (Periods 8,11,12,19 and later), so treat L as 3 until contradicted. Using L=3 keeps the (1+L) review window consistent with observed delays and ensures pipeline coverage. Demand history samples=[267,298,307,189,122] used with default aggregation for mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR backend computes base-stock and cap accounting for longer lead time while balancing profit vs holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Lead time has trended longer and unstable; recent concluded lead_times include multiple 3-period arrivals (Periods 8,11,12,19 and later). Treat L=3 until contradicted.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Recent concluded arrivals show a clear shift toward longer, unstable lead times with multiple 3-period arrivals; on-hand=0, in-transit=1085 (large pipeline). To protect against understock if actual L=3 persists, set L explicitly to 3. Use mu_hat default and sigma_hat default so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting the backend scale safety stock given the longer L while capping orders against the cap. This balances service (avoid stockouts given longer lead time) versus holding cost given already-large in-transit pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Lead time has trended longer and unstable; recent concluded lead_times include multiple 3-period arrivals (Periods 8,11,12,19 and later). Treat L=3 until contradicted.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/5 (Period 26). On-hand=0, in-transit=1085. Historical concludes show lead times have trended longer and unstable with multiple 3-period arrivals (Periods 8,11,12,19 and subsequent concludes). Given repeated 3-period mode and risk of missing/late shipments, set L=3 to provision for longer arrival. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full demand history \u2014 this leverages all samples while the longer lead time raises required pipeline coverage, balancing service level vs holding cost with current high in-transit volume.

Recent concluded arrivals show multiple 3-period lead_times (Periods 8,11,12,19,23,26) and the carry-over history indicates a stable shift/trend to L=3.

Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples \u2014 this balances higher required pipeline for longer lead time while letting the backend compute safety stock via its profit/holding tradeoff.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=0, in-transit=1067. Recent concluded arrivals include multiple 3-period lead times (Periods 8, 11, 19, 23, 26 and later), signaling a longer/unstable lead time. I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect the recent mode and avoid under-ordering given long arrivals; mu_hat and sigma_hat left as default so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all demand samples, letting the base-stock formula balance service vs holding cost while accounting for the longer lead time and large in-transit pipeline.

LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=1067. History of concluded arrivals shows a sustained shift toward 3-period lead times (many concluded lead_time=3 across recent periods), shipments unstable but trending longer; pipeline is large but arrival timing uncertain. I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect the recent mode=3 and avoid under-ordering given long/variable lead times. I leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) respectively, letting the engine compute service-level tradeoffs given the longer L and current demand data.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). Recent demand mean ~236.6 (historical samples). On-hand=0, in-transit=1046 \u2014 pipeline currently exceeds the (1+L)-period demand forecast. Concluded arrivals repeatedly show multi-period delays with mode=3 (many 3-period lead-times in history, including Period30 arrival from Period27), so treat lead time as longer/unstable and use L=3. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this leverages the full sample set while the explicit L accounts for observed longer lead times and prevents under-ordering despite past volatility. No evidence of lost shipments beyond delayed arrivals.

Multiple concluded arrivals across recent periods show frequent 3-period lead_times (Periods 8,11,12,19,23,26,27,30 etc.); recent mode = 3 and lead time has trended longer/unstable. On-hand=0, in-transit=1046 (large pipeline). To guard against longer/unreliable supply we set L explicitly to 3. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this leverages full historical demand while the larger L inflates the review+lead demand and uncertainty, increasing target base-stock to protect service level despite potential delayed arrivals. Given large in-transit, this also avoids over-ordering by letting OR engine cap orders.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). On-hand=0, in-transit=1046 \u2014 large pipeline but many late/unstable concludes historically. Concluded lead_times have trended longer with many 3-period arrivals across recent periods (Periods 8,11,12,19,23,26 and later). To avoid stockouts during prolonged/uncertain lead-time regime, set L explicitly to 3 (reflecting recent mode and trend). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples; this leverages full demand history while the explicit L addresses the lead-time drift and helps the OR engine size orders to cover the longer/noisy pipeline.

Demand history (samples) shows moderate mean; large pipeline means we must use a longer lead time to ensure orders cover review+lead demand.

Let mu_hat and sigma_hat use default formulas ((1+L)\xd7mean, sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR backend scales demand forecast and volatility to the longer lead+review horizon and balances service vs holding cost automatically.

LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=0, in-transit=1067. Historical concluded arrivals show a persistent mode of 3-period lead times across recent concludes (multiple orders with lead_time=3). Given repeated 3-period arrivals and risk of missing shipments, set L explicitly to 3 to capture the longer, unstable lead-time regime. Use default demand/volatility aggregation so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full samples; this balances service (higher base_stock for longer L) versus holding cost while leveraging full-sample statistics.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). On-hand=0, in-transit=1058. Historical concluded arrivals show lead times trending longer/unstable with recent mode=3; therefore treat current lead time as 3 to protect against longer arrivals. In-transit volume is large but may arrive late; use L=3 (explicit). Use mu_hat default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples (conservative demand forecast over review+lead). Use sigma_hat default so backend computes sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples, preserving backend's uncertainty estimate. This balances higher safety stock for delayed arrivals against holding cost given high in-transit inventory.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/4 (Period 39). On-hand=0, in-transit=1058. Historical concluded arrivals show a persistent shift toward 3-period lead times (multiple concluded arrivals with lead_time=3 across recent periods). Large in-transit stock suggests prior orders were sent under longer/unstable lead times; to avoid stockouts from further unseen delays, set L=3 (explicit). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the demand samples, preserving statistical grounding while accounting for longer lead time. This increases pipeline cover (L+1) periods to balance service level vs holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

Carry-over insight: Lead time has trended longer and unstable; recent concluded arrivals show a persistent mode=3 (multiple 3-period lead times in recent concludes). Treat L=3 until contradicted.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). Demand history shows intermittent spikes and many stockouts; current on-hand=0, in-transit=1058. Concluded arrivals over many periods show a persistent mode=3 and recent cluster of 3-period lead_times (Periods noted in history), so treat lead time as longer/unstable and set L=3 explicitly. With L=3 I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full history\u2014this leverages all demand data while letting the backend calculate safety stock given profit/holding tradeoff. The large in-transit volume (1058) likely covers multiple review+lead periods; using default demand estimates avoids overfitting short-term noise while the explicit L protects against underestimated arrival delays.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). On-hand=0, in-transit=1058. Historical concluded arrivals show a persistent shift to longer/unstable lead times with multiple 3-period arrivals (Periods 8,11,12,19,23,26 and later). To avoid stockouts given large in-transit but uncertain arrival timing, set L explicitly to 3 (follow recent modal lead time). Use default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and default volatility so the OR backend computes base_stock and cap using the longer L while leveraging historical demand samples. This choice biases orders upward to cover the longer/unstable lead time until contradicted by future conclude messages.

Carry-over insight: Lead time has trended longer and unstable; recent concluded lead_times show a persistent mode=3 (multiple 3-period arrivals in concluded history: Periods 8,11,12,19,23,26 and later). Treat L=3 until contradicted.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=0, in-transit=1058. Historical concluded lead-times show persistent shift/trend to 3-period arrivals (multiple concluded 3s across recent periods). To avoid stockouts given unstable/longer lead times, set L explicitly to 3 so backend inflates pipeline cover; use default demand pooling for mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend applies (1+L) scaling to the sample statistics and computes safety stock per profit/holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Lead time has trended longer and stabilized around mode=3 across recent concluded arrivals; treat L=3 until contradicted (evidence: multiple concluded 3-period lead times in recent history).

Historical concluded arrivals show lead-time has trended longer and stabilized at mode=3 across many recent concludes (Periods 8,11,12,19,23,26 and later through 42). Given persistent 3-period arrivals, set L explicitly to 3. With a large in-transit pipeline (1058 units) we avoid aggressive new ordering; use default demand estimators so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the sample data and balances service vs holding cost under the longer lead time.
