Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Demand history shows samples [267,298,307,189,122] (mean ~236). No concluded arrivals or lead-time evidence; pipeline=0 and on-hand=0. Promised lead time (2) is used. Use default demand estimators so backend sets base-stock = (1+L)*mean and volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances service level given steady historical demand and avoids overreacting to limited samples.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 (2019-02-18). Recent demand history (samples=[267,298,307,189,122], mean\u2248236.6) shows no clear upward/downward regime. On-hand=0, in-transit=367 from an order placed in Period 1 that has not concluded arrival yet. No concluded arrivals exist to change promised lead time (2); therefore use default lead time and default demand statistics ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR engine produces a base-stock reflecting the promised L=2 and full-sample demand estimates while awaiting arrival confirmation. This choice balances service level (using full-sample mean) against holding cost given moderate holding ($1) vs profit ($2). Monitor for arrival confirmation or prolonged non-conclusion (possible lost shipment) to revise L explicitly if needed.

Carry-over insight: Possible overdue/lost shipment: ordered=367 on Period 1, arrived=0 in Period 1 conclude; monitor for subsequent conclude messages to confirm arrival or loss.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. On-hand=0, in-transit=719. Two recent concludes show zero arrivals for recent orders but promised lead time=2 implies arrivals may still be due; do not treat as lost yet. Use default lead time to align with contract (L=2). Demand history (samples [267,298,307,189,122]) has no clear regime shift, so use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This keeps the base-stock tied to long-run demand while avoiding overreaction to potentially delayed shipments given high in-transit inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $184.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent concluded arrivals show orders from Period1 had lead_time=2 and Period2 had lead_time=1 (no lost shipments confirmed). On-hand=418, in-transit=84, recent demand samples=[267,298,307,189,122] with realized demands high in Periods 2-3. Choose L="calculate" to let backend use observed lead times (captures variability 1\u20132). Use mu_hat="default" and sigma_hat="default" so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample set, balancing service level against holding cost given profit=2 and holding=1.

Carry-over insight: Observed lead times variable: Period1\u21922, Period2\u21921 (avg=1.5); no evidence of lost shipments after Period3 conclude.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 Period 5. On-hand=140, in-transit=403. Historical demands [267,298,307,189,122] with recent sales 301,278. Concluded arrivals show variable lead times (observed 2 and 1 \u2192 avg 1.5) and no confirmed lost shipments after Period 3. To reflect recent lead-time variability use recent_N for L (N=2). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend applies (1+L) scaling to full-sample mean/std, balancing service level (covers review+lead demand) against holding cost given modest on-hand + substantial in-transit.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/18 (Period 6). On-hand=0, in-transit=602. Historical concluded lead times: Period3 shows PL1->2, PL2->1; Period5 shows PL3->2 -> observed lead times = [2,1,2], recent average ~1.67. Demand history samples = [267,298,307,189,122]; recent demand shows elevated mid-sample but overall mean uses all 5. I set L to recent_N (N=3) to reflect the observed ~1.67 periods instead of blindly using promised 2. For mu_hat I use recent_N with N=5 to base the forecast on all available demand samples (scaled by 1+L by backend). Sigma_hat left as default to let backend compute volatility from full sample set. These choices balance service (capture slightly shorter observed lead time) while keeping demand forecast grounded in full sample to avoid overreacting to short spikes; helps OR backend produce orders that cover (1+L) periods of demand given in-transit stock and possible past variability.

Carry-over insight: Observed lead-time regime: concluded lead times = [2,1,2] (Periods 3 & 5); recent average ~1.67 periods suggesting variability around promised L=2. Previous possible lost shipment (Period1 ordered 367) resolved by arrival in Period3; no sustained lost-shipment signal.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25): on-hand=103, in-transit=555. Recent concluded lead times = [2,1,2] (Periods 3,4,5/6 arrivals) \u2192 recent average ~1.67, showing variability vs promised L=2 but no sustained lost-shipment signal (Period1 order resolved). Demand recent sequence (last 5 observed periods) = [373,301,278,250,216], mean elevated vs earlier baseline; use recent demand window to capture current regime. Decisions: set L using recent_N (N=3) to reflect observed lead-time variability; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to focus the forecast and volatility on the most recent demand regime. This balances service (higher mu_hat for elevated recent demand) while sigma_hat from recent data controls safety stock; using recent lead-time average reduces mismatch from promised L=2 when computing pipeline coverage.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=792. Historical concluded lead times = [2,1,2,2] (from Periods 3,3,5,6); recent variability around promised L=2. Notably, the order placed in Period 5 (283 units) has not arrived by Period 7 conclude (overdue), signaling possible delay/loss risk. I use recent_N for L (N=3) to weight the most recent lead-time behavior (captures recent 1.67\u20131.75 avg and variability). For demand forecast and uncertainty I use default population estimates so the OR backend computes mu_hat and sigma_hat using all samples scaled by (1+L). This balances service level against holding cost given high in-transit inventory but current on-hand=0 and the overdue arrival risk.

Carry-over insight: New overdue shipment risk: order placed in Period 5 (283 units) had arrived=0 in Period 7 conclude, treat as potentially delayed/lost until confirmed by a future conclude.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=523. Historical concluded lead times = [2,1,2,2,3] (avg=2.0) with occasional delay (a single 3-period). Recent overdue shipments have been resolved (no sustained lost-shipment signal). I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the observed-average lead time (captures occasional delays). Demand samples = [267,298,307,189,122]; no clear recent regime shift, so use default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to let the OR engine compute base stock while keeping safety stock responsive to observed variability. This balances service (profit > holding cost) while avoiding overreaction to a single delayed arrival.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15): on-hand=333, in-transit=303. Recent concluded lead times show variability and a mean slightly above promised 2 (observed sequence ~[2,1,2,2,3,3,2], avg\u22482.14) so use calculated L to let backend learn actual lead time. Demand has shifted recently (volatile last periods) so use a recent_N demand forecast to focus on latest regime (reduces risk of underordering vs using long-run mean). Keep sigma_hat default to let backend scale uncertainty with chosen L. These choices balance service (higher L and recent demand raise base_stock) against holding cost given current healthy on-hand + in-transit.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22 (Period 11). Observed concluded lead times show variability and a recent uptick: last 5 concluded lead times = [2,2,3,3,2] (avg 2.4), so I use recent_N for L to capture current regime. On-hand=164, in-transit=425; no persistent lost-shipment signal but lead times are above promised=2 recently, so increasing L avoids under-ordering. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend scales demand mean/variance by chosen L; this balances service (higher L -> larger base_stock) versus holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

Carry-over insight: Recent lead-time regime increased: last 5 concluded lead times avg=2.4 (observed [2,2,3,3,2] from recent concludes); treat lead time as elevated versus promised=2.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 start: on-hand=2, in-transit=602. Recent concluded lead times show increased variability and an upward shift (recent concludes: [2,2,3,3,2] average ~2.4) and some multi-period delays (several 3-period leads). To protect service level given elevated/variable lead time and pending large pipeline, I set L using a recent average of the last 5 observed lead times. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat at defaults so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all historical demand samples, letting the backend incorporate the chosen L into demand-across-review+lead calculations. This approach addresses delayed arrivals by inflating the forecast horizon while relying on full-sample demand stats to avoid overreacting to short-term demand noise.

Carry-over insight: Recent sustained increase in lead time: last 5 concluded lead times = [2,2,3,3,2], average \u22482.4 \u2014 treat lead time as elevated vs promised=2 until contradicted by future concludes.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). On-hand=0, in-transit=574. Historical concluded lead times = [2,1,2,2,3,3,2,3,1] (9 observations) => average \u22482.11, showing modest elevation/variability vs promised L=2. Demand samples = [267,298,307,189,122], mean=236.6. Use calculated average lead time to reflect recent variability and avoid under-ordering given in-transit volume and recent delays. Set L by calculating average observed lead time; use default demand/std procedures so OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std, balancing service level (higher L raises base-stock) against holding cost when in-transit already large.

Carry-over insight: Observed lead times (9 concluded): [2,1,2,2,3,3,2,3,1], average \u22482.11 \u2014 modestly elevated/variable vs promised L=2; monitor future concludes for confirmation.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). On-hand=12, in-transit=620. Recent concluded lead times show elevated/variable L (~2.1\u20132.4) so use a recent-window estimate to capture current regime. Demand has shifted recently (high variance, recent demands: 169,176,323,122,151) so use recent_N for demand mean and volatility (N=5) to reflect the last regime and limit overstating demand from older samples. These choices bias orders toward covering the current elevated lead time and recent demand level to reduce stockouts while controlling holding cost.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). Recent concluded lead times show variability with average slightly >2 (recent sequence avg \u22482.1). On-hand=0, in-transit=620 \u2014 ample pipeline stock but arrivals historically variable and some late arrivals observed. Use calculated L (average of observed lead times) to let backend adapt to modestly elevated/variable lead-time regime. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so demand estimate uses full sample mean/std scaled by (1+L) chosen above; this yields conservative safety stock without overfitting short-term noise given plentiful in-transit inventory.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). On-hand=0, in-transit=743 \u2014 large pipeline currently covers multiple periods. Historical concluded lead times show variability with recent sample of 9 concluded lead times averaging \u22482.11 (values: [2,1,2,2,3,3,2,3,1]); this is modestly elevated/variable relative to promised L=2. I set L to recent_N (N=9) to reflect recent lead-time regime. Demand history is limited; keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so backend uses all samples scaled by (1+L) to compute base_stock and variability. This balances service (accounting for slightly elevated lead time) while relying on large in-transit to avoid over-ordering.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10 (Period 18). On-hand=0, in-transit=743. Historical concluded lead times show variability and a mild elevation vs promised L=2 but no persistent lost-shipment signal; use inferred average lead time from observed concludes so OR backend uses realized regime. Demand history samples = [267,298,307,189,122]; I select L by calculating the average of all observed concluded lead times to capture variability. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) I use defaults so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, which balances service level uplift under elevated/variable lead time against holding cost given profit=2 and holding=1.

Carry-over insight: Recent concluded lead times are variable and mildly elevated vs promised L=2 (multiple concludes show 2\u20133 period realizations); monitor further concludes for confirmation.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). On-hand=0, in-transit=743 covers multiple periods given demand history. Concluded lead times in recent history are variable and mildly elevated vs promised L=2 (recent 5-conclude average \u22482.4), so use a recent average for L. Demand history shows no strong regime shift beyond recent variability; use recent_N for mu_hat to reflect latest demand level over the review+lead window. Use default volatility to let OR backend scale with chosen L. This balances higher lead-time risk (raise target inventory) while relying on large in-transit stock to avoid over-ordering.

Carry-over insight: Recent lead time elevated vs promised=2: last 5 concluded lead times average \u22482.4 (evidence from recent concludes); treat as temporarily higher lead-time until future concludes contradict.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24 (Period 20). On-hand=0, in-transit=620. Concluded lead times in recent periods are variable and mildly elevated vs promised L=2 (recent concluded lead times average \u22482.2). Demand has increased recently: last 5 period demands = [171,200,154,281,556], mean \u2248272 (higher than historical samples). There are past delayed arrivals but no persistent lost-shipment signal; use a short recent average for L to reflect elevated/variable lead time, and use recent-demand estimates for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the upward demand shift and higher volatility. Methods chosen: L as recent_N (N=5) to target the most recent lead-time regime; mu_hat recent_N (N=5) to size (1+L)-period demand to the recent higher mean; sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These settings raise base stock to protect service level under longer/variable lead times and higher demand while allowing the OR cap to limit extreme orders.

Carry-over insight: Recent demand regime increased: last 5 demands mean \u2248272 vs historical mean \u2248237; Recent lead time mildly elevated: last 5 concluded lead times avg \u22482.2 \u2014 treat as temporary elevation until future concludes confirm.

Historical demands [267,298,307,189,122] with recent 5-period demand mean elevated (~272 per prior insight) and demand volatility high (recent large spikes e.g. 556). Concluded lead times recently elevated/variable (last 5 concludes avg \u22482.4). To protect service given elevated lead time and higher recent demand, I set L to recent_N (N=5) to capture the elevated regime; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N (N=5) to bias forecast and volatility toward most recent demand pattern. This increases target base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of recent demand and raises safety stock via higher sigma_hat, balancing lost-sales cost (profit $2) vs holding cost $1.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-15 Period 23. History shows variable but mildly elevated lead times recently (recent 5 concluded lead times avg \u22482.4) and a higher recent demand regime (last 5 demands mean \u2248272 vs overall mean \u2248237). On-hand=0, in-transit=622 (covering pipeline). To reflect elevated lead time and recent higher demand I set L by recent average and base-stock demand parameters from recent demand samples; this raises target pipeline to reduce stockouts given delayed arrivals while sigma uses recent volatility to size safety stock. Recent potential past delayed shipments were resolved; no persistent lost-shipment signal, but higher L hedges against further delays.

Carry-over insight: Recent lead time elevated: last 5 concluded lead times average \u22482.4 (treat as temporarily higher vs promised=2); Recent demand regime increased: last 5 demands mean \u2248272 (above historical mean \u2248237).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22). On-hand=0, in-transit=1085 \u2014 strong pipeline but concluded lead times have been variable and modestly elevated (recent concluded values cluster 1\u20133, recent averages reported ~2.1\u20132.4). Use calculate for L so the backend averages observed lead times from concluded messages (captures actual variability vs promised=2). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so demand sizing uses all historical samples scaled by (1+L) from backend; this is conservative given large in-transit stock and avoids overfitting short-term noise while letting the OR engine cap orders appropriately. Continue to monitor overdue arrivals in subsequent concludes.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29 (Period 25). On-hand=0, in-transit=1085. Recent concludes show lead times variable and mildly elevated vs promised L=2 (recent 5 concluded lead times \u22482.4); demand has been higher in recent periods (recent 5-period mean \u2248272 > historical mean \u2248237). To protect service against the elevated/variable lead time while reflecting higher recent demand, set L to recent_N over last 5 concluded lead times. Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=5) so the OR backend builds base stock and caps from the most recent demand regime. This approach increases replenishment cover for the longer/more variable lead time and raises forecasted demand to match the recent upward regime, balancing lost-sales risk vs holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=0, in-transit=1085. Recent concludes show mildly elevated/variable lead times and higher recent demand: last 5 concluded lead times average \u22482.4 and last 5 demands mean \u2248272 (above long-run mean \u2248237). With substantial in-transit stock (1085) we still want the OR backend to account for the recent regime: set L via recent lead-time sample and set demand estimates from recent demand samples so base-stock and cap reflect the higher demand and slightly longer lead time, avoiding stockouts while limiting extra holding given holding cost=$1/unit. Methods chosen: recent 5-period windows for L, mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent upward shift while keeping responsiveness to future changes.

Carry-over insight: Recent demand regime increased: last 5 demands mean \u2248272 (higher than historical mean \u2248237); Recent lead time mildly elevated/variable: last 5 concluded lead times average \u22482.4 (vs promised=2).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). Recent concludes show lead times elevated/variable vs promised (last 5 concluded lead times avg \u22482.4) and demand has stepped up (last 5 demands mean \u2248272 > historical \u2248237). On-hand=126 + in-transit=620 provides substantial pipeline but variability in lead time argues using recent lead-time estimate. I set L via recent_N to reflect the last 5 concluded lead times, and set mu_hat and sigma_hat via recent_N (N=5) to focus the forecast and volatility on the new, higher-demand regime. This biases base-stock up for higher service during prolonged/variable lead times while keeping variability estimate tied to recent observations.

Carry-over insight: Recent demand regime increased: last 5 demands mean \u2248272 (above historical mean \u2248237); Recent lead time elevated/variable: last 5 concluded lead times average \u22482.4 (treat as temporarily higher vs promised=2).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19 (Period 28). On-hand=0, in-transit=795. Recent demand regime is elevated: last 5 demands mean \u2248272 vs historical mean \u2248237. Recent concluded lead times are mildly elevated/variable (recent avg \u22482.4). There are no unresolved lost-shipments in the concludes; delays appear systemic. To capture recent higher demand while acknowledging variable lead time, set L using recent lead-time evidence (recent_N N=5), set mu_hat from recent demand (recent_N N=5) to size the (1+L) review+lead forecast to current regime, and keep sigma_hat as default to let backend scale volatility across the (1+L) horizon. This increases target base-stock to maintain service with elevated demand and variable lead time while relying on default volatility to avoid overfitting.

Carry-over insight: Recent demand regime increased: last 5 demands mean \u2248272 (sustained vs historical mean \u2248237); Recent lead time mildly elevated/variable: last 5 concluded lead times average \u22482.4 (treat as temporarily higher vs promised=2).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/26 (Period 29). On-hand=0, in-transit=836. Recent concludes show lead times slightly elevated/variable vs promised=2 (recent concludes avg ~2.4) and demand has shifted up (recent 5-demand mean \u2248272 vs historical \u2248237). To balance service level vs holding cost I set L to a recent-average to capture elevated lead-time regime, use recent-demand mean for mu_hat to reflect the higher demand regime, and keep sigma_hat default (use full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L)) to avoid overfitting volatility from few samples.

Carry-over insight: Recent demand regime increased: last 5 demands mean \u2248272 (sustained vs historical mean \u2248237); Recent lead time elevated/variable: last 5 concluded lead times average \u22482.4 (treat as temporarily higher vs promised=2).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Recent demand (last 5 periods: Periods 25-29) shows moderate volume with mean used for forecasting. I select recent_N for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat with N=5 so the OR backend uses the most recent demand/lead-time regime; this balances service (captures recent variability) against holding cost given large in-transit stock.

Historical demand samples = [267,298,307,189,122] with mean\u2248236.6; demand history shows a recent higher regime but limited samples. Observed concluded lead times have been variable (1\u20133 periods). To capture actual lead-time variability I set L by 'calculate' (backend will average observed lead times). I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as 'default' so the backend uses (1+L)\xd7historical mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std, letting the OR engine adjust base-stock given the inferred L. This balances service (by recognizing elevated/variable lead time) against holding cost given already-large pipeline inventory.

Recent concluded lead times have been mildly elevated/variable (recent 5 avg \u22482.4) and recent demand regime is higher (last 5 demands mean \u2248272 vs historical \u2248237). To reflect elevated lead time risk use recent_N for L (N=5). To capture the recent demand uptick use recent_N for mu_hat (N=5). Use recent_N for sigma_hat (N=5) to reflect recent volatility.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/23 (Period 33). On-hand=0, in-transit=661. Recent concluded lead times have been mildly elevated/variable (~2\u20133); to be conservative I set L explicitly above promised=2 to reflect this (use 2.4). Demand has softened in the most recent 5 periods (Period28\u201332 demands: 100,124,101,77,194; recent mean\u2248119) so I set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to focus the forecast on the current lower regime. sigma_hat left as default to let backend compute variability across all samples scaled by sqrt(1+L). These choices aim to keep pipeline cover adequate for the longer effective lead time while avoiding excessive holding by using a recent low-demand mean.

Historical concluded lead times show variability and a recent elevation (recent 5-conclude average \u22482.4), and demand appears elevated vs long-run mean. To reflect the recent lead-time regime and recent higher demand, I use recent_N=5 for lead time estimation and recent demand statistics for mu and sigma so the OR engine builds a larger base-stock and captures recent volatility. This helps cover the (L+1) periods of demand given delayed/variable arrivals while balancing holding cost via the engine's cap.

Period 35 (2019-10-07). On-hand=0, in-transit=865. Historical concludes show variable/occasionally elevated lead times (multiple 2\u20133 period realizations; overall average modestly above promised=2) and sporadic demand spikes (recent high demands). To let the backend incorporate the observed lead-time variability directly, set L to 'calculate' (average of concluded lead times). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from the demand samples, keeping the policy consistent with the inferred L while relying on the engine's capped policy to limit order size. This balances service (higher L\u2192larger review+lead forecast) against holding cost and caps exposure to delays. Monitor future concludes for lost shipments or further lead-time shifts.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). Demand history shows variable but generally elevated recent demand vs early history; concluded lead times are noisy around 2 (some 1\u20133). On-hand=122, in-transit=620 provides substantial pipeline cover. I choose to let the backend compute an L estimate from observed concludes to capture variable lead-time behavior (method=calculate) and use default demand/volatility aggregation so estimates incorporate full sample history ((1+L)\xd7mean, sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This is conservative: preserves service level given elevated/variable lead times while avoiding overreacting to short-term spikes since on-hand+pipeline is already large.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). Current on-hand=22, in-transit=691. Recent concluded lead times are variable and mildly elevated vs promised L=2; recent demand has spiked and become more volatile (last 5 demands average high). To capture the recent regime I use recent_N (N=5) for lead time, demand forecast (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) so the OR backend sizes a base-stock that reflects elevated mean demand and higher dispersion while accounting for the variable lead time and large pipeline.

Recent concluded lead times have been variable and mildly elevated vs promised L=2; recent demand (last 5) is higher than long-run mean. Set L to recent_N (N=5) to capture elevated/variable lead-time regime. Set mu_hat to recent_N (N=5) to reflect the recent higher demand regime over the review+lead horizon. Use default sigma_hat to let backend scale volatility with chosen L while avoiding overfitting given noisy lead-time/demand variability. This balances service (avoid stockouts given long pipeline and elevated lead times) against holding cost by using recent demand signal for target stock and default volatility for cap computation.

Historical concluded lead times show variability and mild elevation vs promised=2; use computed average lead time to reflect observed variability. Demand has shown a recent higher regime \u2014 use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture current demand levels; use default sigma_hat to let backend scale variability with chosen L.

Recent concluded lead times mildly elevated/variable: last 5 concluded lead times avg \u22482.4. To reflect higher short-term demand and elevated lead time, set L using recent 5 concludes and set mu_hat/sigma_hat using recent 5 demand samples (captures current regime and variability). This keeps pipeline cover (1+L) periods tuned to recent higher demand while letting the OR backend compute service-level buffer.

Recent concluded lead times have been mildly elevated/variable vs promised=2 (recent 5-obs avg \u22482.4) and recent demand regime is higher (last 5 mean \u2248272 > historical mean \u2248237). To avoid stockouts given large pipeline but elevated lead-time variability, set L to recent_N (average of last 5 observed lead times) so the OR backend inflates safety coverage for longer arrivals. Use recent_N for mu_hat (last 5 demands) to capture the higher recent demand regime over the (1+L) review+lead horizon. Keep sigma_hat as default to let backend scale volatility using full sample variance. These choices trade higher replenishment targets to protect service during elevated demand/lead-time uncertainty while relying on existing large in-transit stock to limit excess ordering.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). On-hand=0, in-transit=1026 \u2014 substantial pipeline but arrivals may be delayed per history. Concluded lead times have been variable and modestly elevated vs promised L=2 (recent concludes average \u22482.4), so set L by 'calculate' to let backend use observed lead-time history. Recent demand is above long-run historical mean; use recent_N for mu_hat with N=5 (captures most recent demand regime). Use default sigma_hat to reflect full-sample volatility scaled by (1+L). These choices raise target base-stock for elevated lead time and higher recent demand while keeping dispersion estimate conservative.

Carry-over insight: Recent lead time elevated vs promised=2: last concluded lead times average \u22482.4 (evidence from multiple recent concludes); Recent demand regime increased: last 5 demands (Periods 37-41) mean \u2248243, above earlier long-run mean \u2248237.

Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=1026. Recent concludes show variable but modestly elevated lead times vs promised L=2 and recent demand has been slightly above long-run mean. Use 'calculate' for L so backend averages all observed concluded lead times (captures persistent mild elevation). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to align the forecast and volatility with the latest demand regime (last 5 periods) so orders respond to the recent higher demand while limiting excess stock given holding cost. This balances service level (accounting for slightly longer lead times) against holding costs and addresses prior delayed arrivals by letting the backend see the empirical lead-time average.

Recent concluded lead times have been elevated/variable vs promised L=2 (recent 5-conclude average \u22482.4), so use a recent-average L to capture slower arrivals.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:

Pipeline large (in-transit=1106) but on-hand=0; expect in-transit to cover multiple periods once arrivals conclude. Observed concluded lead times recently elevated/variable (many 2\u20133 period realizations). To reflect short-term elevated demand and recent lead-time variability, set L to recent_N (use last 5 concluded lead times), set mu_hat to recent_N over last 5 demand samples to capture current regime, and set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias base-stock upward to avoid stockouts during the higher-demand regime while accounting for elevated lead time variability; large existing in-transit reduces aggressive extra ordering risk.

Historical/concluded lead times show mild elevation/variability vs promised L=2 (recent concludes avg ~2.1\u20132.4). Recent demand regime higher than long-run (last 5 avg \u2248272). To reflect observed lead-time behavior, set L by calculating the average of concluded lead times. To capture the recent higher demand regime and its volatility while respecting substantial in-transit stock, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 demand samples (recent_N N=5) so the OR engine sizes orders to the current elevated demand and observed variability without overreacting to older data.
