Period 47 (2019/12/30) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Period 47 decision uses observed state: on-hand=0, in-transit=960. Recent demand has been ~360 units/period (Periods 44\u201346: 380,360,358) and carry-over insight records a sustained regime shift to ~356 since Period 19. Promised L=2 so decision must cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand (current period demand occurs after ordering). Target coverage = 3 * 360 \u2248 1080 units. Shortfall = 1080 - (on-hand + in-transit) = 1080 - 960 = 120 units. Supplier lead times have varied (1\u20133), and some past orders were delayed or lost, so topping up conservatively minimizes stockout risk while avoiding excess holding cost. OR recommended 0 because it used promised L and historical baseline; I increase to 120 to cover the 3-period demand requirement given current pipeline shortfall and lead-time uncertainty.",
