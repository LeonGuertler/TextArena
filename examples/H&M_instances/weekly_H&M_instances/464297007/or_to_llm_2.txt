Situation: on-hand=0, in-transit=0, so pipeline provides no cover. Because lead time is long (promised 4) and there are no arrivals/concludes yet, we must ensure coverage for the current period plus the next 4 periods (L+1). Ordering only OR's capped 367 would leave ~816 units uncovered (\u22483.5 periods of expected demand), risking large lost sales and profit loss. Holding cost is non-trivial ($1/unit/period) but losing sales at $2 profit/unit is costlier given current zero inventory and long lead time. I therefore target expected demand over the lead+review horizon (\u03bc\u0302=1183) rather than OR's capped value \u2014 this covers mean demand for 5 periods while avoiding the extra safety stock that pushes to 1259 and would increase holding costs without strong evidence of higher variance or upcoming demand surge.
