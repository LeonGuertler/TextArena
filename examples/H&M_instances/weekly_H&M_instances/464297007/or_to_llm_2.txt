Inventory & demand analysis: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent demand (P40\u2013P46) = [387,348,311,266,380,360,358], recent mean \u2248 344 units \u2014 demand clearly in the mid-300s. OR base-stock cap = 349 units; OR used promised L=0 and historical demand to compute this. Strategy: follow OR recommendation of 349 units because it matches recent observed demand and accounts for safety stock (profit/holding implies high service target). This minimizes lost sales given zero pipeline and avoids excessive overstock given holding cost = $1/unit. Order 349 to arrive same period and satisfy expected demand.",
