Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no concluded arrivals to infer lead-time drift. Historical demands [267,298,307,189,122] give mean ~236.6 and moderate variance. Promised lead time (2) remains best prior; use default aggregation so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This balances service level (use 3-period demand coverage) against holding cost given limited inventory and no evidence of lost shipments.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 (2019-02-18). On-hand=0, in-transit=367 (order placed Period 1) and Period 1 conclude shows arrived=0 \u2014 this single non-arrival is expected under promised lead time=2 and is insufficient to infer loss or a shorter/longer actual lead time. Historical demand samples = [267,298,307,189,122] (mean=236.6). To avoid overfitting to a single late arrival signal, use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std; this balances service level given a sizable in-transit quantity while keeping holding exposure moderate.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/2/25 (Period 3). On-hand=0, in-transit=719 (orders from P1=367 and P2=352). Promised lead time=2 and no concluded arrivals yet \u2014 consistent with expected arrival timing (orders placed in P1/P2 will arrive during P3/P4 and only be visible in subsequent conclude messages). Historical demand samples = [267,298,307,189,122]. No clear changepoint or evidence of lost shipments yet. Use default lead time (promised) and default demand estimates so the OR backend applies its base-stock calculation using full-sample mean/variance across the (1+L) review+lead horizon; this balances service level given modest profit/holding ratio while avoiding overreacting to currently in-transit inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $184.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent demands: [267,298,307,189,122] (mean=236.6). On-hand=418, in-transit=84. Conclude messages show arrivals: Period3 conclude -> orders placed Period1 arrived with lead_time=2, Period2 arrived with lead_time=1. This indicates mixed actual lead times vs promised=2 and one faster arrival; no evidence of lost shipments yet. I choose L='calculate' to let backend use observed lead times (captures 2 and 1). For demand parameters I use 'default' (no clear regime shift in demand series); backend will compute mu_hat=(1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This balances service level (accounting for observed lead-time variability) against holding cost given on-hand + small in-transit pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Observed lead times so far: 2 (order on Period1) and 1 (order on Period2) => mixed regime; average observed lead time ~1.5. No confirmed lost shipments.

Daily Reward (R_t): $416.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). On-hand=140, in-transit=403. Recent concluded lead times = 2 (order P1) and 1 (order P2) => mixed short regime, avg ~1.5; no confirmed lost shipments. To reflect the observed shorter lead times I set L using recent_N over the last 2 observed lead times. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR engine uses (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples). This leans inventory targets lower than promised L=2 (reducing extra ordering given large pipeline) while letting the backend compute safety stock from full demand history.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). On-hand=0, in-transit=602, recent demands=[267,298,307,189,122]. Observed lead times from concluded messages: 2 (P1), 1 (P2), 2 (P3) \u2192 avg \u22481.67. No confirmed lost shipments. Set L to be calculated from observed lead times to reflect the mixed regime. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, aligning safety stock to the inferred lead-time and overall demand variability while avoiding overfitting to short-term noise.

Carry-over insight: Observed lead time regime is mixed (observed values 2,1,2 \u2192 average \u22481.67); no confirmed lost shipments. Evidence: arrivals recorded in Periods 3 and 5.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/25 (Period 7). Recent concluded arrivals show observed lead times = 2 (P1->P3), 1 (P2->P3), 2 (P3->P5), 2 (P4->P6) -> mixed but averaging \u22481.75. No confirmed lost shipments. On-hand=103, in-transit=502. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the average observed lead time (captures the mixed 1\u20132 period regime). For demand I use 'default' (1+L times mean of all samples) and for sigma use 'default' (sqrt(1+L) times std) so the OR engine raises replenishment to cover the longer inferred pipeline while letting its capped cap limit extreme orders. This balances higher service need from multi-period lead times against holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Observed lead-time regime shifted to mixed 1\u20132 periods; observed lead times = [2,1,2,2], average \u22481.75 (Periods 3 and 5 and 6 arrivals confirm). No lost shipments detected.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). Recent arrival history shows observed lead times = [2,1,2,2] (avg \u22481.75) with no lost shipments; on-hand=0, in-transit=705. Demand has been higher recently (periods 3\u20137 demands = 301,278,250,216,253) so I use a recent-window demand estimate to capture the current regime. Set L using the most recent 4 observed lead times to reflect the mixed 1\u20132 period regime. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 demand samples (periods 3\u20137) to capture recent elevated mean and volatility; this balances service level given pipeline stock while avoiding excess holding cost.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). Recent demand samples = [267,298,307,189,122]; on-hand=0, in-transit=520. Observed lead times from concludes = [2,1,2,2,3] \u2192 average \u22482.0 with an occasional 3-period delay (Period5\u2192arrived in Period8). No confirmed lost shipments. To capture the mixed but lengthened lead-time regime I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the observed average lead time. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, which balances service level for the longer inferred lead time against holding cost given modest profit/holding ratio.

Carry-over insight: Observed lead-time regime shifted upward: observed lead times = [2,1,2,2,3], average \u22482.0; occasional 3-period delays observed (Period5\u2192Period8 arrival).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). Recent demand samples = [267,298,307,189,122] (mean ~236.6); current on-hand=246, in-transit=390 (pipeline=636). Observed lead times from concluded messages (by arrival): [2,1,2,2,3,3,2] showing an upward shift with multiple 3-period delays; recent window shows average >2. I select L as recent_N (N=5) to capture the upward lead-time trend while limiting noise. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat = default so the OR backend uses (1+L)\xd7historical mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std; this balances service level given elevated pipeline and higher observed lead-time volatility while avoiding overfit to very recent demand spikes.

Carry-over insight: Observed lead time has increased with intermittent 3-period delays; recent observed lead times [2,1,2,2,3,3,2], recent average \u22482.14 \u2014 treat lead-time regime as shifted upward.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22): on-hand=77, in-transit=549. Historical concluded arrivals show intermittent 3-period delays and recent observed lead-times averaging \u22482.14 (evidence: observed lead times [2,1,2,2,3,3,2] from Periods 3\u201310 arrivals). To be conservative against missed/longer shipments, set L explicit to 2.14. Demand shows recent variability; use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus forecasting on the latest regime (balances service level vs holding cost given elevated lead-time uncertainty). This keeps orders responsive to recent demand while the explicit longer L increases pipeline cover to protect against further delayed arrivals.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). On-hand=0, in-transit=552. History shows rising/intermittent 3-period delays (arrivals from Periods 5,6,8,11 indicate lead_times of 3). To be conservative against lost/late shipments and protect service, set lead time explicitly to 3. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to base demand across review+lead on the most recent full sample set; use default sigma_hat to let backend scale volatility by sqrt(1+L). This raises target replenishment to cover the longer effective lead time and balances service vs holding given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

Carry-over insight: Observed lead times have shifted upward with intermittent 3-period delays (evidence: arrivals showing lead_time=3 for orders placed in Periods 5,6,8,10/11); treat lead-time regime as increased versus promised 2 periods.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). Recent concluded arrivals show intermittently lengthened lead times (observed lead_times: 2,1,2,2,3,3,2,3,1,3 \u2192 multiple 3-period arrivals since Period 8) and average trending above promised 2. On-hand=0, in-transit=776 (large pipeline) and repeated late arrivals suggest using a longer effective L to avoid under-ordering. I set L explicit=3 to reflect the recent upward shift and intermittent 3-period delays. I leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR backend applies (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples) respectively, letting the backend scale forecast and safety stock consistently with the longer lead time and observed demand history.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime has shifted upward with intermittent 3-period delays (evidence: multiple concluded arrivals showing lead_time=3 since Period 8); treat effective lead time > promised (use L\u22483) until contradicted by concluded arrivals.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13. Demand history shows intermittent but sustained 3-period arrivals since Period 8; on-hand=0, in-transit=1034. Evidence (concluded arrivals) indicates effective lead time > promised 2. To avoid stockouts given large in-transit but longer effective lead time, set L explicit=3 so backend sizes base-stock across a longer pipeline. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given uncertain but elevated lead time.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime has shifted upward to ~3 periods (multiple concluded arrivals with lead_time=3 since Period 8); treat effective L\u22483 until contradicted by concluded arrivals.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20 (Period 15). Historical concluded arrivals show multiple 3-period lead times since Period 8 (orders from Periods 5,6,8,10/11 concluded with lead_time=3). On-hand=174, in-transit=709. Evidence supports treating effective lead time above promised 2. I set L explicitly to 3 to account for persistent 3-period delays; mu_hat and sigma_hat use defaults so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples), respectively, providing a conservative order target covering the longer review+lead horizon and increased variability.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime shifted upward to ~3 periods (evidence: multiple concluded arrivals with lead_time=3 since Period 8); treat effective L\u22483 until contradicted by future concluded arrivals.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). Recent concluded arrivals show multiple lead_time=3 since Period 8 (e.g. Period5\u21928, Period6\u21929, Period8\u219211, Period12\u219215), indicating effective lead time has increased above the promised 2. On-hand=3, in-transit=819 \u2014 substantial pipeline but observed delays justify planning for L=3 to avoid stockouts when arrivals shift later. I set L explicit=3 to reflect the sustained 3-period delays; mu_hat and sigma_hat use default formulas so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean(samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(samples), which scales demand and uncertainty over the longer review+lead horizon and raises target base-stock to balance service (profit $2 vs holding $1) against holding cost.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). On-hand=0, in-transit=977. Historical concluded arrivals show multiple 3-period lead times since Period 8 (orders placed in Periods 5,8,10/11 etc.), indicating an upward shift in effective lead time. To avoid stockouts given zero on-hand and large pipeline with delayed arrivals, set L explicitly to 3 (treat effective lead time as 3). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, producing a larger base stock and safety buffer under the longer lead time.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime has shifted upward to \u22483 periods (evidence: multiple concluded arrivals showing lead_time=3 since Period 8; treat effective L\u22483 until contradicted).

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10 (Period 18). Recent concluded arrivals show multiple lead_time=3 events since Period 8 (e.g. Period5\u21928, Period6\u21929, Period8\u219211, Period10/11 arrivals), indicating effective lead time has shifted above the promised 2. On-hand=0 but large in-transit=867. To avoid under-ordering given observed 3-period delays, set L explicitly to 3. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history; this raises target base-stock and caps conservatively to cover the longer effective pipeline while balancing holding cost.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). Recent concluded arrivals show multiple lead_time=3 events since Period 8 (evidence in conclude messages: Periods 8,9,11,19 arrivals with lead_time=3), on-hand=0, in-transit=811. This indicates effective lead time has increased above the promised 2; to avoid under-ordering given current pipeline and recurring 3-period delays, set L explicitly to 3. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all historical samples, which balances service level against holding cost with the longer lead time and substantial in-transit stock.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). On-hand=0, in-transit=1046. Historical concluded arrivals show persistent intermittent 3-period delays since Period 8 (multiple concluded arrivals with lead_time=3); no evidence of lost shipments. Given elevated observed lead times (~3) I set L explicitly to 3 to force the OR engine to cover the longer effective pipeline. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, letting the engine balance service vs. holding cost with the updated L. This mitigates stockouts from underestimated lead time while relying on demand history for sizing.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime shifted upward to ~3 periods (evidence: multiple concluded arrivals with lead_time=3 since Period 8); treat effective L\u22483 until contradicted by future concluded arrivals.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-08). On-hand=43, in-transit=804. Concluded arrivals since Period 8 show recurring lead_time=3 (orders placed in Periods 5,6,8,10/11 etc.), indicating effective lead time has shifted above the promised 2. To avoid stockouts given large in-transit but longer effective lead time, set L explicitly to 3 so backend increases review+lead demand window. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all historical samples, yielding a larger base stock and wider safety stock to trade higher service vs holding cost under the confirmed longer lead-time regime.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime shifted upward to ~3 periods (multiple concluded arrivals with lead_time=3 since Period 8); treat effective L\u22483 until contradicted by future concluded arrivals.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=0, in-transit=995 (large pipeline). I set L explicit=3 to reflect the sustained upward lead-time regime and avoid underordering for the longer pipeline. Using mu_hat default and sigma_hat default lets the OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from historical samples, which balances higher safety stock for the longer lead time against holding cost given the large existing in-transit volume.

Period 24 (2019-07-22). On-hand=0, in-transit=862. Concluded arrivals since Period 8 include multiple lead_time=3 events (e.g. Period5\u21928, 6\u21929, 8\u219211, 16\u219219), signaling a sustained upward shift in effective lead time vs promised 2. To avoid under-ordering given invisible in-transit delays, set L explicitly to 3. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, which scales safety stock with the longer inferred lead time while keeping demand estimates anchored to historical data.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=0, in-transit=1085. Multiple concluded arrivals since Period 8 show lead_time=3 (e.g. Periods where orders placed in 5,6,8,10/11 led to 3-period arrivals); recent history indicates effective lead time has shifted from promised 2\u2192\u22483. Given large in-transit stock but persistent 3-period delays, set L explicit=3 so the OR backend plans over the longer pipeline. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from demand samples; this keeps forecasting anchored to full-sample stats while the longer L raises coverage for delayed arrivals, balancing service level vs holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime shifted upward to ~3 periods (evidence: multiple concluded arrivals with lead_time=3 since Period 8); treat effective L\u22483 until contradicted by future concluded arrivals.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 Period27. On-hand=0, in-transit=1025. History of concluded arrivals shows multiple lead_time=3 events since Period8 -> effective lead time elevated vs promised. To avoid stockouts given large recent 3-period delays, set L explicitly to 3. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from historical samples; this keeps forecasts tied to observed demand while accounting for longer effective lead time. Large in-transit stock reduces immediate ordering aggressiveness.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime shifted upward to ~3 periods (multiple concluded arrivals with lead_time=3 since Period 8); treat effective L\u22483 until contradicted by future concluded arrivals.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Historical concluded arrivals show persistent intermittent 3-period delays since Period 8; in-transit=1067 units, on-hand=0 so pipeline is large but arrivals have been delayed. Given sustained upward shift in observed lead times (multiple concluded lead_time=3), set lead time explicitly to 3 to avoid under-ordering. Demand has increased and become more variable in recent periods (several large demands >300); use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand regime while avoiding old low samples. This increases target base-stock to protect service level under longer effective L while sigma_recent captures heightened volatility for safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime shifted upward to ~3 periods (multiple concluded arrivals showing lead_time=3 since Period 8); treat effective L\u22483 until contradicted by future concluded arrivals.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26 (Period 29). Recent concluded arrivals show frequent 3-period lead times since Period 8 (multiple concluded arrivals with lead_time=3), so effective lead time appears increased above the promised 2. On-hand=0, in-transit=1127 \u2014 substantial pipeline but longer effective L increases the (1+L) demand coverage needed. I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect the persistent 3-period delays. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all historical samples, which balances higher safety stock need from longer lead time against holding cost given large in-transit volume.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime shifted upward to ~3 periods (multiple concluded arrivals showing lead_time=3 since Period 8); treat effective L\u22483 until contradicted by future concluded arrivals.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/2 (Period 30). Demand history shows high variability and many stockouts recently; on-hand=0, in-transit=1127. Concluded arrivals since Period 8 include multiple lead_time=3 observations -> effective lead time has shifted above the promised 2. To protect service level given large in-transit and confirmed 3-period delays, set L explicitly to 3. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full historical samples, avoiding overfitting to recent stockout-distorted demands. This balances holding vs. stockout risk given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-09 Period31. Historical concluded arrivals show persistent intermittent 3-period delays since Period 8; effective lead-time regime has increased above the promised 2 and clusters around 3. On-hand=1, in-transit=1025 (large pipeline) \u2014 risk of overstock if L underestimated, and lost shipments not indicated. I set L explicit=3 to reflect the observed shifted lead-time regime so the OR backend plans across the longer pipeline. I kept mu_hat and sigma_hat as default ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) so the backend uses the full-sample demand estimates scaled for the chosen L; this balances service level against holding cost given the large in-transit volume.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-16 (Period 32). On-hand=0, in-transit=1025. Historical concluded arrivals show repeated 3-period lead times since Period 8 (multiple concluded arrivals with lead_time=3), so effective lead time appears shifted above the promised 2. To avoid underordering given large in-transit but longer actual delays, set L explicitly to 3. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean(samples) and sqrt(1+L)*std(samples) \u2014 this leverages full historical demand (samples mean\u2248236.6) while the larger L inflates the forecast window to cover review+lead. This balances service (longer L raises base stock) against holding cost; large in-transit (1025) should prevent excessive new orders but the OR backend will cap orders using its cap rule.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). On-hand=0, in-transit=1025. Historical concluded arrivals show a sustained shift to intermittent 3-period lead times since Period 8; promised lead time=2 is no longer reliable. To protect service level given large pipeline but longer effective delays, set lead time explicitly to 3. Use default demand and volatility aggregation so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting the OR engine size base stock and cap given the updated L. This balances higher safety stock for longer lead time against holding cost while accounting for large in-transit volume.

High in-transit inventory is noted \u2014 OR's capped ordering will limit new receipts.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/10/21 (Period 37). Historical concluded arrivals show persistent intermittent 3-period delays since Period 8; effective lead time appears to be ~3 rather than promised 2. To avoid stockouts given large pipeline (1067) and elevated/volatile demand history, set L explicitly to 3 so OR backend sizes safety stock for the longer regime. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from the historical demand samples (keeps forecast anchored to observed data while letting the longer L inflate review+lead demand and variability). This addresses missing/late shipments by building extra pipeline cover without manual overrides to demand estimates.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime shifted upward to ~3 periods (evidence: multiple concluded arrivals with lead_time=3 since Period 8); treat effective L\u22483 until contradicted by future concluded arrivals.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Recent concluded arrivals show multiple lead_time=3 observations since Period 8 \u2192 effective lead time has shifted above promised 2. On-hand=0, in-transit=1058 (sizable pipeline). I will treat L=3 to capture the upward lead-time regime and avoid underordering. Use default demand aggregation so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; with L=3 this balances higher safety stock need vs holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime shifted upward to ~3 periods (multiple concluded arrivals with lead_time=3 since Period 8); treat effective L\u22483 until contradicted by future concluded arrivals.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=0, in-transit=1058 \u2014 ample pipeline but observed concluded arrivals since Period 8 show frequent 3-period delays. Historical concluded lead times cluster around 3 in recent history, so I treat effective lead time as 3 to avoid under-ordering. Use mu_hat and sigma_hat defaults so backend computes demand over the (1+L) review+lead horizon from full sample history; this balances service-level vs holding cost given large pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime shifted upward to ~3 periods (multiple concluded arrivals showing lead_time=3 since Period 8); treat effective L\u22483 until contradicted by future concluded arrivals.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/11 (Period 40). On-hand=0, in-transit=1058. Historical concluded arrivals show a persistent upward shift in observed lead times with multiple lead_time=3 conclusions since Period 8; effective lead-time regime \u22483. To avoid under-ordering given delayed arrivals, set lead time explicitly to 3. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from demand samples with the revised L; this increases target base-stock and safety stock to compensate for longer effective lead time and protect service level while balancing holding cost.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18. Historical concluded arrivals show frequent 3-period lead times since Period 8 (multiple concluded arrivals with lead_time=3), on-hand=0, in-transit=1058. Evidence supports treating effective lead time > promised 2; using explicit L=3 to ensure pipeline covers additional delay. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, which balances service level given higher effective L while leveraging full historical demand data.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date=2019-11-25 (Period 42). Historical concluded arrivals show a persistent upward shift in observed lead times to ~3 periods since Period 8; no evidence of lost shipments. Demand sample mean (provided) = 236.6. Given effective lead-time \u22483, set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed regime. Use an explicit mu_hat based on (1+L)\xd7mean = 4\xd7236.6 = 946.4 to ensure pipeline covers the longer replenishment window and upcoming demand; keep sigma_hat as default (backend will scale sample std by sqrt(1+L)) so volatility is adjusted for the longer review+lead period.

Historical concluded arrivals show repeated lead_time=3 since Period 8, indicating effective lead-time has shifted upward versus the promised 2. To avoid stockouts given long pipeline and observed 3-period delays, set L explicitly to 3. Use default demand estimators for mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this leverages full history while the explicit L captures the prolonged delays and prevents under-ordering despite in-transit inventory that may arrive later than promised.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). On-hand=0, in-transit=1062. Concluded arrivals since Period 8 show frequent 3-period lead_times \u2014 effective lead time has shifted above promised 2 to ~3. Demand is high and volatile recently (many large weekly demands through Nov\u2013Dec). To avoid stockouts given longer effective L, set L explicitly to 3. For demand forecast use recent_N (N=5) to capture the latest demand regime while limiting noise; same N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime shifted upward to \u22483 periods (multiple concluded arrivals with lead_time=3 since Period 8); treat effective L\u22483 until contradicted by future concluded arrivals.

On-hand=0, in-transit=1398 \u2014 substantial pipeline that likely covers multiple future periods. To account for the observed higher lead-time regime and avoid stockouts from delayed arrivals, set L explicitly to 3. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, preserving statistical grounding while the larger L raises required pipeline cover. No concluded evidence of lost shipments; large in-transit reduces need for aggressive uplift in mu_hat.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30. On-hand=0, in-transit=1398. Historical concluded arrivals repeatedly show lead_time=3 since Period 8 (multiple confirmations), so effective lead time > promised. Set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed regime and avoid under-ordering. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level given long effective lead time and large pipeline while letting OR engine cap orders via its cap logic.
