Period 47 (2019/12/30) Hybrid Decision:
============================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: concluded history shows supplier actual lead time = 0 periods (orders from Periods 1\u201346 all arrived same period), so same-period arrivals are reliable. Inventory & demand analysis: on-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must cover this period's demand entirely via today's order. Historical samples show elevated late-Nov/Dec demand; carry-over notes indicate recent Nov\u2013Dec average \u2248338 units (Periods 40\u201344). OR recommends 299 units (uses long-run history), which is below the observed holiday/regime demand. Strategy: with lead time = 0 the order will arrive before demand, and holding cost is moderate ($1/unit/period) vs profit $2/unit, so slight overstocking to avoid lost sales is warranted. I increase OR's 299 to 340 units to match recent realized demand levels (~338) and align with recent ordering/sales (many orders/sales ~340 in Dec). Final action: order 340 units.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Increase OR's 299\u2192340 units because actual lead time=0 and recent Nov\u2013Dec demand averaged \u2248338 units; ordering 340 avoids stockouts during the holiday spike.",
