{
  "rationale": "Lead time & arrivals: carry-over confirms actual lead time = 0 (orders arrive same period). Inventory state: on-hand=20, in-transit=0 so we must pre-position inventory to meet same-period demand. Demand analysis: historical samples show variability but recent periods (P40\u2013P45) show sustained high demand: weekly demands = [387, 348, 311, 266, 380, 360], average \u2248342 units/week \u2014 ~35\u201340% above long-run typical levels. OR recommended 327 (uses promised L and historical mean). Given 0 lead time and current on-hand=20, I prioritize meeting elevated holiday demand this period to avoid lost sales (profit $4 > holding $1). Risk of extra holding cost is smaller than lost profit from stockouts. Action: increase OR's recommendation slightly to cover expected same-period demand (~360) so we can fill peak-week demand. Calculation: target \u2248 recent-week average 342 rounded up to 360 to be safe; order arrives this period and plus on-hand (20) gives availability ~380 vs expected demand ~360. Hence place order=360.",

Demand outlook: recent Nov\u2013Dec weeks show sustained spike (~avg 342/week, Periods 40\u201346) so current demand regime is elevated vs earlier-year historical samples. OR recommends 327 units; OR uses longer-run history and promised L, but with L=0 and current elevated demand we should at least meet the week's demand. Ordering 327 + on-hand 22 \u2248 349 units covers the observed elevated weekly demand (~342) while keeping safety stock modest given holding cost.
