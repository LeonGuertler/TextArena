Shortfall = 1,402 - 346 = 1,056 units to cover next 5 periods. OR baseline: recommends 440 (uses historical mean and promised L). Decision logic: recent demand regime is elevated and volatile versus OR's historical assumptions; with confirmed 4-period lead time I must replenish to avoid heavy lost-sales given high recent demand. I balance risk of overstock (holding cost $1/unit/period) against lost-sales profit ($2/unit). Rather than order full shortfall (1,056) which risks large holding cost if demand reverts, I increase OR's recommendation to materially raise pipeline while limiting downside. Final action: order 600 units (arrives in 4 periods) \u2014 raises pipeline+on-hand to 946, providing ~3.4 periods coverage at current elevated rate and reducing near-term stockout risk while limiting excess inventory if demand softens.",
