Promised lead time = 2 periods; no concluded arrivals observed yet, so treat actual lead time as 2 until evidence otherwise. Decision logic: with L=2 you must cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand when ordering now. Forecast next 3-period demand \u2248 3 \xd7 236.6 \u2248 710; round to nearest whole unit. Holding cost applies only when inventory is on-hand (orders are in-transit until arrival), so ordering now to cover 3 periods is appropriate despite holding cost. No in-transit or on-hand inventory to cover current periods; orders will first arrive in Period 3 and satisfy that period and subsequent demand.
