With LT=4, decision must cover current period demand plus next 4 periods (L+1=5 periods) because arrivals occur after demand. e) Order logic: target coverage = mean demand * (L+1) \u2248237*5 \u22481185 units.

In-transit=1500 equals orders in Periods 41\u201344 (630+480+180+210); these arrivals will occur in Periods 45\u201348 (arrivals happen after decision). Decision math: must cover L+1 = 5 periods of demand (current period + 4 until a new order placed now would arrive). 5 * 325 \u2248 1625 units required. Current on-hand + in-transit = 0 + 1500 = 1500 \u2192 shortfall \u2248 125 units. Trade-off: profit $2/unit vs holding $1/unit/period \u2014 avoid large excess. Order a modest buffer above shortfall to protect service level. Final action: order 150 units.",

Inventory assessment: on-hand 270 + in-transit 1020 = 1290 units currently covering ~4 periods at 325/unit (needs ~1625 for L+1=5 periods). Decision logic: target cover (L+1) periods demand = 5 * 325 = 1625. Shortfall \u2248 335.
