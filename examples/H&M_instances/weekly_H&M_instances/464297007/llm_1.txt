No current-period sales history yet to indicate a regime change. c) Lead time / in-transit: Promised lead time = 4 periods. On-hand = 0, in-transit = 0, and no concluded arrivals observed yet, so assume supplier will follow promised lead time until evidence shows otherwise. d) Inventory & pipeline: With lead time L=4, decision must cover demand for (L+1)=5 periods (current period demand occurs after decision). e) Order logic: Use historical mean as baseline, adjust modestly upward for likely Valentine\u2019s uplift this period. Baseline 237 \xd7 5 = 1185 units to cover five periods of demand. This balances service (avoid stockout during a probable short spike) vs. holding cost given high expected turnover.

  "rationale": "World/calendar: Date 2019-12-23 (week before Christmas) likely increases apparel/gift demand for womens underwear. Product fits seasonal gift/holiday uplift.

Use conservative elevated forecast ~350 units/period. Lead time & pipeline: confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (consistent historical evidence). On-hand = 29, in-transit = 1221 => pipeline total = 1250. Decision horizon: must cover L+1 = 5 periods of demand (current period demand occurs after decision). Demand coverage target = 350 * 5 = 1750 units. Order need = max(0, target - pipeline) = 1750 - 1250 = 500. Risk tradeoff: profit $4 > holding $1, so favor stocking to meet holiday demand; ordering 500 balances service vs. holding. No evidence of lost shipments currently. Final: order 500 to arrive in Period 50 (covers next 5 periods at forecasted elevated demand).",
