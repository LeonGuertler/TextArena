  "rationale": "World/calendar: Period date 2019-12-30 (pre-New Year) \u2014 recent demand elevated. Demand regime: recent periods P40\u2013P46 show high demand (387, 348, 311, 266, 380, 360, 358) and prior insight (P42) set baseline \u2248270\u2013280 but current realized demand is ~350 units/period; use ~350 as short-term forecast. Lead time & pipeline: carry-over shows actual LT uncertain 1\u20133 periods; plan for up to 3-period delays, so protect (L+1)=4 periods of demand. Inventory math: on-hand=0, in-transit=1200. Coverage needed = 4 * 350 = 1400 \u2192 shortfall = 200. Tradeoff: profit $2/unit vs holding $1/unit/period; minimal incremental order to cover forecasted shortfall. Action: order 200 units to cover 4 periods of expected demand while avoiding excessive holding costs.",
