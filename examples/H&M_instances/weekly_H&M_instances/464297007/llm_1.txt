Lead time promised = 2 periods; no arrivals seen yet so assume promised lead time until contradicted.

With on-hand=0 and in-transit=0, place order for 720 units.

We placed 720 in P1; it is in-transit and scheduled to arrive during P3 but the arrival will only be visible in the P3 conclude (read at P4). No concluded arrivals yet, so actual LT and loss risk are unconfirmed. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, in-transit=720. 720 covers multiple periods of expected demand (720 / ~240 \u2248 3 periods). Ordering now would create additional pipeline and increase holding cost risk if the P1 shipment arrives. e) Final order logic: Do not place new order this period.
