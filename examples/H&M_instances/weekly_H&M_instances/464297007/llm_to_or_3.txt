Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11 (just before Valentine\u2019s Day) \u2014 historical weekly-like samples = [267,298,307,189,122]. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 and no concluded arrivals to infer lead-time. Promised L=2 used. Anticipate a short-term demand uplift for lingerie around Feb 14; I increase the (1+L)-period demand forecast explicitly to cover that spike. sigma_hat left as default to let backend scale volatility from history.

Carry-over insight: Expected short-term demand uplift around Feb 14 (Valentine effect); raise forecast for current replenishment cycle accordingly.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent observed conclude shows Period 1 order (427) has not arrived (arrived=0) \u2014 no confirmed lead-time change yet. On-hand=0, in-transit=427 (expected to cover future demand if arrives). Historic sample demands = [267,298,307,189,122]; include Valentine uplift noted previously but no new sustained changepoint. Use promised/default lead time and default demand estimates so OR backend applies (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std across all samples, keeping policy stable while awaiting arrival confirmation.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). On-hand=0, in-transit=729 (427+302) \u2014 both previous orders are still in-transit and not yet concluded, so actual lead time cannot be inferred from conclude messages. Promised lead time=2 remains appropriate. Historical demand samples = [267,298,307,189,122]; no clear recent changepoint in demand. Maintain default estimators so backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std, which balances service level given profit/holding tradeoff and avoids overreacting while in-transit shipments are unresolved. This also preserves safety stock to cover the current review+lead period (including expected short Valentine uplift flagged earlier).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04 (Period 4). Historical demands [267,298,307,189,122] show recent high variance; current on-hand=428 + in-transit=74 but past shipments: Period3 conclude reports arrivals from Period1 (lead_time=2) and Period2 (lead_time=1). Average observed lead_time = 1.5 \u2192 use calculated average to capture mixed lead-time behavior and potential partial delays. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, giving a conservative replenishment that accounts for the inferred longer-than-zero lead time while letting OR engine balance profit vs holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $406.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). Recent realized demands in concludes show elevated mid-Feb to early-Mar demand (periods with 301, 278) after a Valentine uplift. Observed concluded lead_times = 2 (Period1\u21923) and 1 (Period2\u21923) so I infer average actual lead time rather than the promised value. On-hand=150 + in-transit=393 appears sufficient to cover (1+L) periods at expected demand, but arrivals have been variable (one recent zero arrival), so use the average observed lead time to reflect that variability. Use default demand/volatility estimators so the backend applies (1+L) scaling to the full-sample mean/std, keeping a balanced service level vs holding cost given profit=$2/hold=$1.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). On-hand=0, in-transit=602. Historical concluded lead times: 2 (P3 arrival from P1), 1 (P3 arrival from P2), 2 (P5 arrival from P3) \u2192 average lead time \u22481.67 periods. Demand history unchanged (samples: [267,298,307,189,122]). Use calculate for L to capture observed mean lead time > promised; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend scales demand mean/variance by (1+L) automatically. This balances service level (reflecting longer observed lead time) against holding cost given large in-transit volume; relying on backend defaults keeps conservative replenishment without overfitting short-term noise or the passed Valentine uplift.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). Recent demand has fallen from Feb peak (demands last periods: 159,373,301,278,250,216) and current on-hand=103, in-transit=502 (pipeline=605) so inventory is ample versus one-period demand. Observed concluded lead times = [2,1,2,2] (avg 1.75) with no lost shipments; stick with data-driven average lead-time for L. Use default demand/statistics (no recent N override) so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this keeps safety stock conservative while letting the OR engine cap orders given the large pipeline, balancing service and holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Observed concluded lead_times = 2,1,2,2 \u2192 average 1.75 periods; arrivals consistent (no lost shipments).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). On-hand=0, in-transit=705; recent history shows intermittent stockouts and variable demand. Observed concluded lead times (from conclude messages) average ~1.75 periods \u2192 use calculate to let backend use observed average. Demand shows a recent regime (high then falling with stockouts); use recent_N with N=5 to ground forecast in the most recent 5 demand observations and to capture current variability. Sigma uses recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility rather than long-run std.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/8 (post-Valentine). Recent on-hand=0, in-transit=520 (large pipeline). Concluded lead_times observed = [2,1,2,2,3] (most recent included a 3-period delay), indicating increased lead-time variability. Recent demand (last 5 periods: P4\u2013P8) = [278,250,216,253,283], mean\u2248256, higher than older baseline. I choose L=recent_N (N=5) to capture the recent mix of 1\u20133 period deliveries. I choose mu_hat=recent_N (N=5) to base the replenishment target on the most recent demand regime (uses (1+L)*recent mean). I choose sigma_hat=recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent demand volatility. With these choices the backend will size base stock to recent demand and account for observed lead-time variability, while the cap limits single-period ordering given the large in-transit volume.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time variability increased: observed lead_times [2,1,2,2,3]; recent arrival with lead_time=3 indicates occasional 3-period delay \u2014 treat lead time as variable around 2 with occasional 3.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15. Recent concluded lead-times show increasing variability with several 3-period arrivals in the most recent observations (sequence of observed lead_times: 2,1,2,2,3,3,2). To capture the recent shift toward longer tails while remaining responsive, I use recent_N for L (N=5) to weight the last 5 observed lead-times (avg \u22482.4). On-hand (246) + in-transit (366)=612 is ample versus typical demand, so keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default to let the backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this prevents over-ordering while the backend's capped policy limits order size.

Demand history shows no new sustained shift; use default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and default volatility to let OR backend compute base-stock given the inferred L. High in-transit already present so no explicit mu/sigma scaling here; using defaults lets capped ordering policy and existing pipeline determine final order and mitigates risk from occasional 3-period delays.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). On-hand=0, in-transit=605. Historical concluded lead_times = [2,1,2,2,3,3,2,3] (avg=2.25) with last 5 = [2,3,3,2,3] (avg=2.6) showing recent upward shift and higher variability (occasional 3-period delays). Demand history samples [267,298,307,189,122], mean=236.6. To protect service given observed longer/variable lead times and upcoming short-term demand drivers noted previously (Valentine uplift earlier), I set L using a recent_N estimate (N=5) to reflect the recent regime (~2.6 \u2192 treated as >2). mu_hat and sigma_hat use default formulas so the OR backend will scale demand (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using the inferred L; this increases order targets to cover the longer/variable lead times while the capped policy limits over-ordering.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime shifted upward and more variable since early April: concluded lead_times sequence [2,1,2,2,3,3,2,3]; recent 5-period average=2.6 indicating frequent occasional 3-period delays. Treat lead time as variable around 2 with upward bias until proven otherwise.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). On-hand=0, in-transit=613. Recent concluded lead-times show variability with upward bias and occasional 3-period delays; use a recent estimate to capture current regime. Demand has been elevated and volatile in the last 5 periods (Period8-12: [283,176,169,176,323]) \u2014 use recent_N=5 for forecasting and volatility to respond to the recent spike (incl. Valentine/seasonal uplift earlier). Setting L=recent_N(5) captures the recent upward-biased lead-time regime; mu_hat=recent_N(5) uses the last 5-period mean to scale (1+L) forecast appropriately; sigma_hat=recent_N(5) uses recent volatility to size safety stock. These choices prioritize service during observed higher demand and variable/longer lead-times while limiting excess hold given on-hand=0 and large in-transit.

LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=0, in-transit=731. Recent concluded lead_times show upward bias with occasional 3-period delays (recent 5-period avg ~2.6). To capture this variability I set L using recent_N=5 (captures the recent regime). Demand samples are limited; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting the OR engine size base-stock while capping orders. This balances higher service target for sporadic longer lead times against holding cost given large in-transit inventory.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). Recent concluded history shows lead-time elevated and variable with frequent 3-period delays; pipeline large (on-hand 11, in-transit 603) but arrivals have recently spanned 1\u20133 periods. To capture the upward-biased, variable lead-time and the most recent demand regime, use recent_N=5 for lead-time, demand forecast (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat). This biases orders toward covering (1+L) periods of the latest demand while letting the OR backend compute safety stock given profit/holding tradeoff.

To hedge upward-biased/variable lead time while letting the OR engine compute demand scaling, set L using recent lead-time evidence. Use default demand/volatility calculations so backend applies (1+L) scaling to mean/std across samples. This balances service (accounting for occasional 3-period delays) against holding cost given large pipeline inventory.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). On-hand=0, in-transit=743 => substantial pipeline but recent concludes show variable lead times trending above promised 2 (recent 5-period avg ~2.6 with occasional 3). Demand has been elevated and volatile in recent weeks (multiple stockouts). Use recent-5 estimates to capture the upward-shifted lead-time regime and recent demand level/volatility so the OR backend increases target base-stock and cap to avoid lost sales while recognizing holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime shifted upward and more variable since early April; recent 5-period average lead_time \u22482.6 with frequent occasional 3-period delays. Treat lead time as variable around 2 with upward bias until proven otherwise.

LLM Rationale:

Concluded history shows lead-time variability with recent occasional 3-period delays; recent 5-period average lead_time ~2.6 so I bias L upward using recent data. Demand has been ~steady recently (last 5 demands = 122,151,171,200,154; mean\u2248159.6). To capture recent regime and limit stockouts given variable lead time, set L based on recent 5 observed lead-times and use recent-5 demand/statistics for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend sizes base-stock around current demand regime and volatility while the cap prevents extreme orders despite large pipeline.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/17 (Period 19). Recent concluded arrivals show lead_times = [2,3,1,2,2,3,...] with increasing frequency of 3-period delays; pipeline=734, on-hand=0. To capture the recent upward bias and variability in lead time I set L to recent_N (N=5) to let backend average the last 5 observed lead_times. Demand history is limited but stable; use default (all-sample) demand moments so mu_hat and sigma_hat scale with the chosen L. This raises target base-stock to cover the longer, variable lead time while sigma_hat default preserves observed volatility; helps avoid stockouts from occasional 3-period delays while limiting excess holding via OR's cap.

To account for upward-shifting, variable lead time use recent data for L. Demand has been volatile with recent large spikes; use recent_N for demand mean and std (focus on last 5 periods) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect current high-demand regime. These parameters raise target base-stock to cover the thicker pipeline and reduce stockouts while controlling holding cost by using recent volatility.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-01 (Period 21). On-hand=0, in-transit=941. Historical demand samples (seed) = [267,298,307,189,122]. Concluded lead-times through Period 20 show increasing variability with recent observations including multiple 3-period delays; recent 5-period average lead_time \u2248 2.6, indicating an upward-biased, variable lead-time regime and occasional 3-period delays. To protect service given large in-transit stock but variable/longer arrivals, I set L explicitly to 2.6 (captures upward bias). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) so mu_hat reflects the latest demand samples without over-weighting older data. Sigma_hat uses default to scale sample volatility for the (1+L) review+lead window. These choices increase target base-stock to buffer against occasional 3-period delays while using recent demand to avoid overstating demand-driven orders.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime shifted upward and more variable since early April; recent 5-period average lead_time \u2248 2.6 with frequent occasional 3-period delays \u2014 treat lead time as variable around 2 with an upward bias until proven otherwise.

Pipeline is large but arrivals have been irregular; to guard against occasional 3-period delays use a recent average lead time. Demand has been volatile recently with high spikes; use recent data to set demand forecast and volatility. Chosen methods: L as recent_N to reflect recent upward-shifted lead-time regime; mu_hat and sigma_hat as recent_N to base (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility on the most recent demand regime (N=5). These choices increase protected stock for higher/variable demand and occasional longer delays while avoiding overreaction to older data.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date=2019-07-29 (Period 25). Recent history shows frequent 2\u20133 period actual lead times with a recent 5-period average \u22482.6 and occasional 3-period delays; significant recent demand volatility and several high-demand weeks (periods 19,22,23). To protect service while acknowledging longer/more variable lead time and recent uplift, set L explicit=2.6. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend weights the latest high-demand regime (last 5 demand samples: 261,201,341,422,135). This raises the (1+L) forecast and measured volatility to keep pipeline coverage for the extended lead-time and avoid stockouts given the in-transit stock (988 units) and zero on-hand.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05. On-hand=0, in-transit=1072 (ample pipeline). Historical concludes show lead-times trending above promised 2 with frequent 3s; recent 5-period average \u22482.6. To account for upward-biased, variable lead time and avoid under-ordering, set L explicitly to 2.6. Given ample in-transit stock and no strong recent demand regime change (historical samples used by backend), use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, keeping forecasts consistent with historical variability while the explicit L raises the covered demand horizon.

To capture upward-biased, variable lead time use recent_N=5 for L. Demand history is noisy with recent high peaks; use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend weights the most recent regime.

To protect against these occasional 3-period delays, set L using recent_N over last 5 observed lead times. Demand has been volatile with recent high spikes (several large demands in June\u2013July); use recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand regime. In-transit volume (791) is large but may include late arrivals; higher L and recent-based mu/sigma balance service level vs holding cost by increasing coverage for delayed arrivals while letting backend cap limit orders.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Recent concluded lead_times show upward bias and variability with occasional 3-period delays; pipeline is large (in-transit=858) while on-hand=0 so no immediate stockout risk but must plan for longer/more variable lead time. Choose L using recent_N to reflect the recent 5-period average lead_time (~2.6) and capture increased delay frequency. Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=5) to focus forecast/volatility on the most recent demand regime; this raises the base-stock to protect service given longer/more-variable lead times while sigma_hat recent_N captures higher demand variability so cap/order sizing limits over-ordering against holding cost.

Historical concluded lead_times show upward bias and occasional 3-period delays (recent 5-period avg \u22482.6). To protect service while accounting for variable lead time I set L explicitly to 2.6.

To account for the upward-biased, variable lead time while letting the OR engine compute replenishment using recent lead-time evidence, set L using recent_N=5. Demand history is limited (five samples provided); use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend uses all samples scaled by (1+L).

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/30. Recent history shows highly variable lead times with recent 5 concluded lead_times \u22482.6 (frequent 3-period delays) and several lost/no-arrival periods earlier; on-hand=0, in-transit=832. Demand recently spiked (Period 33 demand=692) so forecast must react quickly. I set L as recent_N (N=5) to capture the upward-biased, variable lead-time regime. I set mu_hat using EWMA_gamma (gamma=0.5) to weight recent large demand more heavily while retaining some smoothing. I set sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices aim to raise target base-stock to avoid stockouts given longer/more-variable lead times and the recent demand surge, while keeping volatility explicitly measured for the OR cap calculation.

Carry-over insight: NEW: Recent sharp demand spike in Period 33 (demand=692) \u2014 recent short-run demand elevated; treat demand as increased in short term until further data confirms reversion.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-07 (Period 35). Recent demand shows a large short-term spike in Period 33 (692) and elevated demand in Periods 33-34 (692,335). Lead times have been variable with occasional 3-period delays; recent short-run avg lead_time elevated. On-hand=0, in-transit=1433 (large pipeline) \u2014 pipeline likely covers several periods but variability and the recent spike warrant raising short-run forecast. Set L using recent_N to reflect recent observed lead-time regime; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (5) to capture the recent demand surge and volatility so the OR backend increases target base-stock and cap accordingly while relying on pipeline to absorb some of the risk.

Carry-over insight: NEW short-run demand spike: Period 33 demand=692; treat demand as elevated in short term until further data confirms reversion.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-14 (Period 36). Recent demand history shows a large short-term spike (P33=692, P34=335) but subsequent periods returned lower; lead times have trended upward and variable with occasional 3-period delays (recent observed lead_time average \u22482.6). On-hand=707 and in-transit=603 provide substantial coverage; however variable lead times risk stockouts if underestimated. I set L using recent_N over the last 5 observed lead-times to capture the upward bias and occasional 3s. For demand I use an EWMA (gamma=0.4) to upweight the recent spike while not overreacting to a single outlier. Sigma left as default to let the backend compute volatility from full history. These choices raise the target base-stock modestly to protect against delayed arrivals while limiting excess holding cost given already-large on-hand+pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Recent short-run demand spike: Period 33 demand=692 and elevated Period 34 demand=335 \u2014 treat demand as elevated short-term until further data confirms reversion.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date=2019/10/21 (Period 37). Recent history shows a short-run demand spike (P33=692, P34=335) then tapering (P35=123, P36=100). Lead times have been variable with frequent occasional 3-period delays; recent concluded lead-times support upward bias. To protect service during the short-term elevated demand while accounting for higher lead-time variability, I use recent data for all parameters: L based on recent lead-time observations (captures occasional 3s); mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent demand to inflate forecast and volatility over the replenishment+lead period.

Carry-over insight: NEW: Short-run demand elevated (P33=692, P34=335) \u2014 treat demand as increased in short term until further data confirms reversion.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). Recent history shows a short-term demand spike (P33=692, P34=335) with elevated but decaying demand afterwards (P35-37 = 123,100,124). Lead times have trended upward and become variable with occasional 3-period delays; recent 5-period average lead_time \u22482.6. To protect service during the current elevated short-run demand and account for higher/variable lead time (possible occasional 3-period delays), I select a recent-N lead time estimate (captures recent 3-day delays) and recent-N demand statistics (captures the spike). These choices increase target base-stock to reduce stockouts while letting the OR backend cap orders to limit overstock risk.

Carry-over insight: Lead time regime elevated and more variable; recent 5-period average lead_time \u22482.6 with frequent occasional 3-period delays. Short-run demand elevated (Period33=692, Period34=335); treat demand as increased short-term until further confirmation.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/4 (Period 39). Recent concluded lead-times show higher variability with frequent 3-period delays; recent 5-period avg \u22482.6 (upward bias vs promised=2). Short-run demand was spiked in Periods 33\u201334 but recent 5 demands (P34\u2013P38 = 335,123,100,124,115) show moderated but still-elevated short-term variability. Current inventory (on-hand 368 + in-transit 603 = 971) comfortably covers (1+L) periods of demand for L\u22482\u20133, so we can rely on recent observations to set parameters. Decisions: use recent_N=5 for L to capture recent upward bias and variability in lead time; use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor forecasts to the most recent demand regime (captures spike then reversion). This balances service (accounting for occasional 3-period delays) with holding cost given sizable pipeline already en route.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). Recent history: large spike in P33 (692) then elevated P34 (335) but last five demands (P35\u2013P39) = [123,100,124,115,241] show moderate demand; on-hand=127 + in-transit=603 -> healthy pipeline coverage. Concluded lead-times show frequent occasional 3-period delays; recent 5-period average \u22482.6 so I set L explicit=2.6 to reflect upward-biased, variable lead time. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor forecast/volatility to the most recent regime (post-spike stabilization). These choices raise required pipeline to buffer occasional 3-period delays while keeping forecasts tied to recent realized demand, balancing service level vs holding cost.

Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=0, in-transit=603. Historical concluded lead_times show recent variability with frequent 3-period delays (recent 5-period average \u22482.6); to capture upward-biased, variable lead time I use a recent window. Demand recently spiked (P33=692,P34=335) but subsequent periods (P35\u2013P39) show elevated but more moderate demand; use recent_N demand estimate to reflect short-run elevation while avoiding overreaction. sigma left as default to let backend scale volatility over (1+L). These settings balance service (avoid stockouts given long/variable lead time and large in-transit) versus holding cost.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). Recent history shows a volatile lead-time regime with frequent 3-period delays (recent 5-period avg \u22482.6) and a prior short-lived demand spike (Periods 33-34). On-hand=0, in-transit=673 (large pipeline). Because arrivals have been delayed more often than promised, I set lead time explicitly to the observed elevated mean (2.6) to force the OR engine to plan for longer arrival timing. Demand forecast uses an EWMA to weight recent elevated observations while damping one-off spikes (gamma=0.3). Demand volatility is raised explicitly to reflect observed demand and lead-time variability (higher service buffer). These parameters bias orders upward enough to cover the longer, variable lead time and elevated short-term demand while the large in-transit pipeline will cap immediate replenishment by the OR engine.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019/12/2). On-hand=0, in-transit=1173. Historical concluded lead_times show elevated and variable LT with recent 5-period average \u22482.6 (frequent 3-period delays). Recent demand spike in P33 (692) and elevated subsequent periods; last 10 demands remain above long-run mean, so short-run demand is elevated. Choose L=recent_N (N=5) to capture recent upward-biased lead-time regime. Choose mu_hat=recent_N (N=10) and sigma_hat=recent_N (N=10) to base forecast and volatility on the most recent 10 demand observations (captures recent spike but smooths across several periods). This increases target base-stock to protect service given longer/more variable LT while using recent demand to avoid overreacting to a single extreme period.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09 (Period 44). Recent concluded lead-times show increased variability with frequent 3-period delays; recent 5-period average \u22482.6. Recent demand (Periods 39-43 = [241,387,348,311,266]) is elevated versus long-run. To account for upward-biased, variable lead time and short-run higher demand, set L using recent_N (N=5) to reflect current lead-time regime; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to ground forecast and volatility on the latest elevated demand samples. This increases pipeline cover while keeping volatility estimate aligned with recent demand.

Historical concluded lead_times show frequent occasional 3-period delays and recent 5-period average \u22482.6 \u2014 I conservatively set L=3 to cover the upward-biased, variable lead-time regime and reduce risk of stockouts given large pipeline. Demand has been elevated in recent weeks (Periods 40-44: 387,348,311,266,380); to capture the short-run uplift I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) so the backend forecasts (1+L)*recent_mean and scales volatility by sqrt(1+L). This raises target base-stock to prioritize service while the explicit larger L tempers ordering frequency to account for slower arrivals and avoid underestimating pipeline needs.
