Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11 (mid-February). Product: women's thong underwear \u2014 modest seasonality (possible slight lift for Valentine's promotions this month). History: demands = [267,298,307,189,122]. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 \u2192 no arrivals pending; cannot infer actual lead time (no conclude messages). Promised lead time = 4 periods and no evidence of lost shipments. To balance service vs holding cost, use default lead time and population-wide demand estimates so OR backend uses full historical mean/variance. This raises target base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of mean demand while using historical volatility for safety stock.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/2/18. No concluded arrivals yet (order placed Period 1 still in-transit=367); promised lead time 4 remains best prior. Historical demand samples = [267,298,307,189,122], mean ~236.6. To balance service vs holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1, use baseline OR estimates: keep L as promised and use default demand/volatility aggregation so backend computes base_stock from full-sample mean and std scaled by (1+L). This ensures pipeline + on-hand cover (L+1) periods of expected demand while avoiding ad hoc changes before observing any concluded lead-time or demand regime shift.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Two recent orders (Periods 1\u20132) show arrived=0 despite promised L=4 \u2014 possible delayed or lost shipments, but no concluded arrivals to compute an empirical lead time yet. On-hand=0 + in-transit=719 < (1+L)*mean_demand (5*236.6\u22481183), so pipeline likely insufficient vs. typical 5-period demand; therefore keep L at promised (no concluded evidence to change). Use default demand/volatility (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample [267,298,307,189,122]) so the OR engine balances profit vs holding cost with full historical sample while we gather conclusive arrival info.

Carry-over insight: Possible shipment delays/losses: orders placed in Periods 1 and 2 show arrived=0 in their conclude messages (evidence: Period1 ordered=367 arrived=0; Period2 ordered=352 arrived=0). Monitor for missing concludes to confirm lost shipments.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Multiple consecutive conclude messages show no arrivals for orders placed in Periods 1-3 (evidence of delayed or lost shipments). On-hand=0, in-transit=1113 \u2014 pipeline exists but recent concludes suggest arrivals may be delayed beyond the promised 4 periods or lost. To be conservative I assume a longer effective lead time to force the OR engine to plan for a longer coverage window: set L explicitly to 6. Demand history shows mixed values with no clear recent upward spike; I use default demand and volatility calculations so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples, letting the OR engine produce a capped order that balances service vs holding given the longer L.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Multiple consecutive orders (Periods 1\u20134) have concluded with arrived=0, signaling probable shipment delays or losses versus the promised 4-period lead time. On-hand=0 but in-transit=1507 (likely undelivered). To protect service while acknowledging extended arrival risk, I increase assumed lead time so the optimizer holds more pipeline cover. I set L explicitly to 6 periods (conservative buffer beyond promised 4). Demand history shows mean ~236.6 units; no clear recent demand regime shift, so use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend will scale (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This raises base-stock to improve fill rates given suspected delivery delays while letting backend cap orders via its cap rule.

Daily Reward (R_t): $383.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-03-18. Demand context: historical samples [267,298,307,189,122] (mean\u2248236.6) with no obvious season/event this week. Conclude messages now show Period 5 arrival: 367 units (ordered Period 1) with lead_time=4 \u2014 this confirms actual lead time = promised 4 periods and suggests earlier zero-arrival concludes were in-transit rather than lost. On-hand=117, in-transit=1510 \u2014 pipeline is large. I therefore use default lead time (trust promised L=4) and default demand stats so the OR engine computes base_stock from full-sample mean/Std (conservative given large pipeline). This balances service (avoid stockouts given long pipeline) against holding cost by letting OR compute safety stock from observed variance.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time confirmed = 4 periods (evidence: Period 5 conclude: arrived=367 units ordered on Period 1, lead_time was 4). Previous suspected losses now explained as in-transit delay; monitor remaining outstanding orders for expected arrivals at their 4-period mark.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). Recent concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 (Period 5 conclude: arrival of 367 ordered Period 1, lead_time 4; Period 6 conclude: arrival of 352 ordered Period 2, lead_time 4). On-hand=253, in-transit=1158 \u2014 pipeline aligns with prior large orders now arriving on a 4-period cadence. Use promised/default lead time (4) and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes base_stock = (1+L)\xd7mean(samples) and volatility from all samples; this keeps service high given recent high demand and avoids manual overcorrection for now.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Context: Period 8 (2019-04-01). Recent conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (Period5 concluded arrival of Period1 order with lead_time=4; Period6 & Period7 similarly showed 4). On-hand = 394, in-transit = 764. Demand has settled lower recently (last 3 concluded demands: Period5=250, Period6=216, Period7=253) vs earlier volatility. Decision: set L to be inferred from observed lead times to reflect confirmed 4-period regime; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3 demand samples to capture the current lower-demand regime and recent variability so OR backend sizes orders to cover (1+L) periods of near-term demand while avoiding excess holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (evidence: Period5 conclude: arrived=367 units ordered on Period1, lead_time=4; subsequent arrives in Period6 and Period7 also match 4-period lag).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/8 (Period 9). Recent concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 periods for arrivals from Periods 1\u20134. On-hand=505, in-transit=431; pipeline + on-hand comfortably covers several periods but recent demand (Periods 4\u20138) is higher than older historical samples, indicating a regime shift upward. Set L by averaging observed lead times to reflect confirmed 4-period reality. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) use recent_N with N=5 to capture the most recent demand regime (Periods 4\u20138) and avoid diluting with older low-demand samples; this supports the OR engine producing a higher base stock to maintain service while the capped order limits control batch sizing and holding cost exposure.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent concludes consistently show orders arriving with a 4-period lag (multiple concluded arrivals: Period5/6/7/8/9 trace to orders placed 4 periods earlier). On-hand=699 and in-transit=361; promised L=4 and observed lead time=4, so use observed-average for L. Use default demand/volatility aggregation so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std from historical samples, providing a conservative base-stock that covers the review+lead horizon and captures historical variability while the pipeline (in-transit) is consumed.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-04-22 Period 11. On-hand=530, in-transit=607. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (arrivals from orders placed in Periods 1\u20135 all reported lead_time=4). No new lost-shipment signal. Demand history available; no clear recent regime shift. I choose default lead time so backend uses promised L, and default mu_hat/sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This keeps forecasts grounded in full-sample stats while honoring observed 4-period lead time and avoids overreacting to recent noise; it ensures pipeline + on-hand are compared against (1+L)-period demand by the OR engine.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). Demand has been volatile with a recent high (Period12 demand=323). On-hand=92, in-transit=844 \u2014 substantial pipeline but arrivals follow confirmed 4-period actual lead time. I keep L as default (promised=4) since concluded history consistently shows 4-period arrivals and no persistent losses. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the most recent demand regime (last 5 demands: 283,176,169,176,323) so the backend sizes the (1+L)-period forecast and uncertainty to recent volatility and the recent uptick. This balances service (avoid stockouts given heavy pipeline and recent spike) against holding cost by not using long-term averages that dilute the recent spike signal.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-05-13 Period 14. Product is seasonal basics (underwear); no special calendar events. History shows consistent confirmed arrivals with a 4-period lag (Periods 5\u20139 arrivals tied to orders 1\u20135). On-hand=270, in-transit=805 (large pipeline). I set L using observed lead times (confirmed = 4) so the OR engine uses empirically correct lead time. Demand and volatility will use defaults so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; with large pipeline on-hand this avoids over-ordering while preserving service given profit/holding tradeoff.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (evidence: Period5 conclude: arrived=367 units ordered on Period1, lead_time=4; subsequent arrivals in Period6 and Period7 match 4-period lag).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/3 (Period 17). Demand history and conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (arrivals in Periods 5\u201316 match 4-period lag). Current inventory: on-hand=292, in-transit=725 (pipeline consistent with 4-period lead). Given stable demand history with no recent regime shift and confirmed 4-period lead, use default statistics so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample set. This keeps service level aligned with observed lead time while avoiding overreacting to short-term noise.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/10 (Period 18). Historical arrivals consistently show a 4-period lag (orders placed in Periods 1\u201313 arrived in Periods 5\u201317 with lead_time=4). On-hand=399, in-transit=655 -> pipeline + on-hand is healthy but still rely on correct L. No strong demand regime shift in the recent demand samples (past demands: [267,298,307,189,122]); variability is moderate. Because actual lead time is confirmed at 4 and demand shows no clear recent changepoint, use the defaults so the OR engine computes base-stock from full-sample mean/SD with promised L=4. This balances service (use confirmed L) against holding cost (defaults avoid overreacting to noise).

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (evidence: arrivals in Periods 5\u201317 show ordered\u2192arrived with a 4-period lag; Period5 conclude: arrived=367 ordered on Period1 lead_time=4; subsequent arrivals through Period17 match 4-period lag).

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-17 (Period 19). Demand history (seed samples) shows mean ~237 units; recent concluded arrivals consistently show a 4-period lead time (many concluded messages from Period5\u201318 confirming a 4-period lag). On-hand=298 and in-transit=613 provide strong coverage vs expected demand over the review+lead horizon. No evidence of lost shipments currently. Therefore use the backend defaults: trust promised lead time (which matches observed), and let backend compute mu_hat and sigma_hat from all samples so ordering follows its capped base-stock policy. This balances service (use confirmed L=4) and holding cost by not inflating forecasts manually.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24 (Period 20). Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods. Current inventory: on-hand=0 (end Period19), in-transit=776. Recent demand has spiked (Period19 demand=556) compared with prior periods, suggesting a short-term upward shift; I favor an EWMA demand forecast to react to this while smoothing noise. Use promised/default L=4 (confirmed by many conclude messages). Use EWMA_gamma=0.3 for mu_hat to weight recent high demand but not overreact. Keep sigma_hat default to let backend compute volatility from full history and scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances service (respond to recent surge) vs holding cost given substantial pipeline (776 units) already inbound covering multiple periods.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained actual lead time = 4 periods (evidence: numerous conclude messages showing ordered\u2192arrived with 4-period lag through Period19); Recent demand surge in Period19 (556 units) \u2014 treat as a potential regime shift and monitor subsequent periods.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/1 (Period 21). Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (many concluded arrivals match ordered\u2192arrived with 4-period lag). On-hand=0, in-transit=1243 (large pipeline). Recent demand spike in Period 19 (556) suggests a possible upward demand regime; recent five-period mean is elevated vs earlier history. To be responsive to the recent regime while honoring proven lead time, I use the promised/default lead time and set demand estimates using the most recent 5 periods to capture the surge. This balances service (higher mu_hat to avoid stockouts after a big recent demand) with holding cost (we keep sigma based on recent variability to avoid overstock cap blowouts).

Carry-over insight: Sustained actual lead time = 4 periods (evidence: conclude messages across Periods 5\u201320 show ordered\u2192arrived with 4-period lag); Recent demand surge in Period19 (556) \u2014 monitor for regime shift.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Context: Date 2019-07-08 (Period 22). On-hand=0, in-transit=1412. Actual lead time has been consistently 4 periods (many conclude messages showing ordered\u2192arrived with 4-period lag). Recent demand spike in Period 19 (556) suggests a potential upward regime; to protect service while avoiding excessive holding cost use a short recent-window demand estimate. Choice rationale: L kept as default (promised = 4) because concludes consistently confirm a 4-period lead time. mu_hat: use recent_N (N=5) to capture the recent demand regime including the Period 19 surge so the base-stock reflects elevated demand across the review+lead horizon. sigma_hat: default (uses full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L)) to avoid overfitting variance from a single spike. These settings increase order-up-to for short-term higher demand while relying on stable lead-time estimate to avoid under-ordering given large in-transit pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained actual lead time = 4 periods (evidence: conclude messages across Periods 5\u201321 show ordered\u2192arrived with a 4-period lag); Recent demand surge in Period 19 (556) indicating possible upward demand regime \u2014 monitor subsequent periods.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-15 (Period 23). Actual lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods in conclude messages through Period 22. On-hand=0, in-transit=1405 (large pipeline). Demand shows a recent upward shift around Period 19 (demand=556) with elevated demand in Periods 19\u201322 (556,261,201,341) suggesting a possible new higher-demand regime. To capture this regime while accounting for confirmed L=4 and elevated short-term volatility, I use the promised/default lead time and compute demand forecasts from the most recent 5 demand observations to bias mu_hat and sigma_hat toward the new regime. This keeps pipeline-aware ordering (given large in-transit) and raises target base-stock to reduce stockouts during the apparent upward shift.

Date 2019/7/22 (Period 24). Historical concludes show a consistent actual lead time of 4 periods (many arrivals with 4-period lag), and on-hand=0 with in-transit=1480. Demand has a recent upward shift beginning Period 19 (demand=556) and sustained high recent demands (Periods 19\u201323: 556,261,201,341,422). To capture the new regime I use a recent-N forecast for demand (last 5 periods) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the higher recent mean and variability. L set to default (promised lead time=4) because concluded messages repeatedly confirm a 4-period actual lead time. This balances service (covering elevated recent demand over the review+lead horizon) against holding cost by letting the OR engine compute base_stock from the updated mu/sigma over the (1+L) horizon while respecting its cap and profit/holding tradeoff.

Carry-over insight: Sustained actual lead time = 4 periods (evidence: conclude messages across Periods 5\u201323 show ordered\u2192arrived with a 4-period lag); Recent upward demand regime beginning Period 19 (demand=556) with elevated demands in Periods 19\u201323 (556,261,201,341,422).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29 (Period 25). Historical conclude messages consistently confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (many ordered\u2192arrived pairs with W=4). Recent demand regime shift beginning Period 19 (demands 556,261,201,341,422) indicates elevated demand; use a recent-window forecast to capture this shift. L: use 'calculate' to reflect observed average lead time = 4 (consistent and sustained). mu_hat: use 'recent_N' with N=5 to base (1+L)\xd7mean on the five most recent demand observations covering the new higher-demand regime. sigma_hat: use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture recent volatility from the same window. This combination lets the OR engine raise target base-stock for the higher-demand regime while keeping lead-time calibrated to observed shipments; it balances higher service levels (to avoid stockouts during the new regime) against holding cost by limiting the window to recent evidence. Current on-hand (487) + in-transit (1294) appears adequate, but parameters ensure replenishment aligns with the elevated demand pattern and confirmed 4-period arrival lag.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). On-hand=714, in-transit=934. Historical concludes consistently confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (many conclude messages from Periods 5\u201325 show ordered\u2192arrived with 4-period lag). Demand showed an upward regime beginning Period 19 (demand series: Period19=556,20=261,21=201,22=341,23=422) but the most recent five observed demands (Periods 21\u201325 = [201,341,422,135,133]) are more mixed. To balance service vs holding cost I keep L at the promised/default (actual lead time repeatedly confirmed =4) and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to make the forecast responsive to the latest demand regime while avoiding overreacting to the single large spike in Period19. This provides the OR engine a (1+L)-scaled mean/volatility focused on the most recent 5 periods, reducing stockouts if the higher recent average persists while limiting excess holding if demand falls back.

Carry-over insight: Sustained actual lead time = 4 periods (evidence: conclude messages across Periods 5\u201325 show ordered\u2192arrived with a 4-period lag); Possible upward demand regime beginning Period 19 (evidence: Period19=556 and elevated demands through Periods19\u201323), monitor subsequent periods for confirmation.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). On-hand=506, in-transit=803. Historical conclude messages show a sustained actual lead time = 4 periods (consistent across many periods). Demand elevated starting Period 19 (556) with higher demands through Periods 19\u201323, suggesting a possible upward regime. To capture the confirmed lead time, set L by calculation from observed lead times. To adapt the demand forecast to the recent higher regime, use a recent_N mean for mu_hat (N=5 covering the most recent elevated samples). Use recent_N for sigma_hat (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep the OR backend's base-stock responsive to the upward demand while accurately using observed lead-time data to avoid understocking given the 4-period lag.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019/8/19 (Period 28). On-hand=630, in-transit=625. Historical conclude messages consistently confirm actual lead time = 4 periods. Demand regime: elevated demand beginning Period 19 (556) with generally higher demands through Periods19\u201327; I detect a changepoint at Period 19 and use the recent regime (Periods19\u201327, length=9) to set demand forecast and volatility. Choose L=default to keep promised lead time (matches confirmed actual LT=4). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=9 (captures upward-shifted mean and higher variance from Period19 onward). These parameters let the OR engine raise the base stock to service the higher demand while reflecting increased variability to control stockouts versus holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Sustained actual lead time = 4 periods (evidence: conclude messages Period5 onward show ordered\u2192arrived with 4-period lag); Upward demand regime beginning Period 19 (evidence: Period19=556 and elevated demands across Periods19\u201327).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26 (Period 29). On-hand=966, in-transit=529. Historical conclues consistently confirm actual lead time = 4 periods. Demand shows an upward regime beginning Period 19 (d = 556) with elevated demands in Periods 19\u201328 (556,261,201,341,422,135,133,339,243,100; 10 samples). To capture the sustained LT=4 and the recent higher/volatile demand regime, set L to promised (default) and compute mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent regime samples. Using recent_N=10 for mu_hat captures the elevated mean across the last 10 demands; recent_N=10 for sigma_hat captures the current volatility. This increases replenishment to better cover (L+1) periods of shifted demand while letting the OR engine cap orders via its cap to limit overstock risk.

Carry-over insight: Sustained actual lead time = 4 periods (evidence: conclude messages across Periods 5\u201328 show ordered\u2192arrived with 4-period lag); Upward demand regime beginning Period 19 (evidence: Period19=556 and elevated demands in Periods19\u201328: 556,261,201,341,422,135,133,339,243,100).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/2 (Period 30). On-hand=842, in-transit=538. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (arrivals from Period5 onward match ordered\u2192arrived with 4-period lag). Demand pattern shows an upward regime beginning Period19 (large spike 556 in P19 and elevated demands in P19\u2013P29). To protect service while avoiding excess holding cost, keep L at the promised/default (4) and forecast demand using recent samples from the new regime. Therefore set L=default so backend uses promised lead time; set mu_hat via recent_N to capture the post\u2010P19 regime (N=11 covers Period19\u201329); set sigma_hat via recent_N with the same N=11 to reflect recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Sustained actual lead time = 4 periods (evidence: conclude messages Period5\u201329 show ordered\u2192arrived with 4-period lag); Upward demand regime beginning Period19 (demands P19\u2013P29 = 556,261,201,341,422,135,133,339,243,100,124).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/9 (Period 31). Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (arrivals from Periods 5\u201330 match a 4-period lag). Demand exhibited an upward regime beginning Period 19 (demand spike 556 in P19 and elevated values P19\u2013P29). Current inventory is high (on-hand 741, in-transit 595) so I'm not aggressively increasing forecast beyond recent realized demand but will anchor forecasts on the recent regime. Therefore: use promised/default lead time (promised=4) since concludes confirm L=4; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=11 to capture the post-P19 regime (11 most recent demand observations covers P19\u2013P29) so the OR engine's base-stock reflects the elevated recent mean and variability while the cap will limit excessive orders given current large pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Sustained actual lead time = 4 periods (evidence: conclude messages Periods 5\u201330 show ordered\u2192arrived with 4-period lag); Upward demand regime beginning Period19 (evidence: P19=556 and elevated demands P19\u2013P29).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-16 (Period 32). On-hand=853, in-transit=406. Historical conclude messages consistently confirm actual lead time = 4 periods. Demand shows a clear upward regime starting Period 19 (demand spike 556 in P19 followed by elevated demands through P31). To capture the recent regime I set lead time to the promised/default (4) and use recent_N=13 for demand forecasts (covers Period19\u201331) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the new higher mean and volatility. This balances service (avoid stockouts under the new regime) vs. holding cost by using a recent-sample-based base stock and variance estimate rather than the full-history average.

Carry-over insight: Sustained actual lead time = 4 periods (evidence: conclude messages Period5\u201331 show ordered\u2192arrived with 4-period lag); Upward demand regime beginning Period19 (evidence: P19=556 and elevated demands P19\u2013P31).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). History of conclude messages shows sustained actual lead time = 4 periods; recent demand regime shifted upward starting Period 19 (P19\u2013P32 elevated vs earlier). Current inventory (on-hand 999 + in-transit 115) is ample now but demand regime elevation warrants higher review+lead forecast. Set L to promised (default) because concluded history confirms 4-period lead. Use recent_N (N=14, Periods19\u201332) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-changepoint demand mean and volatility over the confirmed elevated regime. This increases service while avoiding overreaction to older low-demand samples.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-30 (Period 34). On-hand=316, in-transit=280. Historical conclude messages consistently confirm actual lead time = 4 periods. Recent demand shows an upward/changing regime beginning Period 19 with elevated and volatile demand (Periods 19\u201333). To respect confirmed lead time and the recent regime, use promised/default lead time and compute demand forecast and volatility from the most recent regime samples (Periods 19\u201333) so the OR engine orders against current elevated mean and observed variance. This balances higher service needs after the demand surge while keeping safety stock responsive to observed volatility; using recent_N prevents legacy low-demand periods from diluting the forecast. Pipeline + on-hand will be compared by the backend to target (1+L) coverage.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-07 (Period 35). On-hand=38, in-transit=782. Historical conclude messages consistently confirm actual lead time = 4 periods. Demand picked up beginning Period 19 (P19\u2013P34 = 556,261,201,341,422,135,133,339,243,100,124,101,77,194,692,335) indicating an elevated regime with higher mean and volatility since Period 19. I'll use the promised/default lead time and set demand forecasts using the recent regime (Period19\u2013Period34) to capture the new mean and increased variance so the OR engine raises base stock while accounting for observed volatility.

Carry-over insight: Sustained actual lead time = 4 periods (evidence: conclude messages Period5\u201334 show ordered\u2192arrived with 4-period lag); Upward demand regime beginning Period 19 (evidence: P19=556 and elevated demands P19\u2013P34).

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-10-14 (Period 36). On-hand=0, in-transit=1337. Historical conclude messages show a sustained actual lead time = 4 periods (consistent arrivals Period5\u201335), and there is an apparent upward demand regime beginning Period 19 (elevated demands P19\u2013P35). I set L to the promised/default (4) because concludes confirm a stable 4-period lead time. For demand I use a recent_N estimator to capture the post-Period-19 regime (choose N=17 to cover Period19\u201335) so mu_hat reflects the higher recent mean over the review+lead horizon. I also use recent_N (N=17) for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. These choices make the OR backend target a higher base stock appropriate for the sustained higher-demand regime while using the confirmed lead time to size pipeline coverage; this balances service (avoid stockouts given current zero on-hand and large in-transit) against holding cost by limiting the tail to recent observed volatility.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21 (Period 37). Demand history shows a clear upward regime beginning Period 19 (large spike P19=556 and elevated demands since); actual lead time has been consistently 4 periods in concluded messages. Current inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=1406 units. To capture the sustained LT=4 use observed-average; to capture the post-Period19 demand regime use recent samples (most recent regime length ~18 periods) so the backend forecasts cover review+lead period appropriately while limiting overstating volatility.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). On-hand=50, in-transit=1236. Historical conclude messages consistently confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple arrivals show ordered\u2192arrived with 4-period lag), and there was an upward demand regime beginning around Period 19. Given confirmed LT=4 and ample in-transit inventory, use the promised/default lead time so the OR engine applies L=4. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the full demand history; this leverages all available demand data while letting the OR engine cap orders appropriately against pipeline. This choice is conservative given high pipeline and confirmed stable lead time while allowing the backend to account for the recent higher-demand regime via the full-sample stats.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/04 (Period 39). History shows arrivals consistently matching a 4-period lag since Period5 \u2192 treat lead time as stable. Recent demand pattern indicates an upward regime beginning around Period 19 (large spike 556 in P19 and generally elevated demands P19\u2013P38). On-hand=494 + in-transit=680 gives strong coverage, but because lead time = 4 we must stock for (1+L) periods of demand. I set L to default (promised 4). For demand mean and volatility I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the post\u2010Period19 upward regime while limiting noise from older low-demand periods; this focuses mu_hat and sigma_hat on the recent elevated-demand regime and helps the OR engine size base stock to balance service level (avoid stockouts during higher demand) vs. holding cost given current high pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Sustained actual lead time = 4 periods (evidence: conclude messages Period5\u201338 show ordered\u2192arrived with 4-period lag); Upward demand regime beginning Period19 (evidence: P19=556 and elevated demands in P19\u2013P38).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). Historical conclude messages show a sustained actual lead time of 4 periods and an apparent upward demand regime beginning Period 19 (large spike P19=556 and elevated demand P19\u2013P39). On-hand=808 + in-transit=292=1100 units which provides substantial cover vs. current elevated demand. I keep L at the promised/default (4) because concludes consistently confirm a 4-period lead time. To capture the recent higher-demand regime I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=11 (captures the most recent regime while avoiding overfitting to a single spike). These choices bias the OR base-stock upward to preserve service during the sustained higher-demand period while sigma_hat recent_N increases safety stock to balance holding cost and stockouts.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). On-hand=539, in-transit=259. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (sustained across numerous periods). Demand shows a clear upward regime beginning Period 19 (large spike P19=556 and elevated demands through subsequent periods). To reflect the sustained lead time and recent higher demand regime, keep L at the promised/default (4) and base demand forecast and volatility on the most recent regime data. I choose recent_N with N=20 to capture the post-Period-19 regime while capping at 20 samples for stability. This increases the backend base-stock to protect service during the higher-demand regime while sigma_hat from the same recent window captures elevated variability; this balances service level (avoid stockouts) against holding cost given profit=2 and holding=1.

Carry-over insight: Sustained actual lead time = 4 periods (evidence: conclude messages Period5\u201340 show ordered\u2192arrived with 4-period lag); Upward demand regime beginning Period 19 (evidence: P19=556 and elevated demands P19\u2013P40).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019/11/25 (Period 42). Concluded history consistently shows actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple conclude messages P5\u2013P41 with ordered\u2192arrived lag=4). Demand regime shift beginning Period 19 (large spike P19=556 and generally elevated/variable demand across P19\u2013P41) \u2014 treat as sustained. To capture true lead time use observed average; to capture the recent higher-demand regime use a recent-window forecast. Selections: L=calculate to lock actual observed lead time (4) so pipeline coverage uses correct lag; mu_hat=recent_N with N=20 to forecast (1+L)-period demand using the last 20 demand samples from the confirmed elevated regime, improving responsiveness to the higher mean; sigma_hat=recent_N with N=20 to reflect recent volatility and ensure safety stock scales to recent variability. These choices balance service (account for sustained higher demand and correct lead time) against holding cost by focusing forecasts on the confirmed recent regime rather than dilute long-ago low-demand samples. Current on-hand=195 and in-transit=735 provide substantial pipeline cover, but parameters above ensure future orders align with recent demand and the 4-period lead time.

LLM Rationale:

Conclude history shows a sustained actual lead time = 4 periods and an upward demand regime beginning Period 19 (large spike P19=556 and elevated demands through recent periods). To protect service while avoiding excess holding, use promised lead time (default L=4) since concludes consistently show 4-period arrivals. For demand forecast I use a recent_N estimate over the most recent regime (capture the upward-shift since Period 19) with N=20 (regime length \u226520 capped at 20) so mu_hat reflects elevated recent mean across review+lead; similarly use recent_N N=20 for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. This increases target base-stock to meet higher demand while the OR engine's cap limits extreme orders, balancing service level and holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

Demand regime shifted up starting Period 19 (large spike 556 and elevated demands thereafter). To capture the recent upward regime I use recent_N with a long recent window (cap 20) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect post-changepoint behavior while L stays at the promised/observed value. This balances service (cover higher recent demand) vs holding cost by letting the OR engine compute safety stock from recent mean/volatility rather than dilute with older low-demand samples.

=== Period 45 Summary ===
464297007: ordered=101, arrived=480 units (ordered on Period 41, lead_time was 4 periods), starting on-hand inventory=480, demand=360, sold=360, ending on-hand inventory=120

Daily Reward (R_t): $600.00

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/23 (Period 46). On-hand=120, in-transit=850. Historical conclude messages consistently confirm actual lead time = 4 periods; many arrivals match a 4-period lag. Demand showed a clear upward regime beginning Period 19 (large spike at P19 and elevated demands thereafter). To respect the confirmed lead time and recent higher-demand regime, use the promised lead time and compute demand forecasts from the most recent regime window. Chosen methods: L=default to keep promised lead time (actual=4 has been stable); mu_hat=recent_N with N=20 to capture the sustained elevated demand since P19 (use last 20 demand samples to reflect current regime); sigma_hat=recent_N with N=20 to capture volatility in the same recent window. These settings steer the OR engine toward a higher base stock (covering L+1 periods of the elevated demand) while using recent volatility to size safety stock, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30 (Period 47). Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (orders from Periods 5\u201346 arrived with 4-period lag). Demand experienced an upward regime starting around Period 19 (large spike P19=556 and elevated demands P19\u2013P46), so we must keep replenishment responsive. Current on-hand=152 and in-transit=877 gives ample pipeline covering multiple periods under L=4. To keep OR engine aligned with promised lead time and validated arrivals, use default lead time (promised=4). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7sample mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from available demand history\u2014this leverages the full history (including the upward regime) while letting the OR engine apply its service-level math given profit/holding costs.
