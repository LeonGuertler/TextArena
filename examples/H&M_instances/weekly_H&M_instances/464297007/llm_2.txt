Demand regime: recent demand P43\u2013P46 = [266,380,360,358] \u2192 current elevated demand \u2248350 units/period. Lead time & arrivals: historical concludes show variable lead time (2\u20133 periods recently); multiple 3-period arrivals observed (P5\u2192P8, P6\u2192P9, P8\u2192P11, P42\u2192P45). Inventory & pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=1400 units (outstanding shipments). Planning: required coverage for (L+1) periods with L likely 2\u20133 implies needing ~1050\u20131400 units to cover next 3\u20134 periods at ~350/demand. In-transit=1400 therefore already sufficient to cover upcoming demand even under L=3. Holding cost is high ($1/unit/period) vs profit $4; avoid over-ordering and risking extra holding cost. Final action: place no new order this period to allow in-transit shipments to arrive and reveal actual lead times before adding more stock.",
