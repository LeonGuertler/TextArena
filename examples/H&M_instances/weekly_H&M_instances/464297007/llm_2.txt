Lead time & pipeline: supplier promised lead time = 4 periods; currently on-hand=0, in-transit=0, no concluded arrivals to infer a different lead time or lost orders.

{
  "rationale": "World/calendar: Date 2019-12-23 \u2014 Christmas week can sustain elevated apparel/lingerie demand. Demand regime: recent demands (Periods 41\u201345 = 348,311,266,380,360) average = 333 units/period -> sustained elevated demand versus earlier low regimes. Lead time & pipeline: concluded history consistently shows actual supplier lead_time = 4 periods; in-transit=1200 likely represents multiple outstanding 4-period shipments but arrival timing per-batch unknown. Inventory math & order logic: with L=4 you should cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Forecast 5-period demand \u2248 5 * 333 = 1665 units. Current supply (on-hand 140 + in-transit 1200) = 1340 < 1665, shortfall \u2248 325 units. Given profit $2 vs holding $1, be moderately conservative and order to cover shortfall plus a small safety buffer. Order 350 units to reduce risk of stockouts over the next 5 periods while limiting extra holding cost.",

{
  "rationale": "World/calendar: Date 2019-12-30 is just after peak holiday shopping; no major upcoming demand drops expected immediately (New Year may slightly reduce but Black Friday/Christmas spikes already observed). Demand regime: recent periods (41\u201346) show sustained elevated demand ~330 units/period (evidence: Periods 41\u201346 sold 348,311,266,380,360,358 -> rolling average \u2248330). Lead time & pipeline: supplier actual lead_time = 4 periods (confirmed repeatedly). Current inventory: on-hand=352, in-transit=980 => pipeline total=1332. Planning rule: order to cover (L+1)=5 periods of expected demand. Target coverage = 5 * 330 = 1650 units. Shortfall = 1650 - 1332 = 318 units. Holding vs profit: profit $2/unit, holding $1/unit/period \u2014 avoid large overstock. Final order rounds shortfall to nearest practical lot to restore 5-period cover while staying conservative against overstock and unreliable past pipeline.",
