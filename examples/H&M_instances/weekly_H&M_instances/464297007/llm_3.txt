Demand regime: no on-site history yet to indicate a new regime; assume baseline demand with a potential short Valentine spike that cannot be fulfilled by new orders because supplier promised lead_time = 4 periods. Lead-time & pipeline: promised lead time = 4 periods; no concluded arrivals exist yet to confirm actual lead time. On-hand = 0, in-transit = 0, so no coverage for current or near-term demand. Ordering logic: Decision must cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand because orders placed now will not arrive until Period 1+4 (and arrivals are only visible after). Using baseline forecast \u2248237 units/period \u2192 5-period coverage \u2248 1,185 units. Given high holding cost ($1/unit/period) vs profit ($2/unit), we avoid extra safety stock beyond the (L+1) coverage.

Demand regime: recent periods show elevated demand (Periods 39\u201344: 241,387,348,311,266,380) \u2014 ~322 mean but recent weeks 380 and 311\u2013387 indicate holiday bump; forecast ~350 units/period. Lead time & pipeline: confirmed actual lead_time = 4 (evidence in conclude messages); In-transit=1230 (from orders in P41=600 and P42=630) which will arrive during this period. Decision logic: need on-hand + in-transit + new_order to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand because demand for current period occurs after decision and next supplier arrival is in 4 periods. Required cover \u22485 * 350 = 1750 units. Current coverage = 0 on-hand + 1230 in-transit = 1230 \u2192 short \u2248 520 units.
