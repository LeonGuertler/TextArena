Supplier promised LT=0 but actual LT unknown; however no past concluded arrivals to indicate delays. Because LT=0 would allow same-period arrival (arrivals happen after order but before demand), placing an order now can satisfy Period 1 demand if supplier honors LT=0. If LT>0 we risk stockout, but with no evidence of delays we assume supplier will deliver this period. e) Inventory decision: balance service level vs holding cost ($1/unit/period) and profit $4/unit. To capture the expected Valentine uplift while limiting overstock, order to cover the adjusted forecast. Final order: 280 units (within 270\u2013285 target).",
