Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11 (post-holiday, no special events). No on-hand or in-transit inventory and no concluded arrivals to infer lead time. Historical demands = [148,175,160,233,308] (mean=204.8, std\u224868.33). Promised lead time is 0 and there is no evidence of delayed or lost shipments. Use promised lead time (default) and full-sample demand estimates to let the OR backend compute a stable base-stock given available history.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Promised lead time is 0 and the only concluded order (Period 1) had lead_time=0, so keep L as the promised default. Historical demand samples [148,175,160,233,308] have mean=204.8 and sample std\u224866.27; with L=0 use default formulas to let OR backend compute base-stock vs cap. This balances service (recent lost-sales in Period 1) with holding cost by relying on full-history demand estimates rather than short-window noise.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25, no special calendar events. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times: Period1=0, Period2=0 \u2192 lead time confirmed 0. Historical demands [148,175,160,233,308], mean=204.8, std\u224866.27. No overdue shipments. Use promised lead time (0) and default demand estimates to let OR backend compute base-stock with full sample stats; this balances service (high stock to meet recent high demands up to 308) vs holding cost.

Carry-over insight: lead_time=0 confirmed (arrived on Period1 and Period2); demand mean ~204.8, std ~66.3 based on five-sample history.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent concludes (Periods 1-3) confirm actual lead_time=0. Historical demand samples [148,175,160,233,308] give mean=204.8 and std\u224866.3. On-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so we need full cover for current period demand. Use default methods (promised lead time and full-sample demand stats) to let OR backend compute base-stock consistent with observed stable regime and zero lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $540.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent concluded periods show a clear upward shift in demand vs older samples: Periods 1\u20134 demands = [266,316,306,283], mean=292.75, population std\u224819.54. Lead time has been confirmed = 0 in concluded history. To avoid stockouts in the current higher-demand regime, set lead time to promised (default=0) and base forecasts on the most recent 4-period regime using recent_N (N=4). This raises mu_hat to the (1+L)*recent_mean and sigma_hat to sqrt(1+L)*recent_std, improving service while keeping holding cost in mind.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shifted up: recent 4-period mean=292.75 (Periods: 266,316,306,283); recent population std\u224819.54. Lead time regime remains 0 (confirmed).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. Recent demand regime up: last 4 demands (266,316,306,283) => mean 292.75, std ~19.54. Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history (Periods 1-5). On-hand=51, in-transit=0 so available stock is low vs. expected single-period demand (~293). I set L=default (promised 0) and use recent_N demand estimates (N=4) to capture the new, higher-demand regime; sigma uses recent_N (N=4) to reflect the lower observed variability. These parameters steer the OR backend to a higher base stock appropriate for the new demand level while keeping volatility tight to avoid excess holding cost.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/25. On-hand=32, in-transit=0. Recent concluded periods confirm actual lead time = 0. Demand has been elevated vs earlier regime; I use the most recent 6 demands (266,316,306,283,252,270) to capture the current level and variance. Set L to promised (default=0). Set mu_hat using recent_N (N=6) => (1+L)*mean_recent = 282.1667 to size the base-stock for current demand regime. Set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=6) => std_recent = 22.483 to reflect observed volatility. These parameters prioritize service (higher mean) while the moderate sigma avoids excessive safety stock given holding cost = $1/unit.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/1 (Period 8). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded demands (Periods1-7): [266,316,306,283,252,270,364] show a sustained higher-demand regime (recent mean ~293.9). Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history. I set L to the promised/default (0) consistent with confirmed concluded lead-time=0. For mu_hat I use the default (all-sample mean) = (1+L)*mean(demands)=293.857. For sigma_hat I use the default (all-sample std, sample-based) = 38.252 (scaled by sqrt(1+L)). These parameters let the OR engine compute a base-stock that reflects the recent elevated demand while keeping safety stock proportional to observed volatility; using L=0 avoids inflating pipeline coverage when no in-transit stock exists and lead time has been confirmed short.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Lead time remains confirmed at 0 (periods 1\u20138 arrivals all show lead_time=0). Recent demand has been elevated; using all 8 historical demands (266,316,306,283,252,270,364,372) gives mean=303.625 and population std\u224842.01. With L=0, set mu_hat=(1+L)*mean to cover current period demand and sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std. This balances higher recent demand (avoids stockouts) while keeping holding risk moderate given holding cost=$1 vs profit=$2 (q=0.667).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15. Historical concludes confirm lead_time=0 and a sustained upward demand regime since Period 5 (recent 4-period mean=292.75, std\u224819.54). On-hand=26, in-transit=0 so we must order to cover immediate demand this period plus target service. Set L to promised (0). Use recent_N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new higher-demand regime (periods with demands 266,316,306,283). This raises the base-stock and cap appropriately to prioritize service given profit > holding cost.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22. Concluded history shows lead_time=0 for all arrived orders -> keep L=0. Recent demand has stepped up in the most recent 4 periods (Periods 7-10: 364,372,271,310) so I use a recent_N demand estimate to capture the new regime. Set mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last 4) = 329.25 to target service for the elevated demand. Use sigma_hat = std(last 4) = 41.23 (population std) to reflect current volatility. These parameters raise the base-stock to meet higher demand while keeping holding risk tied to observed variance; L=0 keeps pipeline short since arrivals have been same-period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shifted up: recent 4-period mean=329.25 (Periods 7-10: 364,372,271,310); recent population std\u224841.23. Lead time regime remains 0 (confirmed by multiple conclude messages).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical demands (Periods 1-11): [266,316,306,283,252,270,364,372,271,310,564]. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded periods. Recent demand shows a large upward spike in Period 11 (564) above the prior elevated regime (~329). To be responsive but not overreactive, I use L="default" (promised 0). I set mu_hat with an EWMA (gamma=0.3) to weight the large recent spike while smoothing noise; EWMA forecast \u2248384.77 (mu_hat applies to review+lead period, here 1\xd7EWMA). For sigma_hat I use the population std of all samples (sqrt(1+L)*std) to capture observed volatility \u224884.24. These parameters raise the base-stock to improve service in the face of recent high demand while sigma captures increased uncertainty to keep safety stock sensible.

Carry-over insight: Recent large spike in Period 11 (d=564) lifted EWMA demand to ~384.8 (gamma=0.3); lead time remains 0 (confirmed).

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Lead time: recent 'conclude' messages (Periods 1-12) consistently show arrived=ordered with lead_time=0 \u2014 use promised/default L=0. Demand context: recent large spike (Period 11 demand=564) and strong subsequent demand (Period12=424) raise short-run demand; EWMA (gamma=0.3) is ~384.8 for next-period demand. On-hand=106, in-transit=0 so we need to replenish to meet elevated single-period demand while balancing holding cost. I set mu_hat explicitly to 384.8 (1+L period forecast) to reflect the EWMA-updated demand; sigma_hat set explicit to 120 to account for elevated volatility after the spike. These parameters push the OR base-stock up to improve service during the current high-demand regime while keeping holding risk moderate given holding cost=$1/unit.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Lead time remains 0 (all concluded orders show lead_time=0). On-hand=35, in-transit=0 \u2014 no arrivals expected this period. Recent demand is elevated: last 5 demands (Periods 11-15) = [564,424,304,431,442], mean=433.0, population std\u224882.42. To balance service vs holding cost (profit=2, holding=1 => high target fill rate), I set lead time using observed average (0) and forecast demand using recent_N=5 to capture the sustained high-demand regime; sigma uses recent_N=5 to reflect current volatility. These parameters raise the base-stock to cover the higher recent demand while keeping safety stock aligned to recent variability.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/3 (Period 17). Lead time has been repeatedly confirmed as 0 in concluded history. On-hand=38, in-transit=0 so no pipeline cover; recent demand remains elevated vs. early history. I set L=default (promised 0). For demand I use a recent_N estimate (N=5) to capture the current high-demand regime (Periods 12-16 demands: 424,304,431,442,435) giving mean=(424+304+431+442+435)/5=407.2 units for the (1+L) review+lead window. For volatility I use recent_N (N=5) population std \u224851.92 to reflect recent demand variability. These parameters raise the base-stock to satisfy current high demand while keeping holding risk visible to the OR backend.

Carry-over insight: New sustained demand regime: recent 5-period mean \u2248407.2 (Periods 12-16: 424,304,431,442,435); recent population std \u224851.92. Lead time remains 0 (confirmed).

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Lead time remains 0 (confirmed by consecutive conclude messages). Recent demand regime elevated with a large spike in Period 17 demand (640) \u2014 using the most recent 5 periods (Periods 13-17) best captures current demand. I set L to promised (0). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to reflect the new higher mean and increased volatility, providing the OR engine a higher base-stock to avoid stockouts while accounting for higher variability.

Carry-over insight: New sustained high-demand regime: recent 5-period mean \u2248450.4 (Periods 13-17: 304,431,442,435,640); recent population std \u2248107.8; lead_time=0 confirmed.

To cover the immediate elevated demand while avoiding excessive holding cost, set lead time to the promised/default (0) and forecast demand using the most recent 5-period regime. This uses recent_N to capture the current high mean (more relevant than the long-run mean) and recent volatility for safety sizing. Parameters aim to raise the base-stock to satisfy the high short-term demand while keeping holding cost sensitivity via the OR backend's q-based z*.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24 (Period 20). Historical concludes show consistent lead_time=0 across many periods and a sustained elevated demand regime (recent periods include several 400+ demands and a 640 spike). On-hand=75, in-transit=0. I use L='default' (promised 0, confirmed by concludes). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'default' (use all historical samples) so the OR engine's base-stock reflects the full elevated-demand history rather than overweighting short recent windows; this balances service (avoid stockouts given frequent large demands) vs holding cost by letting the OR engine compute the proper safety stock via q. Numerical estimates: mean demand across all 19 observed periods \u2248 374.105, population std \u2248 102.77. These feed (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Lead time continues to be 0 (many concluded arrivals). Recent demand remains in a high regime; using the most recent 5 periods (Periods 16-20 demands = 435, 640, 419, 439, 301) captures current elevated mean while reflecting recent volatility. Setting L=default (promised 0) keeps arrivals same-period. mu_hat uses recent_N=5 -> (1+L)*mean = 446.8 units to provision for this period's demand. sigma_hat uses recent_N=5 -> population std \u2248109.12 (scaled by sqrt(1+L)=1) to reflect observed variability. These parameters raise the base-stock to meet high demand while the OR backend's cap prevents extreme overshoot, balancing service level vs holding cost given holding cost=$1 and profit=$2.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-08). Lead time remains 0 (multiple concluded arrivals at L=0). On-hand=268, in-transit=0 \u2192 current inventory covers less than one expected period of demand. Use historical full-sample statistics to reflect the elevated, volatile demand regime visible since Period 11 while keeping lead-time at the confirmed 0. Selected parameters: L=default (promised 0) so OR uses (1+L)-horizon; mu_hat=default uses mean of all 21 observed demands = 364.333; sigma_hat=default uses population std of all 21 demands = 103.25. These choices tell the OR backend to target a base-stock around the long-run observed mean with volatility captured, balancing service (high profit relative to holding cost) against holding cost given on-hand shortfall and no pipeline.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/15 (Period 23). On-hand=146, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm actual lead_time=0 across many periods. Recent demand elevated but no new regime-change signal since Period 18 entry; use all available history to let OR engine compute base-stock from full-sample mean/variance. Choose L='default' (promised 0) because concludes consistently show 0. Choose mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' so the backend uses the full-sample mean (~358.14) and full-sample std (~104.22) (these reflect the sustained higher-demand regime) and therefore balances service level vs holding cost for lead_time=0 covering (L+1)=1 period of demand.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-22. Lead time has been consistently confirmed as 0 in concluded history. Recent demand has moderated from earlier spikes: last 5 demands (Periods 19-23) = [439,301,232,238,212], recent mean=284.4 and recent std\u224882.83. On-hand=168, in-transit=0 so we need to restock toward the (L+1)-period demand. I set L=default (promised 0). I set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current regime (value=(1+L)*mean_last5=284.4). I set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect current volatility (value\u224882.83). These parameters bias orders to cover one-period expected demand while accounting for observed variability, balancing service level vs holding cost given elevated but stabilized recent demand.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29 (Period 25). On-hand=118, in-transit=0. Historical concludes consistently confirm lead_time=0. Recent demand has settled lower than earlier spikes: last 5 demands (Periods 20-24) = [301,232,238,212,207], mean=238.0, pop std\u224833.6. I set L=default (promised 0) since concludes repeatedly confirm 0. I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current lower demand regime and reduce over-ordering after earlier high-volatility periods. mu_hat = (1+L)*recent_mean = 238.0 to align base-stock with recent demand; sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*recent_std \u224833.6 to reflect current variability. These parameters reduce holding cost risk while maintaining service given confirmed zero lead time and current demand levels.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Lead time has been consistently confirmed as 0 in concluded periods; demand through Period 25 shows a sustained elevated regime with 25-sample mean=338.08 and sample std\u2248112.19. No overdue or lost shipments in history (In-transit=0, recent concludes all arrivals). Use promised lead time (default) to keep model aligned with observed on-time deliveries. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat to 'default' so the OR backend computes base-stock from the full-sample demand mean and volatility (captures the sustained higher demand while avoiding overreacting to single spikes). This balances service (using full-sample mean to cover demand) against holding cost given current healthy on-hand (101) and zero in-transit.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=265, in-transit=0. Historical concludes (Periods 1-26) consistently confirm actual lead_time=0, so use promised/default L=0. Use default demand estimates across all samples: mean demand over Periods 1-26 = 329.0 -> mu_hat=(1+L)*mean=329.0. Sample std over Periods 1-26 \u2248119.0 -> sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std=119.0. These settings keep the OR engine anchored to the full-sample demand level (captures recent high-demand spikes) while relying on confirmed zero lead time so orders can arrive same period and avoid excess pipeline buildup given current on-hand inventory.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19 (Period 28). History shows repeated conclude messages with lead_time=0 (no evidence of lost/late shipments). Recent weeks have lower demand but full-history mean remains informative. I set L to the promised/default (0) because many concludes confirm same-period arrivals. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (all-sample statistics scaled by 1+L) so the OR backend sees the long-run demand mean (\u2248321) and volatility (\u2248123) when computing the base-stock and cap; this balances service (captures prior high-demand spikes) against holding cost given current on-hand=242 and zero in-transit.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-07 (Period 35). On-hand=38, in-transit=0. Lead time has been consistently confirmed as 0 in concludes. Recent history shows overall mean demand \u2248283.71 and population std \u2248132.5 across 34 observed periods. Pipeline is empty so on-hand covers only ~0.13 of average period demand \u2014 risk of stockout next period. I choose L="default" (promised lead time=0) because multiple conclude messages confirm actual L=0. I set mu_hat using "default" so the OR backend targets a base stock around the long-run mean demand (1+L)*mean = 283.71, balancing service level vs holding cost. I set sigma_hat using "default" (population std scaled by sqrt(1+L)=132.5) to reflect observed demand volatility; this yields an order signal that considers high demand variability while avoiding excessive carrying cost given holding cost=$1 and profit=$2.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-14 (Period 36). On-hand=245, in-transit=0. Recent demand has moved to a low regime: last 5 demands (Periods 31-35) = [141,135,147,106,85], mean=122.8, population std\u224823.57. Lead-time has been repeatedly confirmed at 0 in concluded history. I set L=default (promised 0) and use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the new low-demand regime so the OR engine sizes orders to avoid excess holding cost while preserving service.

Carry-over insight: New sustained low-demand regime confirmed: last 5-period mean=122.8 (Periods 31-35: 141,135,147,106,85); population std\u224823.57; lead_time=0 confirmed.

No evidence of lead-time change\u2014concludes confirm L=0 historically. To avoid excess holding given $1 holding vs $2 profit, use the recent 5-sample demand to reflect the low regime: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_recent5 = 111.4 units; sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std_recent5 = 25.69. Keeping promised L (default) keeps arrivals same-period and lets OR backend size orders to meet the reduced demand while limiting holding costs.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/10/28 (Period 38). Lead time has been confirmed = 0 across many concludes. Recent demand has fallen to a sustained low regime (recent 5 periods: 147,106,85,84,109). On-hand=52, in-transit=0; no overdue arrivals. To avoid excess holding cost while maintaining service, I set L to promised (0) and forecast demand using the recent 5-period regime.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/4 (Period 39). On-hand=40, in-transit=0. Recent demand has moved to a sustained low regime over the last few weeks (Periods 34-38: 106,85,84,109,78). Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history. To avoid excess holding cost given low recent demand, I forecast using the most recent short-term regime (last 5 periods). Selected L=default (promised 0). mu_hat set using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the new low-demand regime; sigma_hat set using recent_N (N=5) to capture current low volatility. These parameters reduce ordering to match current demand and limit ending inventory holding costs while maintaining service for the short-term observed demand.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). Recent observed demand has settled into the low-demand regime seen since Periods 35-39 (demands = [85,84,109,78,61], 5-period mean=83.4, pop std\u224815.42). Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history. I therefore use promised lead time (L=0). To target current low regime and avoid excess holding cost, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 samples (captures current mean/volatility). This yields a conservative base-stock reflecting the low recent demand while the small sigma keeps safety stock modest.

Many concluded messages confirm actual lead time = 0. No evidence of lost shipments. To avoid excess holding cost while maintaining service, I use the confirmed lead time=0 and a recent-5 estimate for demand and volatility to capture the current low-demand regime.

Demand history (Periods 1-41) mean=249.0, population std\u2248142.86. I set L to promised/default (0) because concludes confirm same-period arrivals. I use default demand estimates (mu_hat = (1+L)*mean of all samples = 249.0) and default volatility (sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std of all samples \u2248142.86). These conservative, history-based defaults ask the OR engine for a base-stock that balances higher service (covers observed high-demand spikes) while avoiding excessive holding given current low on-hand and zero pipeline.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/2 (Period 43). Recent demand has settled low: last 5 demands (Periods 38-42) = [78,61,69,67,109], mean=76.8, population std\u224817.0. Many conclude messages confirm lead_time=0. On-hand=195, in-transit=0 \u2014 inventory already covers multiple (L+1) periods at this low demand, so order quantity likely will be small or zero. Decisions: keep L as promised (0) since concludes consistently confirm same-period arrivals; set mu_hat using recent_N to capture the new low-demand regime (N=5); set sigma_hat from the same recent window to reflect lower volatility. This tightens base-stock and reduces excess holding given holding cost >0.

Carry-over insight: New sustained low-demand regime detected: Periods 38-42 mean=76.8, std\u224817.0; lead_time=0 confirmed.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/9 (Period 44). Recent concluded history shows consistent lead_time=0 across many periods and a sustained low-demand regime over the last 5 periods (Periods 39-43 demands = [61,69,67,109,61]; mean=73.4, std\u224818.09). On-hand=134, in-transit=0 \u2014 no overdue shipments. I set L to the promised/default (0) because concludes repeatedly confirm same-period arrivals.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/23 (Period 46). On-hand=18, in-transit=0. Lead time has been consistently confirmed as 0 across many conclude messages (no evidence of shipment loss). Recent demand has settled into a low-demand regime (Periods 41-45 demands = [67,109,61,55,64]; mean=71.2, pop std\u224819.32). I choose L='default' (promised lead time=0). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the current low-demand regime (keeps orders conservative to avoid holding cost while meeting expected weekly demand). These parameters provide the OR backend a short (L+1)-period demand forecast aligned with the recent low-demand regime and moderate volatility estimate.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/30. Recent demand has settled in a low regime (last five demands: 109,61,55,64,92; mean=76.2, std\u224820.76). Lead time has been consistently confirmed as 0 in conclude history (many periods). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish to cover the immediate (L+1) period demand. I use L="default" (promised=0). I set mu_hat using recent_N over the last 5 periods to capture the current low-demand regime (N=5 gives mu_hat=(1+L)*mean_last5=76.2). I set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect current low volatility (std_last5\u224820.76). This keeps the base-stock small to avoid holding cost while maintaining service for the observed low-demand regime and leveraging confirmed zero lead time.
