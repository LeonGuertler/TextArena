Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019-02-11). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no concluded arrivals to infer lead-time; historical demands: [148,175,160,233,308] (mild upward variability, last sample high but not yet a confirmed regime change). Promised lead time=4 periods and no evidence to override it. Use default lead time to keep model aligned with supplier promise and avoid overfitting to the single high demand point. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing a balanced base-stock that covers L+1 periods of demand while letting the backend cap limit orders.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 (2019-02-18). On-hand=0, in-transit=314; Period 1 order (314) showed arrived=0 in conclude (no concluded lead-time observations yet). Historical demands: [148,175,160,233,308]. Because there are no concluded lead-time observations to revise promised LT=4, I keep L=default (promised). I use mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This preserves service-level targeting from the backend while avoiding overreaction to a single unconfirmed missing arrival; if future concludes show lost shipments or a different LT, I will switch to a calculate/recent_N or explicit LT and adjust mu_hat accordingly.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). On-hand=0, in-transit=635 (orders 314+321). Historical concluded periods show no arrivals yet for orders placed in Periods 1\u20132, so no confirmed deviation from promised lead time (actual L unknown). Demand history: [148,175,160,233,308], mean=204.8\u2014no strong changepoint signal. To be conservative given outstanding pipeline and lack of confirmed late arrivals, use promised lead time and population-based demand estimates so the OR backend can size safety stock from full-sample stats while capping per its cap rule. Methods chosen: L=default (promised L=4), mu_hat=default ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples), sigma_hat=default (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples). This keeps orders cautious until arrivals confirm lead-time shifts or demand regime changes.

Carry-over insight: In-transit 635 units (orders from Periods 1\u20132) outstanding; no concluded arrivals yet \u2014 no confirmed lead-time change.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (2019-03-04). Historical demands = [148,175,160,233,308], mean=204.8. On-hand=0, in-transit=980 (orders from Periods 1\u20133: 314+321+345); no concluded arrivals yet so no confirmed lead-time change vs promised L=4. Promised lead time (default) retained. Use default demand aggregation so backend computes mu_hat=(1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This keeps the OR engine's base-stock anchored to full review+lead demand while avoiding premature adjustments for unconfirmed late/lost shipments.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019/3/11). Historical demand mean = 204.8 (samples [148,175,160,233,308]). Four consecutive conclude messages show arrived=0 for orders placed in Periods 1\u20134 => shipments overdue vs promised L=4. In-transit = 1263 (> sum of past 5-period demand 1024) so no urgent replenishment, but persistent non-arrivals suggest actual lead time longer than promised; I therefore set L explicitly longer to force the OR engine to plan for a longer pipeline. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default (use full-sample (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std) because demand shows no clear regime change and defaults align with historical sample size. This combination increases planned pipeline coverage to mitigate lost/delayed shipments while avoiding overreacting to no-change demand.

Carry-over insight: Shipments for orders placed in Periods 1\u20134 have not concluded by Period 5 (arrived=0 repeatedly); treat actual lead time as likely >4 until conclude messages confirm otherwise.

=== Period 5 Summary ===
610776002: ordered=355, arrived=314 units (ordered on Period 1, lead_time was 4 periods), starting on-hand inventory=314, demand=252, sold=252, ending on-hand inventory=62
Daily Profit: $504.00, Daily Holding Cost: $62.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $442.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18): Recent conclude (Period 5) shows arrived=314 from order placed in Period 1 with lead_time=4, providing direct evidence that actual lead time = 4. On-hand=62, in-transit=1304 (pipeline large from recent orders). Use lead-time estimate based on observed concludes. Demand history mean=204.8; with L=4 the review+lead horizon is (1+L)=5 periods, so default backlog-based mu_hat and default sigma_hat are appropriate to let the OR backend compute base_stock while capping orders via its cap rule. This balances service (use observed L and full-sample mean) against holding cost given substantial pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods based on Period 5 conclude: 'arrived=314 units (ordered on Period 1, lead_time was 4 periods)'.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). Recent concluded arrivals show orders from Periods 1\u20132 had lead_time=4 (Period5 and Period6 conclude), so actual lead time aligns with 4. On-hand=113, in-transit=983. I choose L by calculating the average of observed lead times to reflect confirmed 4-period lead time. Use default demand and volatility estimates so the OR engine uses the full sample mean/std scaled by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L) respectively; this balances service level (profit > holding cost) using the backend base-stock formula without overfitting to short-term noise. No new carry-over insight beyond confirmed lead_time=4.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). Recent demand has risen and become more variable (last 5 demands: 306, 283, 252, 270, 364; mean=295). On-hand=94, in-transit=836 \u2192 pipeline=930, which is below (1+L)\xd7recent mean (5\xd7295\u22481475), so replenish posture should target the recent regime. Actual lead time confirmed = 4 periods in Period 6 conclude, so use promised/default L. Set mu_hat to recent_N (N=5) to anchor the base-stock to the most recent demand regime; set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices help the OR backend increase service level to meet elevated recent demand while using recent volatility to temper safety stock.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). Demand history shows recent high weekly demand [148,175,160,233,308] seed; concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 (orders from Periods 1\u20134 each arrived with lead_time=4). On-hand=5, in-transit=920 (large pipeline). Use calculated L to reflect observed lead times; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample, keeping safety from variability while respecting confirmed L=4 and large pipeline to avoid over-ordering.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods based on conclude messages: Period 5 arrived 314 units (ordered Period 1, lead_time 4); Period 6 arrived (ordered Period 2, lead_time 4); Period 7 arrived (ordered Period 3, lead_time 4); Period 8 arrived (ordered Period 4, lead_time 4).

Daily Reward (R_t): $453.00

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019/4/15). Recent concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (confirmed for orders from Periods 1\u20135+). Demand has stepped up since Period 5 (recent demands: 252,270,364,372,271); I therefore set L based on observed lead times and use a recent-window forecast (N=5) to capture the higher current mean and volatility. This balances service (covering review+lead demand) against holding cost by sizing base-stock from the recent demand regime while trusting confirmed lead-time observations.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained actual lead time = 4 periods based on conclude messages for orders from Periods 1\u20138 (evidence: multiple 'lead_time was 4 periods' conclude entries); Demand regime shift upward beginning Period 5 (recent mean ~305 over last 5 periods).

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22): on-hand=0, in-transit=1350. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (consistent arrivals for orders placed Periods 1\u20138). Demand regime shifted up starting Period 5; recent 5-period demand average \u2248305 used to capture new higher-demand regime. To maintain service with promised L=4 and large pipeline, set L to default (use promised lead time). Set mu_hat to recent_N (N=5) to base (1+L)\xd7mean on the most recent high-demand regime. Set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=5) to capture recent demand volatility. This balances higher target base stock for service against holding cost given large in-transit inventory and confirmed lead time.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29): confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods from concluded messages. On-hand=0, in-transit=1437 (covers multiple future periods). Demand increased starting Period 5; recent demand is elevated. Set L to default (promised=4) to align OR engine with promised lead time. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new higher-demand regime (focus on most recent 5 periods where demand is elevated) so the base-stock policy raises target inventory while keeping volatility reflective of recent variability.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019/5/6 (Period 13). Actual lead time has been confirmed as 4 periods repeatedly in concluded history (orders from Periods 1\u20138 concluded with lead_time=4). Demand increased starting Period 5; recent demand volatility and higher mean are evident in the most recent concluded periods (Periods 8\u201312). To respect the confirmed lead time and capture the recent higher-demand regime, set L to promised (default). Use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes base_stock from the most recent 5 demands (captures the post-shift regime and recent volatility). This balances higher service-level needs from elevated demand while letting the backend cap control order pacing given long lead time and holding cost.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/13 (Period 14). History shows confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple conclude messages Periods 5\u201313 showing 'lead_time was 4 periods'). Recent demand regime shifted upward beginning Period 5; last 5 observed demands (Periods 9\u201313) average \u2248305 and remain elevated. On-hand=80, in-transit=1668 (large pipeline). Use L=default to reflect promised lead time=4 and confirmed observations. Set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the new higher-demand regime ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 samples). Set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect volatility in the recent regime. These choices align the base-stock calculation to current demand level while the large pipeline reduces immediate ordering urgency.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained actual lead time = 4 periods (evidence: conclude messages for orders from Periods 1\u20139 show lead_time was 4); Demand regime shift upward beginning Period 5, recent mean \u2248305 over last 5 periods.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). Actual lead time has been confirmed as 4 periods across concluded messages. On-hand=50, in-transit=1509 (ample pipeline). Recent demand (Periods 10\u201314) is elevated: [310,564,424,304,431], mean \u2248406.6, indicating an upward demand regime vs earlier seed data. Use promised lead time (default) since actual = promised and concluded history is consistent. Set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the current high-demand regime for (1+L) review+lead demand. Set sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters focus the OR backend on meeting higher near-term demand while recognizing substantial pipeline inventory.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). Recent demand regime elevated since Period 5; last 5 demands = [424,304,431,442,?] (history shows higher recent demands; recent 5-period mean \u2248305). On-hand=0, in-transit=1801 \u2014 pipeline is large and covers multiple future periods given L\u22484. Lead time has been consistently observed =4 periods in concluded messages. To reflect the sustained higher-demand regime while grounding forecast in the most relevant recent data, set L to default (promised = 4). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the upward shift and avoid dilution by older low-demand samples. Use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices produce a base_stock tuned to the elevated recent mean while the large in-transit quantity reduces immediate ordering pressure and mitigates risk from possible lost shipments.

Recent demand regime elevated since Period 5; recent 5-period mean \u2248305 with high variance. To capture the sustained higher demand and current variability, set L to promised (default=4), and estimate demand and volatility from the most recent 5 observations (recent_N, N=5) so the OR backend sizes base stock and cap to the new regime while accounting for pipeline inventory.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Demand regime shifted up beginning Period 5 (recent mean \u2248305 over last 5 periods). To reflect confirmed lead time and use the OR engine's default demand statistics, I select L=default (use promised lead time = 4) and default demand estimates so backend computes mu_hat=(1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples). Given large pipeline (1952) and elevated recent demand, relying on defaults keeps ordering conservative while the OR engine's service-level formula (profit vs. holding cost) balances fill rate vs. inventory cost.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019/6/24 (Period 20). History shows repeated conclude messages confirming actual lead time = 4 periods for many orders (Periods 5\u201319 conclusions). Recent demand has risen materially; last 5 observed demands (Periods 15\u201319) = [442,435,640,419,439], mean=475. To capture the sustained lead-time regime and recent higher demand regime, keep L at the promised/default and set demand forecast and volatility using the most recent 5-period regime.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained actual lead time = 4 periods (evidence: conclude messages for orders from Periods 1\u201319 show lead_time was 4). Demand regime shift upward beginning Period 5 and persisting; recent 5-period mean demand \u2248475 (Periods 15\u201319).

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019/7/1). Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods and a sustained upward demand regime beginning Period 5; recent high demand persists (recent 5-period mean \u2248475 per prior insight). On-hand=290 and in-transit=1550 provides ample coverage vs. expected demand, so use promised lead time and focus forecasts on the recent high-demand regime. Set L to default (promised=4). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture the elevated recent mean and volatility, which helps the OR backend size base stock upward to protect service while avoiding excessive extra safety from older low-demand data.

Carry-over insight: Sustained actual lead time = 4 periods (confirmed by conclude messages through Period 20); Demand regime shifted upward beginning Period 5 and remains elevated (recent 5-period mean \u2248475 from Periods 15\u201319).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=331, in-transit=1789 (sufficient pipeline for multiple periods). Concluded messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22). Recent concludes confirm sustained actual lead time = 4 periods; promised = 4 so use default L. On-hand=530, in-transit=1202 (healthy pipeline). Recent demand has moderated vs earlier spikes; using recent 5-period demand captures current regime (Periods 19\u201323 demands \u2248 [301,232,238,212,?] with last observed sold values). Choose mu_hat recent_N N=5 to forecast (1+L)-period demand using most recent behavior and avoid overweighting early low samples. Choose sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility for service-level sizing. This balances service (avoid stockouts given long lead time) against holding cost given already-large pipeline.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019/7/29). Historical conclude messages confirm sustained actual lead time = 4 periods. Current inventory: on-hand=951, in-transit=574 \u2014 ample coverage vs recent demand. Recent realized demand (Periods 20\u201324): [301,232,238,212,207] \u2014 recent mean falling. To reflect confirmed L=4 and emphasize short-term recent demand, set L to default (promised=4), mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 (captures latest lower mean across last 5 periods), and sigma_hat default to let backend scale volatility across the (1+L) horizon. This avoids over-ordering given high on-hand and reduces holding cost while maintaining service.

Historical conclude messages consistently confirm actual lead time = 4 periods and a sustained demand regime shift upward beginning Period 5; recent 5-period mean demand \u2248475.

Current inventory: on-hand=991, in-transit=487 \u2014 healthy but demand remains elevated vs early samples. Use promised lead time (default=4) because conclude messages consistently confirm LT=4. Use default demand/volatility calculations so backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all samples; this balances service level (captures elevated mean) with holding cost by letting OR compute z* and cap.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). Recent realized demand has fallen from the previously elevated regime (~475) to much lower levels over the last 5 periods (Periods 25\u201329: 154,102,120,158,140; 5-period mean \u2248134.8). On-hand=851, in-transit=624 \u2014 ample pipeline. Actual lead time has been consistently 4 periods in concluded history; promised lead time=4. To avoid excess holding cost while maintaining service, set L to default (promised=4). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to adapt to the clear downward demand regime over the last 5 samples so the backend reduces target base stock accordingly.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shifted downward beginning ~Period 23; recent 5-period mean demand (Periods 25\u201329) \u2248134.8 (evidence: demands 154,102,120,158,140). Sustained actual lead time remains 4 periods (concluded messages through Period 29).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=1029, in-transit=301 \u2014 ample coverage vs. short-term demand but avoid excess holding. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history; use promised lead time. Therefore: L=default to keep alignment with observed promised lead time; mu_hat set using recent_N (N=5) to capture the new lower-demand regime; sigma_hat set using recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent demand volatility. This keeps base-stock responsive to the lower recent demand and reduces over-ordering while the pipeline clears.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). Recent demand has decreased since ~Period 23; latest 5-period mean (Periods 27\u201331) = 140.8 units. On-hand=888, in-transit=301; confirmed sustained actual lead time = 4 periods in history. I set L=default to use the promised lead time (4) consistent with concluded messages. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture the new lower-demand regime (most relevant for (1+L) forecast and volatility), so the OR backend will size base stock for the current lower mean and observed short-term variability while avoiding excess holding cost given high on-hand inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shifted downward beginning ~Period 23; recent 5-period mean \u2248140.8 (Periods 27\u201331: 120,158,140,145,141). Sustained actual lead time = 4 periods (concluded messages through Period 31).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/23 (Period 33). Observed sustained actual lead time = 4 periods (concluded messages through Period 32). Inventory is healthy: on-hand 917, in-transit 137. Recent demand has shifted downward since ~Period 23; recent 5-period mean demand (Periods 28\u201332) \u2248143.8. To match the confirmed L=4 and lower recent demand, set L to promised (default) and set demand forecast using the most recent 5 periods to capture the downward regime; estimate volatility from the same 5-period window. This keeps orders aligned with the current low-demand regime while the OR backend computes service-level safety stock using profit/holding cost.

Date 2019/10/14 (Period 36). Recent demand regime has shifted downward since ~Period 23; last 5 demands (Periods 31\u201335) = [141,135,147,106,85], recent mean = 122.8. Actual lead time has been consistently confirmed as 4 periods in conclude messages through Period 35. On-hand = 716, in-transit = 0; with sustained LT=4 we set base review+lead demand using the recent low-demand regime to avoid excess holding. Choices: L=default (use promised 4 since confirmed by conclues); mu_hat=recent_N with N=5 to reflect the recent downward regime; sigma_hat=default to let backend use full-sample volatility scaled for (1+L).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). Recent demand has stayed low since the downward regime (~Periods 23+); last 5 demands (Periods 32\u201336) = [135,147,106,85,84], recent 5-period mean \u2248111.4. On-hand=632 + in-transit=25 provides ample coverage versus (1+L)=5 periods of demand at the recent mean (5\xd7111.4\u2248557). Concluded history through Period 36 consistently shows actual lead time = 4; no overdue shipments outstanding. To capture the recent lower regime while using the confirmed lead time, set L to default (promised=4), use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to forecast (1+L)\xd7recent mean, and recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. This balances service (avoid stockouts) and holding cost by sizing orders to the recent lower demand level rather than older higher-demand history.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Confirmed sustained actual lead time = 4 periods in history; on-hand=523, in-transit=25 (healthy cover). Demand has been in a lower regime since ~Period 23; latest 5-period demand (Periods 33\u201337) average \u2248106.2. Use promised lead time (default) and short recent window (N=5) for demand mean and volatility so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the new lower-demand regime and avoid excess holding cost while preserving service.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shifted downward beginning ~Period 23; recent 5-period mean demand (Periods 33\u201337) \u2248106.2 (demands: 147,106,85,84,109). Sustained actual lead time = 4 periods (concluded messages through Period 37).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/4 (Period 39). On-hand=445, in-transit=33. Concluded history consistently shows actual lead time = 4 periods (orders from many periods concluded with lead_time=4). Demand regime shifted downward beginning ~Period 23; recent demand is much lower than earlier elevated regime. I choose L=default to use the promised lead time (which matches observed sustained actual lead time=4). For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the current low-demand regime (most relevant samples: Periods 34\u201338 demands = 106,85,84,109,78). Using recent_N for sigma_hat (N=5) keeps volatility estimates aligned with recent variability and prevents overstocking from older high-variance periods. These choices steer the OR backend to set a lower base-stock appropriate for the new low-demand regime while keeping lead time consistent with observed concludes.

Carry-over insight: Sustained actual lead time = 4 periods (confirmed through conclude messages through Period 38); Demand regime shifted downward beginning ~Period 23, recent 5-period demands (Periods 34\u201338) = [106,85,84,109,78], recent mean \u224892.4.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/11 (Period 40). Recent history shows a downward demand regime since ~Period 23; last 5 demands (Periods 35\u201339) = [85,84,109,78,61], recent mean \u224883.4. Actual lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded messages. Current on-hand 384 + in-transit 33 = 417 units, which roughly covers (1+L)=5 periods \xd7 recent mean (~417 \u2248 5\xd783.4). To avoid overstock given the clear downward demand shift, use a recent-5 demand estimate so the OR backend reduces target stock; keep L as promised (default) since concluded arrivals confirm 4-period lead time. Sigma uses recent-5 to reflect lower recent volatility.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). On-hand=340, in-transit=25. Concluded history consistently shows actual lead time = 4 periods; recent demand has fallen (last 5 demands Periods 36\u201340 = [84,109,78,61,69], mean\u224880.2). Use promised lead time to match observed stable lead-time regime. Set mu_hat using recent 5-period mean to capture the current low-demand regime and avoid overstock; set sigma_hat using recent 5-period volatility to reflect reduced variability. These choices keep base-stock conservative (lower safety stock) to balance profit vs. $1 holding cost given modest per-unit profit ($2).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019/11/25). Actual lead time has been consistently 4 periods (concluded arrivals through Period 41). Recent demand has been in a low regime since ~Period 23; most recent 5-period demands (Periods 37\u201341) = [109,78,61,69,67], mean \u224876.8. On-hand=273, in-transit=79; pipeline + on-hand adequate short-term but low recent demand warrants lowering forecast. Set L to default (promised lead time=4). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current low-demand regime and recent volatility so the OR backend reduces order targets accordingly.

Carry-over insight: Sustained actual lead time = 4 periods (confirmed through Period 41); Demand regime shifted downward beginning ~Period 23; recent 5-period mean demand \u224876.8 (Periods 37\u201341).

Concluded history consistently shows actual lead time = 4 periods; demand has been in a sustained lower regime since ~Period 23 with recent 5-period mean \u224876.8 (Periods 38\u201342). To match confirmed lead time and recent demand regime I set L by calculating the average observed lead time (will yield 4). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 periods to capture the current low-demand regime (N=5) so the OR backend targets an (L+1)-period forecast reflecting the reduced mean and volatility, avoiding excess holding cost while maintaining service given the confirmed L=4.

Recent demand has shifted down; last 5 demands (Periods 39\u201343) = [61,69,67,109,61], recent mean \u224873.4. On-hand 111 + in-transit 231 = 342 units, which is slightly below (1+L)\xd7recent_mean \u2248 367 implied by a 5-period cover. To avoid stockouts while reflecting the lower-demand regime, use promised lead time and short-window demand estimates (5 periods) for both mean and volatility so the OR engine targets service with lower inventory.

To align ordering with the current low-demand regime and confirmed lead time, use promised lead time (default) and estimate demand across review+lead using the most recent 5 observations. Use recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility rather than the long-run variance. This keeps base-stock and cap responsive to the downward demand shift while avoiding overstating uncertainty given stable concluded lead-time=4.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (Period 46). On-hand=63, in-transit=255. Concluded history confirms sustained actual lead time = 4 periods.

To avoid excess holding while preserving service, use promised lead time (default L=4) and base demand estimates on the most recent 5 periods to capture the current low-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Sustained actual lead time = 4 periods (confirmed through Period 45 concludes); Demand regime shifted downward beginning ~Period 23 and remains low (recent 5-period mean \u224871.2 for Periods 41\u201345).

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30 (Period 47). History shows sustained actual lead time = 4 (concluded arrivals through Period 46). Demand regime has been lower since ~Period 23; recent 5-period demands (Periods 42\u201346) = [109,61,55,64,92], mean \u224876.2. On-hand 22 + in-transit 263 = 285 units. With promised L=4, (1+L)=5; using a recent-5 estimate for mu_hat and sigma_hat captures the current low-demand regime and avoids overstocking given holding cost = $1 and profit = $2. Parameters chosen: L default (use promised 4); mu_hat recent_N N=5 to set (1+L)*mean based on most recent 5 demands; sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. This balances service (avoid stockouts) against holding cost given ample pipeline but reduced demand.

Carry-over insight: Sustained actual lead time = 4 periods confirmed through Period 46; Demand regime shifted downward beginning ~Period 23 and remains low \u2014 recent 5-period mean (Periods 42\u201346) \u224876.2.
