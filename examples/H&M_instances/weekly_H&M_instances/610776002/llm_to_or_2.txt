Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. SKU 610776002 has no on-hand or in-transit inventory and historical demands = [148,175,160,233,308] with no clear changepoint or seasonality in this short history. No concluded arrivals to infer actual lead time. Use promised lead time and population-based demand stats so the OR backend applies its standard base-stock calculation with full-sample mean/variance. This is conservative given zero inventory and avoids overfitting to short-term noise while allowing the backend cap to limit order size.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/2/18 (Period 2). On-hand=0, in-transit=314 from Period 1 order which concluded as arrived=0 (possible delay/loss). Historical demand samples = [148,175,160,233,308] with mean 204.8; recent observed demand in Period 1 was 266. Evidence is insufficient to declare a new lead-time regime, so use promised lead time and default demand estimates to let the OR engine compute base-stock while preserving safety against demand variability and potential delayed arrival.

Carry-over insight: Period 1 order=314 showed arrived=0 on Period 1 conclude \u2014 possible delayed or lost shipment; monitor for future concludes to confirm lead-time or loss.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). Recent demand samples = [148,175,160,233,308] (mean=204.8). On-hand=0, in-transit=635; two recent orders (Periods 1\u20132) concluded with arrived=0 \u2014 possible delay/loss but no concluded arrivals to compute actual lead time. Promised lead time is 4; because no concluded arrivals exist to infer a different regime, use default lead time and demand estimates so the OR backend uses full historical mean/variance across the (1+L) review+lead horizon. This balances service level (high unmet demand recently) and holding cost given limited evidence of persistent lead-time change.

Carry-over insight: Period 2: Period 1 order=314 showed arrived=0 on Period 1 conclude \u2014 possible delayed or lost shipment; monitor for future concludes to confirm lead-time or loss.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04 (Period 4). Recent realized demand has risen to ~266\u2013316 in the last 3 periods; on-hand=0, in-transit=980 (matches orders 314+321+345). No concluded arrivals yet so actual lead time is unobserved and current delayed arrivals are still within the promised 4-period window. Use promised lead time to avoid overreacting to in-transit but unconfirmed delays; set demand forecasting to emphasize the last 3 high-demand observations so orders respond to the recent upward regime while keeping volatility estimated from the same window.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. Recent realized demand is ~280\u2013320 units (Periods 1\u20134 demands: 266,316,306,283). All four recent orders (Periods 1\u20134) concluded with arrived=0, indicating probable lost shipments or a lead-time much longer than promised. Because concluded messages contain no successful arrivals, I cannot compute an observed lead time average; I therefore set L explicitly longer than promised to force the OR engine to hold more coverage. I base demand estimates on the most recent 4 periods to capture the current elevated demand level. Chosen methods: L=explicit to reflect suspected extended/lost lead time; mu_hat=recent_N (N=4) to target (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 4 demands; sigma_hat=recent_N (N=4) to reflect recent variability. These parameters increase target base-stock to improve service while acknowledging higher holding cost risk given uncertain inbound shipments.

Carry-over insight: Shipments ordered in Periods 1\u20134 all concluded with arrived=0 (Period 1 order=314 arrived=0; Period 2 order=321 arrived=0; Period 3 order=345 arrived=0; Period 4 order=340 arrived=0) \u2014 strong evidence of lost shipments or a materially extended lead-time; monitor for any future concludes to confirm.

Daily Reward (R_t): $442.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent demand has been high (Periods1-5 demand: 266,316,306,283,252) but Period 5 conclude shows Period1 order (314) arrived with lead_time=4, confirming promised lead time. On-hand=62, in-transit=1336 \u2014 pipeline is large vs. recent demand. Because concluded evidence matches promised lead time and there is a large pipeline, use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend applies its standard (1+L) scaling to all historical samples. This keeps service while avoiding unnecessary extra stock given heavy in-transit inventory.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (Period 5 conclude: arrived=314 units ordered on Period 1, lead_time was 4 periods); previous apparent lost shipments were delays rather than permanent losses.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). Historical demands show recent sample mean ~204.8 with five observations. Periods 1\u20134 shipments initially showed arrived=0 but Period 5\u20136 concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 (Period 1 arrived in Period 5, Period 2 arrived in Period 6) \u2014 delays not losses. Current inventory: on-hand=113, in-transit=1015 \u2192 pipeline+on-hand ~1128 units, which covers roughly (1+L)*mean demand (\u22481024) for L=4. I set L method to 'calculate' to use observed lead-times (confirmed 4). I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as 'default' so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this leverages full history and aligns target base-stock to observed demand while the confirmed L addresses prior delayed arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (Period 5 conclude: arrived=314 ordered on Period 1, lead_time=4; Period 6 conclude: arrived=321 ordered on Period 2, lead_time=4). Earlier apparent lost shipments were delays, not permanent losses.

Daily Reward (R_t): $634.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period=2019-04-01 (Period 8). Recent concluded history confirms actual lead time = 4 periods (several Period X conclude messages show lead_time=4). On-hand=94, in-transit=836 \u2014 pipeline ample vs. current demand but recent realized demand level is materially higher than the older 5-sample prior. Choose L by calculating average of observed lead times to reflect confirmed L=4. For demand forecast use recent_N with N=7 (use last 7 demand observations) to capture the new, higher-demand regime evident in Periods 1\u20137 concluded demands. Use recent_N for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These settings steer the OR backend to raise base-stock for the higher demand while using recent volatility for safety stock; using observed lead-time avoids underordering from prior lost/delayed shipment confusion.

Carry-over insight: Sustained regime shift: realized demand has increased vs. historical seed samples (recent 7-period average materially higher); confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple concluded orders show lead_time=4).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/8 (Period 9). Concluded history shows multiple arrived statements confirming actual lead time = 4 periods and a sustained upward demand regime (recent demands: 252,270,364,372 plus earlier high values 266,316,306,283). On-hand=62, in-transit=853 so pipeline is large but lead time confirmed; use promised/default L to match observed 4. To capture the newer higher-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=7 (uses the last 7 demand samples to compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This balances service (higher forecast for elevated demand) while the sigma estimate from recent data controls safety stock and holding cost given high pipeline and holding=$1/unit.

Daily Reward (R_t): $421.00

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019/4/15). Recent concluded history confirms actual lead time = 4 periods and demand has shifted up vs earlier seed samples. On-hand=121, in-transit=908 \u2014 pipeline is healthy but demand is elevated (recent demands: periods 3\u20139 = [306,283,252,270,364,372,271]; 7-period mean > historical seed). I set L=default to use the promised lead time (matches confirmed actual lead time). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=7 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (N=7 captures the last 7 concluded demand observations and is within the recommended bounds), so the OR engine will size base stock and caps using the elevated mean and volatility rather than older low-demand samples. This balances service (avoid stockouts given higher demand) against holding cost given sizable on-hand/pipeline.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). Recent realized demand has shifted higher (multiple periods with demand ~270\u2013372, recent 7-period average materially above earlier seed). On-hand=0, in-transit=1289 (pipeline large and aligned with confirmed actual lead_time=4). Use promised/default L to match confirmed observed lead time and avoid mismatch with OR engine. Use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new higher-demand regime (7 chosen to cover the most recent regime while respecting sample-size rules). These parameters steer the backend to a larger base_stock reflecting higher demand while letting sigma_hat reflect recent volatility, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=$2 and hold=$1.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained lead_time=4 periods (multiple concluded orders show lead_time=4); realized demand regime shift upward (recent 7-period average materially higher than earlier history).

Historical concludes confirm actual lead_time=4 periods and a sustained upward demand regime (recent periods 7\u201311 show much higher demand than earlier). To be consistent with confirmed promised lead time and let the OR engine recompute demand over review+lead using full history, use default lead time and default demand/volatility estimates so the backend applies its capped base-stock calculation with updated statistics.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained lead_time=4 periods (multiple concluded orders: Period5 arrival for P1, P2, P3, P4 arrivals all imply 4); realized demand regime shift upward (Periods 7\u201311 average >> earlier history).

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). Recent history confirms actual lead_time = 4 periods and a sustained upward shift in demand (Periods 7\u201312 show much higher realized demand than the seed samples). On-hand=0, in-transit=1175 (covers multiple future periods). I set L to default (promised lead time = 4) because concluded messages consistently show lead_time=4. For demand I use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new higher-demand regime observed over the last 7 periods; this biases base_stock upward to avoid stockouts given long lead time while sigma_hat recent_N captures current volatility for safety stock calculation.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=81, in-transit=1328. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple concluded orders with lead_time=4). Demand has shifted upward recently (periods 7\u201313 average materially above earlier history), so I use recent-sample estimates to reflect the new regime while keeping L at the promised/default = 4. Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=7) captures the higher mean and increased volatility in the last 7 periods; this plus large in-transit stock prevents stockouts while the OR backend computes base_stock and caps orders.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained lead_time=4 periods (multiple concluded orders: P5 arrival for P1, P6 arrival for P2, P7 arrival for P3, P8 arrival for P4, etc.); realized demand regime shifted upward (Periods 7\u201313 average >> earlier periods).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). On-hand=31, in-transit=1482. Historical conclude messages consistently confirm actual lead_time=4 periods and a sustained upward demand regime since Period 7 (recent demands much larger than early seed samples). Pipeline is large but arrivals are 4-period-lagged; maintain promised L and use recent data to capture the higher recent demand and volatility. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=7 to reflect the new higher-demand regime and to make base-stock responsive to the elevated mean and variance while avoiding overreacting to single spikes.

Carry-over insight: Sustained actual lead_time = 4 periods (confirmed by multiple concluded orders); realized demand regime shifted upward (Periods 7\u201313 average materially higher than earlier history).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/27 (Period 16). Multiple concluded orders reliably confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (arrivals from Periods 5\u201315 correspond to orders placed 4 periods earlier). Demand has shifted up vs. the seed samples: realized demands in Periods 7\u201315 are materially higher than earlier history, so I use a recent-window forecast. I keep L at the promised/default (4) because concluded history matches it. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=7 to capture the new higher-demand regime (Periods 9\u201315 approximately) so the OR backend raises the base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of the recent elevated demand while reflecting recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained lead_time = 4 periods (multiple concluded orders P5\u2013P15 show lead_time=4); realized demand regime shifted upward starting around Period 7\u20139 (Periods 7\u201315 average materially higher than Periods 1\u20136).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03 (Period 17). Multiple concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead_time = 4 periods (arrivals for orders placed in Periods 1\u201312 all reported with lead_time=4). Recent realized demand (Periods 7\u201316) is materially higher than earlier history, indicating an upward demand regime starting around Period 7. On-hand=0, in-transit=1925 (ample pipeline). I set L to default (use promised lead time = 4) consistent with confirmed observations. For demand forecasting I use recent_N (N=9) to capture the new higher-demand regime (covers recent periods while limiting noise). I apply recent_N for sigma_hat as well to reflect recent volatility. These parameters bias the base-stock toward the higher recent mean to avoid stockouts given long lead time, while sigma based on recent variance controls the safety-stock uplift to limit holding cost given large pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Sustained actual lead_time = 4 periods confirmed by multiple concluded orders (Periods 5\u201316 conclude messages). Realized demand regime shifted upward beginning ~Period 7 (Periods 7\u201316 average materially higher than Periods 1\u20136).

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/10 (Period 18). Multiple concluded orders consistently show actual lead_time = 4 periods; pipeline=1524, on-hand=0. Demand regime shifted upward beginning ~Period 7 (higher average demand in Periods 7\u201317). To respect supplier promise and confirmed reality, keep L as default (promised=4). Forecast (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) should use the recent high-demand regime: use recent_N with N=11 (Periods 7\u201317) to capture the elevated mean and variance for the review+lead period (1+L periods). This ensures base-stock reflects the new higher demand while sigma_hat uses the same recent window to estimate uncertainty; large in-transit stock reduces immediate shortage risk but we still size future orders to the new regime.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained actual lead_time = 4 periods (multiple concluded orders P5\u2013P17 show lead_time=4); realized demand regime shifted upward starting ~Period 7 (Periods 7\u201317 average materially higher than Periods 1\u20136).

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). Historical conclude messages show consistent actual lead_time = 4 (multiple concluded orders P5\u2013P18 indicate orders placed arrive after 4 periods). Demand has shifted up starting ~Period 7 (periods 7\u201318 average materially higher than Periods 1\u20136). On-hand=116, in-transit=1586 covers many periods but higher realized demand argues for using a demand estimate based on the recent high-demand regime. Set L to promised (default=4) since concluded lead-time confirmations match promise. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the recent high-demand regime (N=12, periods ~7\u201318) to capture the new mean/volatility and better balance service level vs holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Sustained actual lead_time = 4 periods confirmed by multiple conclude messages (periods 5\u201318); realized demand regime shifted upward beginning ~Period 7 (Periods 7\u201318 average materially higher than Periods 1\u20136).

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24 (Period 20). Historical concludes repeatedly confirm actual lead_time = 4 periods. Recent demand regime shifted up starting ~Period 7: mean demand Periods 7\u201319 = 416.54 vs Periods 1\u20136 = 282.17. On-hand=173, in-transit=1564 provides substantial pipeline cover, but higher realized demand requires basestock sized to the new regime. Set L to promised (4) consistent with confirmed actual lead time; compute mu_hat and sigma_hat from the recent high-demand regime to reflect increased mean and volatility (use last 13 periods, Periods 7\u201319) so the OR backend raises target base_stock and caps appropriately while avoiding understocks given long lead time.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained actual lead_time = 4 periods (multiple concluded orders P5\u2013P19). Realized demand regime shifted upward starting ~Period 7; Periods 7\u201319 mean demand = 416.54 vs Periods 1\u20136 mean = 282.17.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-01 (Period 21). Multiple conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 4 periods and a sustained upward demand regime beginning ~Period 7. On-hand=228, in-transit=1652 (pipeline ample). I set L to default (promised 4). For demand parameters I use recent_N over the post-changepoint regime (Periods ~7\u201319) to capture the higher mean and volatility; regime length \u224813 periods, so N=13. This focuses the forecast on the new, higher-demand regime while the pipeline already contains large receipts, avoiding over-ordering.

Carry-over insight: Sustained actual lead_time = 4 periods confirmed by multiple conclude messages (Periods 5\u201320). Realized demand regime shifted upward starting around Period 7 (use recent data Periods 7\u201319 for forecasting).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/8 (Period 22). Multiple concluded orders show actual lead_time=4 periods; demand regime shifted up starting around Period 7 (Periods 7\u201321 show substantially higher demand vs Periods 1\u20136). Current inventory: on-hand=133, in-transit=1796 (ample pipeline). I set L to default (promised 4) since concluded history confirms lead_time=4. For demand I use recent_N with N=15 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (Periods 7\u201321, regime_length=15) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7mean of the most recent regime. sigma_hat uses recent_N N=15 to reflect recent volatility. These settings align the base-stock calculation to the new higher-demand regime while recognizing the confirmed 4-period lead time and large pipeline to avoid over-ordering.

Carry-over insight: Sustained actual lead_time = 4 periods confirmed by multiple conclude messages (Periods 5\u201321). Realized demand regime shifted upward beginning ~Period 7 (use recent data Periods 7\u201321 for forecasting; Periods 7\u201319 mean ~416.54 vs Periods 1\u20136 mean ~282.17).

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-15. History shows actual lead_time=4 confirmed repeatedly and a sustained demand regime shift upward beginning ~Period 7; current on-hand=492, in-transit=1358 (total pipeline=1850) which covers multiple periods of elevated demand. I set L to default (promised 4) because concluded messages confirm actual lead_time=4. For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=15 to capture the post-changepoint high-demand regime (Periods ~7\u201321) so mu_hat reflects the elevated mean over the review+lead window. I use recent_N N=15 for sigma_hat as well so volatility is estimated from the same recent regime. These choices align the OR backend's base-stock toward higher service (higher \u03bc\u0302) while computing safety stock from recent volatility, and they avoid underordering given long, stable lead time and elevated demand.

Historical conclude messages consistently confirm actual lead_time=4 and a sustained upward demand regime beginning ~Period 7 (Periods 7\u201323 form the recent high-demand regime). Earlier apparent lost shipments were delays (multiple concluded orders show lead_time=4). Given confirmed promised lead_time and a clear recent demand shift, use promised lead time (default) and estimate demand and volatility from the recent regime to capture the higher mean and variability while avoiding stale low-demand bias.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29 (Period 25). Historical concludes consistently show actual lead_time = 4 periods and a sustained upward demand regime beginning ~Period 7. On-hand 991 + in-transit 796 = 1787 units; pipeline is substantial vs. recent demand but holding cost is material. To reflect confirmed lead time and recent higher demand, keep L at promised value and forecast using the recent regime (Periods 7\u201324). Chosen methods: L default (promised 4); mu_hat recent_N using the most recent regime samples to capture the upward shift; sigma_hat recent_N to reflect recent volatility. Using recent_N (N=18 covering Periods 7\u201324) aligns the (1+L) demand forecast and variability with the higher-demand regime, helping the OR backend set a base-stock that balances service level and holding cost given confirmed 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Sustained actual lead_time = 4 periods confirmed by multiple conclude messages (Periods 5\u201324); realized demand regime shifted upward starting ~Period 7 (use recent data Periods 7\u201324 for forecasting).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/5 (Period 26). Recent history shows confirmed actual lead_time = 4 periods (multiple concluded orders P5\u2013P25) and a sustained upward demand regime beginning ~Period 7. Current inventory: on-hand=1118, in-transit=679. Given confirmed LT=4, use the promised/default lead time. To capture the regime shift I use recent-history estimates for demand (covering the post-change regime). Choosing recent_N with N=19 (Periods 7\u201325) for mu_hat and sigma_hat ensures the OR backend computes demand across review+lead using the elevated recent mean and volatility, improving service while avoiding excess inventory. This also accounts for previously delayed shipments (not lost): using LT=default keeps model aligned with realized 4-period arrivals while recent_N demand prevents under-ordering during the higher-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Sustained actual lead_time = 4 periods confirmed by conclude messages P5\u2013P25; realized demand regime shifted upward starting ~Period 7 (use recent periods 7\u201325 for forecasting).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). Historical concludes show a sustained actual lead_time = 4 periods and a clear upward demand regime beginning ~Period 7. Current on-hand=1175 and in-transit=624 (pipeline) \u2014 ample cover but we must size future orders to the higher recent demand. Set L to promised (default) since concluded history confirms lead_time=4 and promised=4. For demand forecasting use recent_N over the new regime to capture elevated mean (regime length \u2248 Periods 7\u201326 \u2192 20 periods). Use recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect realized volatility in the same recent window. These choices align mu_hat and sigma_hat with the sustained higher-demand regime and the confirmed lead time, reducing stockouts while controlling holding given high on-hand.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/19 (Period 28). Strong evidence of sustained actual lead_time = 4 periods (multiple concluded orders P5\u2013P27). Demand regime shifted upward starting ~Period 7 (Periods 7\u201327 show materially higher demand vs Periods 1\u20136). On-hand=1258, in-transit=468; pipeline looks healthy versus current demand. I set L to promised/default (4) because concluded history confirms promised lead time. For forecasting I use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (use most recent 20 samples from the new regime to avoid dilution by early low-demand periods). This raises base-stock to match the higher demand while sigma_hat recent_N captures current volatility; together these parameters help the OR backend size orders to maintain service under confirmed 4-period lead time without overreacting to older low-demand data.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=1253 + in-transit=383 provides strong cover vs. recent demand. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead_time=4 (multiple concluded orders Periods 5\u201328). Demand regime shifted up starting ~Period 7; recent periods show materially higher demand than Periods 1\u20136. To reflect the sustained lead_time and elevated recent demand, use promised lead time (default) and base mu/sigma on the most recent regime (use recent_N with N=20 to capture Periods 9\u201328 behavior while capping at 20). This balances service level against holding cost given profit=2, holding=1 (z derived by backend).

Carry-over insight: Sustained actual lead_time = 4 periods confirmed by conclude messages (Periods 5\u201328); realized demand regime shifted upward beginning ~Period 7 (use recent periods for forecasting).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/2 (Period 30). On-hand=1277, in-transit=328. Historical conclude messages consistently confirm actual lead_time = 4 periods (multiple concluded orders P5\u2013P29). Realized demand regime shifted upward beginning ~Period 7 (Periods 7\u201329 show materially higher demand than Periods 1\u20136). To reflect confirmed lead time use 'calculate' (avg observed lead_time = 4). To capture the sustained higher-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=23 (Periods 7\u201329 inclusive) so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std; this balances service level against holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1 and avoids diluting the forecast with older, lower-demand samples. This also accounts for earlier apparent lost shipments (they were delays) because L is inferred from concluded orders.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/9 (Period 31). Historical conclude messages repeatedly confirm actual lead_time = 4 periods and a sustained upward demand regime beginning around Period 7 (recent demands much higher than Periods 1\u20136). To capture the recent higher-demand regime while matching the promised lead time, set L to default (promised 4). Use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility based on the most recent 20 demand observations (captures the regime shift and reduces influence of the low early-period samples). This balances service level (higher demand) against holding cost by sizing base-stock and cap from recent higher demand estimates.

Carry-over insight: Sustained actual lead_time = 4 periods confirmed by multiple concluded orders (Periods 5\u201330); realized demand regime shifted upward starting ~Period 7 (use recent periods for forecasting).

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16): multiple concluded orders across Periods 5\u201331 confirm actual lead_time = 4 periods and a sustained upward demand regime beginning around Period 7. Recent demand (Periods 25\u201331) averages ~137 units/week, well below earlier spike periods but materially higher than initial seed sample means; current on-hand (1142) + in-transit (397) = 1539 units comfortably covers (1+L)\xd7recent demand. Choose L=default to use the promised lead time (confirmed as 4). Use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor forecasting to the post-changepoint regime (recent 7-period window captures current demand level and volatility). This reduces the risk of underordering from the shifted regime while avoiding overreaction to older low-demand data.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/23 (Period 33). History shows multiple concluded orders with lead_time=4 and no persistent lost shipments; on-hand=1075, in-transit=329. Demand regime shifted upward starting ~Period 7 (use recent data). Set L to promised (4) since concluded messages confirm actual=4. Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-changepoint higher mean/volatility; choose N=26 to cover Periods 7\u201332 (regime length ~26). This keeps the base-stock tuned to the sustained higher demand while the OR backend will compute safety stock from these estimates.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/30 (Period 34). Historical conclude messages strongly confirm actual lead_time = 4 periods and a sustained upward demand regime beginning ~Period 7. On-hand=1037, in-transit=439. To capture the post-changepoint regime I use recent-window estimates capped by policy guidance. L: use promised/default (4). mu_hat: use recent_N with N=20 to base (1+L)\xd7mean on the latest ~20 periods reflecting the higher-demand regime. sigma_hat: use recent_N with N=20 to capture realized volatility in the same recent window. These choices align pipeline coverage for (L+1) periods while reacting to the sustained demand increase and confirmed lead-time (avoids underordering for the higher demand and avoids excess safety stock by using recent variability).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019/10/7 (Period 35). Historical concludes show a sustained actual lead_time = 4 periods and a clear upward demand regime shift beginning ~Period 7. On-hand=1048 and in-transit=322 give strong coverage short-term. Set L to promised/default (confirmed = 4). For demand I use recent data to reflect the sustained higher regime: use recent_N with N=20 (last 20 demand observations within the high-demand regime) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility based on the most relevant samples. This balances service (higher recent mean) against holding cost given large on-hand; using recent_N reduces bias from early low-demand periods.

Carry-over insight: Sustained actual lead_time = 4 periods confirmed by many conclude messages (Periods 5\u201334); realized demand regime shifted upward beginning ~Period 7 (use recent periods for forecasting).

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/10/14 (Period 36). Multiple conclude messages across history confirm actual lead_time=4 periods and a sustained upward demand regime beginning around Period 7. On-hand=1066, in-transit=223 -> healthy pipeline but recent demand higher than early history, so forecast should use recent data. Set L to default (promised 4). Use recent_N for mu_hat to capture the upward regime (N=20 to cover the most recent stable window while respecting the N cap). Use recent_N for sigma_hat with N=20 to reflect recent volatility rather than older low-demand periods. These choices align the OR base-stock computation with the verified lead time and recent higher demand, balancing service level and holding costs given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21. History shows sustained actual lead_time = 4 periods (multiple concluded orders). Demand regime shifted upward beginning ~Period 7; recent periods show materially higher demand than Periods 1\u20136. On-hand=982 + in-transit=223 provides healthy coverage now, but we must forecast using the higher recent demand regime. Set L to promised (default=4). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=20 to capture the post-changepoint regime while capping sensitivity to very short-term noise; this biases orders toward meeting higher recent mean demand and accounts for recent volatility so the OR backend can compute a higher base-stock and appropriate safety stock.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). Historical conclude messages consistently confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple concluded orders P5\u2013P37).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/04 Period 39. Historical conclude messages consistently confirm actual lead_time = 4 periods (many concluded orders with lead_time=4). Demand regime shifted upward beginning ~Period 7 vs Periods 1\u20136. On-hand=1014, in-transit=368 so pipeline is healthy. Choose L=default to use the promised lead time (promised=4, confirmed by concludes). Use mu_hat recent_N with N=7 to focus forecast on the post-changepoint higher-demand regime. Use sigma_hat default to rely on longer-run volatility scaling (conservative for service vs holding tradeoff). These settings ensure the OR backend targets a base stock tuned to the higher recent demand while respecting the observed 4-period lead time and avoiding excess volatility-driven orders.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/11 (Period 40). On-hand=957, in-transit=364. Historical concludes consistently confirm actual lead time = 4 periods and a sustained upward demand regime beginning ~Period 7 (Periods 7\u201339 average materially above Periods 1\u20136). To reflect confirmed L=4 and the recent higher-demand regime, use recent_N estimates over a recent window to capture the new mean and volatility while the OR engine still assumes promised lead time. This balances service (avoid stockouts given high demand) against holding cost because the recent-window mean raises the base-stock but using a finite N limits overweighting older extremes.

Carry-over insight: Sustained actual lead_time = 4 periods confirmed by many conclude messages (Periods 5\u201339); realized demand regime shifted upward beginning ~Period 7 (use recent periods for forecasting).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/18 (Period 41). History shows sustained actual lead_time = 4 periods (many concluded orders). Recent realized demand regime is materially higher than the initial seed samples (sustained shift beginning ~Period 7). I therefore keep promised lead time (default) and use a recent-N demand estimate to capture the upward regime; keep default volatility scaling so OR backend uses full-sample std scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances service (capture higher recent demand) vs holding cost by relying on recent mean for sizing.

Carry-over insight: Sustained actual lead_time = 4 periods confirmed by many conclude messages (Periods 5\u201340). Realized demand regime shifted upward beginning ~Period 7 (use recent periods for forecasting).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/25 (Period 42). History of conclude messages confirms sustained actual lead time = 4 periods and a clear upward demand regime beginning around Period 7. Current inventory: on-hand=821, in-transit=364. Use promised/default lead time (4) since actual=4 is confirmed. Forecast (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) should be driven by the recent high-demand regime; use recent_N with N=20 to capture the most recent 20 periods (covers the sustained higher-demand window) so the OR engine sets a base-stock aligned to the elevated demand while sigma_hat recent_N captures recent variability. This balances service (high profit vs stockouts) against holding cost given current healthy on-hand position and pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Sustained actual lead_time = 4 periods confirmed by many conclude messages (Periods 5\u201341). Realized demand regime shifted upward starting ~Period 7; use recent periods for forecasting (evidence: Periods 7\u201341 average materially higher than Periods 1\u20136).

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/9 (Period 44). On-hand=1015, in-transit=0. History shows multiple concluded orders with consistent lead_time=4 (Periods 5\u201343 conclude messages). Demand regime shifted up starting around Period 7 (recent periods materially higher than Periods 1\u20136). Given confirmed actual lead_time=4 and a persistent higher-demand regime, keep promised lead time (default) for L so OR uses promised value, and base demand estimates on recent data to capture the new regime. I select recent_N with N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the most recent, higher-demand regime while respecting the N selection rule (cap at 20). This balances service (avoid stockouts under higher demand) versus holding cost given a large on-hand position.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/16 (Period 45). Multiple concluded orders across history consistently show actual lead_time = 4 periods. Demand regime increased beginning around Period 7 (Periods 7\u201344 average materially above Periods 1\u20136). On-hand is high (960) and in-transit=0; still use confirmed lead_time=4. Set L to promised/default (4). For forecasting, use recent_N=20 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime while capping N at 20. Apply same recent_N=20 for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These choices focus the base-stock on the newer higher-demand regime and avoid understating demand given the long, confirmed lead-time.

Carry-over insight: Sustained actual lead_time = 4 periods confirmed by many concluded orders (evidence: concluded arrivals for orders placed in Periods 1\u201341 showing lead_time=4); realized demand regime shifted upward starting ~Period 7 (use recent periods for forecasting).

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/23 (Period 46). Historical concludes confirm sustained actual lead_time = 4 periods and a regime shift to higher realized demand beginning ~Period 7. Current on-hand=896, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample cover vs. short-term demand so avoid new aggressive replenishment. I therefore use the promised/default lead time (4) and let the OR engine compute mu_hat and sigma_hat from full-sample defaults so orders reflect the long-run mean scaled by (1+L), keeping ordering conservative given high on-hand and confirmed lead time.

Carry-over insight: Sustained actual lead_time = 4 periods confirmed by many concluded orders (Periods 5\u201345); realized demand regime shifted upward beginning ~Period 7 (use recent periods for forecasting; Periods 7\u201319 mean materially higher than Periods 1\u20136).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-620.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30 (Period 47). On-hand=804, in-transit=392. Historical conclude messages consistently confirm actual lead_time=4 periods and a sustained upward demand regime beginning ~Period 7 (recent periods demand >> Periods 1\u20136). Many concluded orders show lead_time=4, so use promised/default lead time. To capture the upward demand shift I use recent_N forecasting (focus on most recent regime). Selected N=20 (regime length >>20 so cap at 20) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to estimate (1+L)-period demand mean and volatility from the recent high-demand regime. This balances service level (avoid stockouts given long L=4 and higher recent demand) against holding cost by using recent samples instead of all-time mean. Monitoring: watch for any future missing concludes (would indicate lost shipments) and re-evaluate if conclude pattern changes.

Carry-over insight: sustained actual lead_time = 4 periods confirmed by concluded orders (Periods 5\u201346); realized demand regime shifted upward starting ~Period 7 (use recent periods for forecasting).
