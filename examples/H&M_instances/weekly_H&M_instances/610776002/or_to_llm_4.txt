Step 3 \u2014 OR recommendation: OR suggests 0 units because it uses promised lead time and historical sample; given the very large pipeline and high holding cost relative to profit (holding $1 vs profit $4), placing an order now would increase holding costs and risk overstock if demand cools. Step 4 \u2014 Decision: Place 0 units.

Recent sustained demand regime (Periods 35\u201341) avg \u224879 units/period; recent weeks (P43\u201346) show small noise, not a sustained shift.

Decision rationale vs OR: OR recommended 460 (uses outdated higher-demand history and promised lead time); given confirmed L=4 and the lower recent demand regime, I place a much smaller replenishment to bring pipeline up to target base stock while avoiding excess holding cost. Final action: order 92 units to cover expected 5-period demand plus safety stock consistent with observed lower-demand regime.",
