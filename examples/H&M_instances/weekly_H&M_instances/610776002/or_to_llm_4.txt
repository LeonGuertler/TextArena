Historical sample mean=204.8, sd\u224865.3. OR recommends 345 units (baseline capped policy using promised L and full history).\nDemand & lead-time reasoning: Recent realized demand in the last two concluded periods is 266 and 316 (avg=291), materially above the long-run mean 204.8, suggesting a demand uptick. Because arrivals placed now will only arrive after the true lead time (promised L=4), we must cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand starting now. Expected 5-period demand using recent higher short-run mean (~291) would be ~1455 units; pipeline+on-hand currently cover only 635, leaving a large shortfall. Using the conservative approach between OR cap and observed recent demand, I increase replenishment above OR to reduce future stockouts given high recent demand and long lead time.\nFinal decision: Order 400 units for 610776002. This is above the OR recommendation (345) to partially close the larger-than-expected pipeline shortfall driven by recent high demand, while remaining cautious of holding cost (holding=$1/unit/period) by not matching the full five-period recent mean (~1455).
