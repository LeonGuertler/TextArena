OR computed a capped order \u2248314 using its base-stock/cap method. Lead-time inference: No concluded arrivals yet, so actual lead time is unknown; cannot assume faster arrival. Risk assessment: With L=2 we must cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand after ordering because arrivals occur after the decision and demand is realized each period. Expected demand over 3 periods \u03bc\u0302 = 3\xd7204.8 \u2248 614.4 units. Inventory target: To avoid stockouts given zero pipeline and no confirmed shorter lead time, order should aim to cover the 3-period expected demand. Tradeoffs: Holding cost is $1/unit/period vs profit $2/unit; critical fractile moderate, but the operational constraint (zero pipeline, arrivals delayed) makes stocking to expected 3-period demand prudent to prevent lost sales in early periods. Decision: Increase OR's recommendation to cover expected 3-period demand \u2248615 units.

{
  "rationale": "Inventory & pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=1104. Prior concluded evidence indicates one lost shipment ~112 units (Period 3) so deliverable pipeline \u22481104\u2212112=~992. Lead time has been variable (observed 1\u20133) but most recent concluded arrivals don't require increasing orders now. Demand outlook: recent sustained low demand (Periods 36\u201346 average \u224877\u201392 units/period). Cost tradeoff: profit=$2, holding=$1 \u2192 carry cost is high relative to per-period demand; unnecessary ordering increases holding cost. OR recommends 0 (uses promised L and long-run history). Given large confirmed pipeline that covers many periods of current low demand (~992 deliverable units \u226b typical period demand ~80\u201390), I place no order to avoid holding costs and potential overstocks.
