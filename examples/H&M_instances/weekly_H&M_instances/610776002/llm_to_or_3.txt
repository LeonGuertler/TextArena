Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. SKU 610776002 has past demands [148,175,160,233,308]; on-hand=0, in-transit=0, promised lead time=4. No concluded arrivals or lead-time evidence yet. Use default lead time and demand-statistics to let the OR backend compute base-stock from full-sample mean/variance. This is conservative given zero inventory and no in-transit units: default (1+L)\xd7mean will raise target inventory to cover current + lead periods while sigma from full history captures observed variability, balancing service level (profit-driven fill) against holding cost.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). On-hand=0, in-transit=314 (order placed Period 1 showed arrived=0 in Period 1 conclude). No concluded arrivals with lead-time info exist yet, so cannot infer actual lead time or lost shipment. Historical demand samples = [148,175,160,233,308], mean=204.8. Use promised lead time (no observed lead-time data) and default demand/volatility estimators so the OR backend applies (1+L) scaling to the full-sample mean and std. This keeps the policy conservative given zero on-hand and a large in-transit quantity while avoiding premature manual overrides for lead time.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/2/25 (Period 3). Recent observed demands = [148,175,160,233,308] (mean ~205). On-hand=0, in-transit=635. Promised lead time is 4 and no concluded arrivals yet \u2014 but orders placed in Periods 1\u20132 would not be scheduled to arrive until later given promised L=4, so absence of arrivals is expected; insufficient evidence to infer a longer actual lead time or lost shipments. Use default lead time to let OR backend assume promised L=4 and compute mu_hat and sigma_hat from full sample ((1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std). This balances service level (captures observed demand mean across review+lead) versus holding cost; keeping defaults avoids overreacting to missing concludes.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Promised lead time is 4 periods and no concluded arrivals have been observed yet (orders from Periods 1\u20133 remain in-transit = 980), so cannot infer a shorter/longer actual lead time. Recent realized demands (Periods 1\u20133 conclude) are high but within expected variability; use conservative default forecasting so OR backend uses full historical sample mean/variance. Set L to default (promised=4) so pipeline coverage (1+L) is respected; mu_hat and sigma_hat default let the OR engine compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given current large in-transit quantity.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019/3/11 (Period 5). Demand history shows recent upward trend (samples: 148,175,160,233,308; mean=204.8) and on-hand=0 with large in-transit=1263 but no concluded arrivals for any prior orders (Periods 1-4 concluded arrived=0). This suggests promised L=4 is not being honored (shipments overdue or lost). To protect service level while we wait for confirmation of arrivals, I explicitly extend the lead time estimate so the OR backend sizes the review+lead demand window conservatively. I use recent_N for mu_hat (use all 5 recent samples to capture the upward demand trend) and default volatility to let the backend compute sigma over full history scaled by (1+L). These settings increase target base-stock to avoid stockouts given missing arrivals while keeping volatility estimate standard. If future concludes show arrivals, revert to shorter L.

Carry-over insight: No concluded arrivals for orders placed in Periods 1-4 (Periods 1-4 conclude: arrived=0) despite in-transit >1200 \u2014 indicate possible lost/very-delayed shipments; treat lead-time as extended until arrivals conclude.

610776002: ordered=407, arrived=314 units (ordered on Period 1, lead_time was 4 periods), starting on-hand inventory=314, demand=252, sold=252, ending on-hand inventory=62

Daily Reward (R_t): $442.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). Recent concluded arrival: Period 5 shows arrived=314 (ordered Period 1) => observed lead_time=4 periods, matching promised lead time. Current on-hand=62, in-transit=1356 (many units en route). Historical demand samples: [148,175,160,233,308] mean=204.8. To keep the OR engine aligned with observed lead time and full-sample demand statistics, use default lead time and population-based demand moments: L=default (promised), mu_hat=default ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples), sigma_hat=default (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples). This keeps the backend's base-stock anchored to the full-sample mean/variance while recognizing arrivals have so far confirmed L=4.

Carry-over insight: Observed actual lead time confirmed = 4 periods (Period 5 conclude: ordered on Period 1 arrived in Period 5; lead_time=4).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). Recent concludes show arrivals from orders placed in Periods 1 and 2 arrived with lead_time=4 (Period 5 conclude: ordered Period 1 arrived, lead_time=4; Period 6 conclude: ordered Period 2 arrived, lead_time=4). On-hand=113, in-transit=1035; earlier long in-transit backlog now producing 4-period arrivals, so treat actual lead time as 4. Use L='calculate' to let backend average observed lead times (evidence supports 4). Demand history provided and no clear regime shift beyond backlog; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time confirmed = 4 periods (evidence: Period 5 conclude: ordered on Period 1 arrived in Period 5, lead_time=4; Period 6 conclude: ordered on Period 2 arrived in Period 6, lead_time=4).

Daily Reward (R_t): $634.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). Recent concluded messages confirm actual lead time = 4 (Periods 5-7 show orders from Periods 1-3 arriving with lead_time=4). On-hand=94, in-transit=836; previous long no-arrival window resolved\u2014treat lead time as 4. Demand has shifted upward recently (concluded demands last 5 periods: 306,283,252,270,364 \u2192 mean \u2248295), so I use a recent-window forecast to capture elevated demand and volatility. Choices: L set to calculated average of observed lead times to reflect confirmed L=4; mu_hat uses recent_N (N=5) so base-stock = (1+L)\xd7recent mean to cover review+lead demand; sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=5) to reflect current volatility and avoid understock given higher recent variance. These parameters prioritize service (profit > holding cost) while limiting excess holding given on-hand+pipeline.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08 (Period 9). On-hand=5, in-transit=920. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (Period 5 conclude: ordered P1 arrived in P5; Period 6 conclude: ordered P2 arrived in P6; Period 7 conclude: ordered P3 arrived in P7). Early missing arrivals (Periods 1-4 conclude: arrived=0) resolved by these concludes, so treat lead time as 4. Demand has been running ~250\u2013370 recently with an upward shift from Period 5 onward (periods 5\u20138 demands = 252,270,364,372). To capture the recent higher demand regime use a recent_N forecast for mu_hat based on the last 5 demand observations; use calculate for L to reflect confirmed observed lead times; keep sigma_hat at default to let backend scale variability with (1+L). This balances service (avoid stockouts given high pipeline) vs holding cost by using recent demand mean while relying on backend volatility estimate.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods; evidence: Period5 conclude: order on P1 arrived in P5 (lead_time=4); Period6 conclude: order on P2 arrived in P6 (lead_time=4); Period7 conclude: order on P3 arrived in P7 (lead_time=4).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). Recent concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (Period5-9 conclude messages confirm orders placed in P1-P5 arrived with lead_time=4). On-hand=141, in-transit=940 \u2014 pipeline is large but arrivals have been consistent at L=4 so we trust promised lead time. Demand history available; no clear recent demand regime shift requiring a recent_N or EWMA override. Use default statistical aggregation so OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, which balances service level versus holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). Recent demand history shows elevated weekly demand (historical sample mean = 204.8 units/week from provided samples). Actual lead time has been confirmed at 4 periods in prior concludes; promised lead time = 4. On-hand = 0, in-transit = 1256 which comfortably covers expected (1+L)-period demand under historical mean (5\xd7204.8\u22481024). No new evidence of lost shipments since multiple concludes confirmed 4-period arrivals. I therefore use the promised lead time and default demand/volatility estimators so the OR backend computes base-stock from the full-sample mean and std, keeping policy stable while pipeline clears.

Daily Reward (R_t): $292.00

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). Recent realized demand has jumped (notably Period 11 demand=564 vs earlier samples), while on-hand=0 and large in-transit=1264. Concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods, matching the promise, so use default L. To capture the recent demand regime shift and higher volatility, compute mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent observations (recent_N=5) so the OR engine sizes inventory to meet elevated near-term demand while limiting excess holding.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time confirmed = 4 periods (evidence: Period5 conclude: P1\u2192P5; Period6 conclude: P2\u2192P6; Period7 conclude: P3\u2192P7; Period8 conclude: P4\u2192P8; Period9 conclude: P5\u2192P9; Period11 conclude: P7\u2192P11).

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/6 (Period 13). Recent concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods and large in-transit balances have resolved, so keep promised lead time. Demand has accelerated in recent periods (notably periods with demands 372,271,310,564,424) \u2014 use a recent-window forecast to capture the higher mean and volatility. Set L to default (promised=4). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat (captures last 5 concluded-demand samples: 372,271,310,564,424) so base stock reflects the recent elevated demand and preserves service while limiting excess holding given holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time confirmed = 4 periods (evidence: P5 conclude P1\u2192P5; P6 conclude P2\u2192P6; P7 conclude P3\u2192P7; P8 conclude P4\u2192P8; P9 conclude P5\u2192P9; P11 conclude P7\u2192P11).

Recent conclude messages consistently confirm actual lead time = 4 periods; promised lead time=4 and arrivals since Period5 align with L=4. On-hand=8, in-transit=1293 (large pipeline). Given stable confirmed lead time and no recent demand regime change, use default lead time and demand estimators based on all samples so the OR backend computes base-stock from full-sample mean/variance. This avoids overreacting to pipeline fluctuations and addresses prior delayed arrivals by relying on confirmed L=4.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). Recent concluded history consistently shows actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7, P4\u2192P8, P5\u2192P9, P7\u2192P11 confirmations). Current on-hand=0, in-transit=1450 (large pipeline). Demand history samples = [148,175,160,233,308]; no clear regime shift in demand mean/variance. To remain consistent with confirmed actual lead time and to let the OR engine apply its statistical base-stock calculation, use promised/default lead time and default demand statistics (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This balances service level (using confirmed L=4) against holding cost given large in-transit inventory and avoids overreacting to pipeline that is already substantial and historically timely.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:

Recent conclude messages consistently confirm actual lead time = 4 (multiple concludes: P5,P6,P7,P8,P9,P11), in-transit remains high but arrivals have been regular at LT=4. On-hand=127, in-transit=1087. I choose L=default to use promised lead time (4) consistent with observed confirms. For demand I use mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from historical samples; this leverages the full sample set given limited evidence of a persistent demand regime change. This keeps base-stock sizing aligned with observed LT=4 while avoiding overreacting to transient spikes, balancing service level (profit > holding) against holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

Demand context: recent sells high but historical sample set provided (past demands [148,175,160,233,308]). Given clear, stable evidence of 4-period lead time and no new regime detected, use promised/default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend applies its standard (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std calculations. This keeps ordering aligned with observed lead time while letting the backend balance service level vs holding cost.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=0, in-transit=1508 (large pipeline). No new evidence of changed demand regime; use standard demand pooling. Set L to default (promised lead time = 4) and use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This keeps base-stock aligned with confirmed lead time while letting the OR engine cap orders given the large pipeline.

Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple concluded messages P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7, etc.), so treat lead time as the promised/default 4. Pipeline (1478) should cover upcoming demand but arrivals are only visible in next-period concludes. Use default demand/volatility calculations so backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples, allowing the OR engine to compute base_stock and capped order consistent with the confirmed L=4 while avoiding overreacting to transient spikes.

I set L to promised/default because concluded history matches promised lead time and there is no fresh evidence of longer/shorter regime. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples (robust given limited sample set). This yields a base-stock anchored to long-run mean while the large in-transit pipeline reduces urgent ordering; defaults avoid overreacting to short-term noise or transient missing arrivals.

LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019-07-15). On-hand=528, in-transit=1014. Historical conclude messages consistently confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (arrivals for orders placed in P1\u2192P5 through P18\u2192P22 confirm L=4). Demand samples (historical seed) = [148,175,160,233,308]. Given confirmed stable lead time and no recent regime shift in demand, use promised/default lead time and default demand/statistics to let OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This balances service (maintain coverage over review+lead periods) against holding cost while acknowledging large pipeline.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=722, in-transit=811; pipeline plus on-hand comfortably large versus typical weekly demand. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple conclude messages P5\u2192P9 etc.), so use promised/default lead time. Demand seed samples limited (provided past demands [148,175,160,233,308]); no strong recent regime shift in those seeds or in concluded demand history that would justify recent_N or EWMA adjustments. To keep the OR backend aligned with observed stable LT=4 and the provided demand sample set, use default formulas for mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std. This balances service level (capturing L+1 periods of demand) against holding cost given current high inventory.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Demand context: recent history shows sustained weekly demand with multiple confirmed concluded arrivals indicating actual lead time = 4 periods. Current inventory: on-hand=758, in-transit=808 \u2014 pipeline + on-hand comfortably cover several weeks of demand but holding cost is significant (holding=$1 vs profit=$2). No evidence of recent lost shipments; lead time has been consistently 4. I choose promised/default lead time to match confirmed actuals. Use default demand/volatility calculations so OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level (protects against 4-period lead time) while letting the backend cap orders to control overstock given high holding cost.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=867, in-transit=725 (total pipeline=1,592). Historical small-sample demand mean \u2248203; (1+L)\xd7mean \u22481,014 so current inventory+pipeline comfortably covers review+lead demand. Concluded history consistently shows actual lead time = 4 periods (stable); earlier prolonged delays resolved and arrivals since Period 5 confirm L=4. I therefore use default (promised) lead time and default demand statistics so the OR backend computes base_stock from the full-sample mean/std; this balances service (profit $2 vs holding $1) while avoiding overfitting to short-term noise.

Demand history shows no abrupt downward regime; inventory is healthy vs. pipeline. Use promised/default lead time to align with confirmed actual LT=4. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history, giving a stable base-stock anchored to long-run demand while the OR engine's cap limits order size to reasonable flow. This balances service (profit>holding cost) against carrying cost given large on-hand stock and normal demand variability.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:

Current position: on-hand=959, in-transit=472; no overdue unexplained losses\u2014arrivals have been concluding with 4-period lag consistently. Use promised/default lead time (4) because concluded arrivals confirm it. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat to default (use full-sample mean/std scaled by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L)) to let OR backend compute base-stock balancing profit ($2) vs holding ($1). This conservative choice leverages full history, avoids overreacting to recent variability, and prevents excess ordering given already-high on-hand inventory.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). Historical seed demands mean=204.8 (samples [148,175,160,233,308]). On-hand=917 + in-transit=500 = 1417 units, which covers ~5-period demand (L+1) \xd7 mean \u2248 1,024, so pipeline is healthy. Concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple conclude messages P5\u2192P9, P6\u2192P10, ... up through P32 conclude), so use the promised/confirmed lead time. To keep the OR engine assumptions aligned with observed steady state, use default demand and volatility aggregation ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples). These settings provide a neutral base-stock that balances the $2 profit vs $1 holding cost while respecting the confirmed 4-period lead time and current ample pipeline.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:

Date 2019-09-30 (Period 34). Recent concluded history consistently shows actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple concluded arrivals: P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, ... through P29\u2192P33). Current inventory: on-hand=907, in-transit=478. Given repeated, stable evidence of 4-period actual lead time and no clear demand regime shift from the seed demand samples, use promised lead time (default) so OR backend uses L=4. Use default demand/statistics (backend: (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to keep forecasts stable and avoid overreacting to short-term noise; this balances service level (profit $2 vs holding $1) without inflating safety stock despite healthy on-hand and pipeline. This approach also handles prior delayed arrivals by aligning L with observed 4-period reality.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time confirmed = 4 periods (evidence: repeated concluded arrivals P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7, P4\u2192P8, P5\u2192P9, ... through P29\u2192P33).

Date 2019-10-07 (Period 35). History shows consistent concluded arrivals with measured lead_time = 4 periods across many periods (P5\u2192P9\u2192...\u2192P34), so actual lead time matches promised 4. On-hand=919, in-transit=489; no recent evidence of lost shipments. Use default lead time (promised) and default demand statistics to let OR backend compute base-stock from full-sample mean/variance. This keeps policy stable and leverages long-run demand samples while avoiding overfitting to short-term noise; defaults also let the backend cap orders appropriately given lead time and estimated variability.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/10/14 (Period 36). Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods; on-hand=958 and in-transit=451 (pipeline=1409) which comfortably covers (1+L)=5 periods at typical demand rates. To align with confirmed lead-time and let the OR backend compute demand-over-review+lead forecasts using full sample history, use default lead time and default demand stats so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and scaled std from all samples. This keeps service high given current healthy on-hand while avoiding manual over-adjustment for short-term noise.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time confirmed = 4 periods (consistent concluded arrivals across many periods: e.g. orders on P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7 ... through P31\u2192P35), treat lead time as 4 until new contrary conclude evidence appears.

LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). Demand history shows stable weekly arrivals with actual lead time repeatedly confirmed at 4 periods; on-hand=995, in-transit=393 (healthy buffer). Given consistent evidence that actual lead time = promised 4 and no recent changepoint in demand, use defaults so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility from all samples. This keeps the base-stock aligned with long-run demand and the OR engine's capped ordering while avoiding overreaction to short-term noise.

LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Demand history shows stable weekly demand with multiple concluded arrivals confirming actual lead time = 4 periods. Current inventory: on-hand=1001, in-transit=341. No evidence of lost shipments recently; pipeline + on-hand comfortably covers near-term demand. Use promised/default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend applies full historical mean/variance across the (1+L) review+lead horizon. This balances service (profit $2 vs holding $1) by letting the backend compute the base-stock target and cap using overall historical statistics while avoiding manual over-correction.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (many P1\u2192P5 ... P34\u2192P38 confirms). On-hand=1052, in-transit=303 gives large immediate cover; no current evidence of lost shipments. Use promised/default lead time and default demand estimates so OR backend applies full-sample mean/variance across (1+L) review+lead window, balancing service with holding cost given ample on-hand stock.

Concluded history consistently shows actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple P conclude messages P5..P39 confirm orders arrive after 4 periods). Pipeline plus on-hand is ample vs recent demands; no urgent evidence of lost shipments now. Use promised lead time (default) and default demand/volatility aggregations so OR backend applies (1+L) scaling to historical demand samples; this keeps policy stable and leverages long-run sample stats while preserving service level given profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=1067, in-transit=239. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (many concluded pairs P1\u2192P5 through P37\u2192P41). No recent evidence of lost shipments; therefore use promised lead time and default demand aggregation so the OR backend uses full-sample mean/variance across (1+L) periods. Methods chosen: L=default to reflect stable confirmed LT=4; mu_hat=default to use (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples); sigma_hat=default to use sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples). This balances service (use full history) versus holding cost given large on-hand stock.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time stable at 4 periods; evidence: numerous concluded arrivals showing orders on Period t arriving on Period t+4 (e.g. P1\u2192P5 through P37\u2192P41). Treat LT=4 until contrary conclude evidence appears.

On-hand=973, in-transit=223. Demand history is stable with no recent regime shift. Use promised/default lead time and default demand estimators so OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over full sample set, keeping policy consistent with observed stable LT=4 and avoiding overreaction to transient fluctuations.
