Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
No on-hand or in-transit stock; no concluded arrivals to infer lead time. Historical demand (5 samples) has mean 204.8 and std ~60.11. Promised lead time used (0). No strong calendar-driven uplift expected for a basic women's T-shirt around 2019-02-11 (minor Valentine effect possible but not reliable). Using default/global estimates keeps the OR base-stock aligned with long-run demand while avoiding overreaction to short-term noise.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 conclude shows an order of 234 arrived with lead_time=0; on-hand=0, in-transit=0. No evidence of lead-time drift or demand regime change in the five-sample history. Use observed lead time=0. Use full-history mean/std scaled by (1+L) (L=0) to let the OR engine compute base-stock; profit/holding ratio (2/(2+1)=0.666) implies a moderate service target\u2014no aggressive uplift needed.

Carry-over insight: Observed lead time = 0 periods (Period 1 conclude: ordered=234 arrived=234, lead_time=0).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Observed lead times from concluded periods 1\u20132 are 0; on-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so we must cover current-period demand. Use lead time estimate 0 (average of observed). Historical demand samples mean=204.8 and std\u224866.27 (n=5). With L=0, set mu_hat=(1+L)*mean=204.8 and sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std=66.27 to let OR compute base-stock balancing profit ($2) vs holding cost ($1).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent conclude messages show all orders arriving same-period (observed lead times = 0 for Periods 1\u20133). On-hand and in-transit are zero entering Period 4. I set L based on the observed lead-time average (0). Demand history mean = 204.8 and std \u2248 59.44; with L=0 the review+lead demand \u03bc\u0302 = 204.8 and \u03c3\u0302 = 59.44 (default methods). These parameters tell the OR backend to target the historical mean demand this period while accounting for observed variability; they balance service (cover expected demand) against holding cost given no evidence of longer lead times or lost shipments.

Daily Reward (R_t): $540.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Observed concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 in Periods 1-4 (consistent same-period arrivals). On-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so we must replenish for current demand. Use L="calculate" (average observed lead times=0) because multiple concluded samples confirm same-period lead time. Use mu_hat="default" \u2192 (1+L)*mean(all historical samples)=1*204.8 to reflect long-run demand mean. Use sigma_hat="default" \u2192 sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples)=61.1 to capture observed demand variability. These settings provide the OR engine a base-stock centered on historical mean with measured volatility; given profit $2 vs holding $1 (service quantile ~0.667), this balances service level and holding cost under confirmed zero lead time.

Carry-over insight: Observed sustained lead_time=0 periods 1\u20134 (arrivals: Period1..4 all show lead_time=0).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent concluded periods (1\u20135) show consistent zero actual lead time and elevated demand vs older history. I treat lead time as promised (default=0). Demand has clearly shifted upward; I use recent_N over the last 5 concluded demands (266,316,306,283,252) to capture the new regime. mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last5)=284.6 to meet next-period demand; sigma_hat uses recent_N sample std (\u224826.72) to reflect current variability and set safety stock. This balances higher service level (profit > holding cost) against holding cost by using recent demand stats rather than older lower-demand samples.

Carry-over insight: Sustained actual lead_time=0 observed in concluded periods 1\u20135 (arrivals each show lead_time=0).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25. Recent concluded periods 1\u20136 show consistently fast arrivals (lead_time=0) and elevated demand (~266\u2013316) vs older prior samples. On-hand=27, in-transit=0; with L=0 arrivals are same-period so we must cover only current demand. I set L to promised/default (0) because concluded history shows sustained lead_time=0. I use recent_N for demand (last 6 concluded demands) to capture the new higher-demand regime: mean(266,316,306,283,252,270)=282.17 -> mu_hat=282.17 (review+lead multiplier 1+L=1). For volatility I use recent_N (same 6 samples) to reflect current variability: std(population)=22.49 -> sigma_hat=22.49. These parameters raise the base-stock to meet current demand while avoiding excess holding given holding cost=$1 and profit=$2 (service level tradeoff embedded in OR engine).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Historical concluded periods 1\u20137 show consistent same-day arrivals (lead_time=0) and strong recent demand (period demands: [266,316,306,283,252,270,364], mean=293.857). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish for current-period demand. I use L=default (promised 0) since concluded history shows sustained lead_time=0. I set mu_hat using recent_N=7 to capture the current higher-demand regime: mu_hat=(1+L)*mean(last7)=293.857 (covers review+lead period). I set sigma_hat using recent_N=7 to reflect recent volatility: std(last7)=~35.40. These parameters prompt the OR backend to target a base stock around the recent mean demand while accounting for observed variability, balancing service level against holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08. Recent concluded history shows arrivals every period with lead_time=0 and no in-transit stock; on-hand=0. Demand history (Periods 1-8 demands): [266,316,306,283,252,270,364,372], mean=303.625, std\u224842.01. No evidence of lost or delayed shipments \u2014 continue using promised lead time. Set L=default (promised=0). Use default demand estimates (all-sample mean \xd7 (1+L)) giving mu_hat=303.625 to capture current demand level across the review+lead window. Use default volatility (std of all samples \xd7 sqrt(1+L)) giving sigma_hat\u224842.01 to reflect observed demand variability. These parameters keep the OR base-stock aligned with realized high demand and zero lead time, balancing service level (avoid stockouts) against holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Sustained actual lead_time=0 observed in concluded periods 1\u20138 (arrived each order same period it was ordered).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15 (Period 10). Recent concluded history shows every order from Periods 1\u20139 arrived same period (observed lead_time=0 consistently). On-hand=26, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. I set L=default (promised 0) because observed lead time is consistently 0. Demand has been elevated recently; using recent_N (N=9) for mu_hat captures current regime: mean demand over Periods 1\u20139 = 300, so mu_hat=(1+L)*300=300. sigma_hat use default (std over all samples scaled by sqrt(1+L)) so the OR engine will compute variability from full sample. These parameters keep base-stock aligned with the sustained same-period fulfillment and recent higher demand, balancing service level (meet demand) vs holding cost by relying on recent mean rather than long-ago low values.

Carry-over insight: Sustained actual lead_time=0 observed in concluded Periods 1\u20139 (each order arrived same period it was ordered); evidence: Period 1..9 conclude messages showing arrived units = ordered units, lead_time=0.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/22. On-hand=20, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show sustained actual lead_time=0 for Periods 1\u20139. Use observed lead time=0. Demand history (samples [148,175,160,233,308]) has mean=204.8 and std\u224859.30; with L=0 use default formulas: mu_hat=(1+L)*mean=204.8 to target service while sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std\u224859.30 to size safety stock. This balances profit ($2) vs holding ($1) by using empirical demand stats and observed zero lead time.

Carry-over insight: Sustained actual lead_time=0 observed in concluded Periods 1\u20139 (each order arrived same period it was ordered).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/29. Historical concluded arrivals show sustained actual lead_time=0 for periods 1\u201311 (every order arrived same period). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. No new calendar events affecting demand. I therefore set lead time by calculating the average observed lead times (all zero) and use default demand scaling (no recent changepoint detected in the small sample). This keeps mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples), which lets the OR backend compute a base-stock balancing profit vs. holding cost given observed stable lead time.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). History shows every concluded order (Periods 1\u201312) arrived same period it was ordered (lead_time=0 consistently). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, recent demands include several large weeks (notably Period 11 demand=564, Period 12 demand=424) indicating elevated and volatile recent demand. I therefore keep L at the promised/default (0) because concluded history confirms same-period arrivals. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I select "default" so the OR backend uses the full-sample mean and std (scaled by 1+L) \u2014 this lets the optimizer compute base-stock using all observed demand while the confirmed L=0 ensures orders can cover the same-period demand spikes without inflating pipeline safety. This balances service for recent large demands while avoiding extra holding cost from overstating lead time.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/13. Concluded history shows every past order (Periods 1\u201313) arrived same period ordered \u2192 actual lead_time=0. On-hand=35, in-transit=0; recent demands in concl. history show large variability and several stockouts, so keep demand forecast based on full-sample mean. Set L by averaging observed lead times (all 0). Use mu_hat default = (1+L)*mean(all samples)=1*204.8 to represent expected demand over review+lead period. Use sigma_hat default = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples)=~68.15 to capture observed volatility. These settings keep base-stock responsive to high demand spikes (using full-sample mean/volatility) while recognizing zero lead time so replenishment can immediately refill stock, balancing service level vs. holding cost.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/20 (Period 15). Concluded history shows sustained actual lead_time = 0 for all concluded periods (Period 1\u201314), so use promised lead time. Recent demand has shifted up vs. older baseline (last 5 demands: 310, 564, 424, 304, 431 \u2192 mean 406.6, std ~95.33). I target the recent regime using recent_N=5 to capture the higher mean and volatility; using these increases base_stock and safety stock to avoid frequent stockouts given same-day arrivals. L=default keeps orders arriving same period; mu_hat and sigma_hat based on recent demand balance service level (reduce lost sales) against holding cost.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Observed concluded arrivals for Periods 1\u201315 all show lead_time=0 (every order arrived same period it was placed). On-hand=11, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. I set L using calculated average of observed lead times = 0 to reflect consistent same-period arrivals. Demand forecast uses historical sample mean (default) scaled by (1+L) \u2192 mu_hat = 204.8 units (captures baseline demand mean). Volatility uses population std of historical samples (default) \u2192 sigma_hat = 59.29. These settings keep the OR backend's base-stock anchored to the true short lead time and historical demand, balancing service (meet frequent high weekly demand) against holding cost given modest holding=$1 and profit=$2.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
History through Period 16 shows every concluded order arrived same period it was ordered (lead_time=0). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Use promised lead time (0) and default demand estimates from the provided historical samples (mean=204.8, std\u224859.29) so the OR backend computes base_stock from stable historical stats; this balances service (high profit per unit) vs holding cost by relying on established demand mean and observed low lead time.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
History shows every concluded order (Periods 1\u201318) arrived same period it was ordered \u2192 actual lead_time=0. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must rely on immediate replenishment. Use L='default' (promised=0). Use mu_hat='default' as (1+L)*mean(all 18 observed demands)=370.5 to reflect full-sample average demand per period. Use sigma_hat='default' as sqrt(1+L)*std(all 18 demands)=104.42 to capture observed volatility (includes several large spikes). These conservative defaults let the OR backend compute the base stock and cap while respecting the demonstrated zero lead time and tradeoff profit vs holding cost.

No evidence of regime change in demand; use promised lead time (0) and default demand estimates from full sample.

Use promised lead time (default). Use default demand estimates based on all provided historical samples (mean demand=204.8 over sample list [148,175,160,233,308]) so mu_hat=(1+L)*mean=204.8.

I set L by averaging observed lead times (calculate) => 0 to reflect consistent same-period arrivals. With L=0 I use historical-demand default assumptions: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) = 204.8 units (mean of [148,175,160,233,308]) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples) = 59.48.

Date 2019/7/15 (Period 23). Historical conclude messages show consistent same-period arrivals (observed lead_time=0 across concluded periods 1\u201322), so use promised lead time. No evidence of lost shipments or lead-time drift. I use default statistics from provided historical demand samples (5 samples) to keep the OR engine aligned with long-run demand; this yields mu_hat = mean demand and sigma_hat = sample std. These parameters maintain service vs holding balance given profit $2 and holding $1 (OR backend will compute z* from profit/(profit+holding)=0.666...).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-22 (Period 24). On-hand=168, in-transit=0. Concluded history shows every order (Periods 1\u201323) arrived same period it was ordered \u2192 actual lead time stable at 0. Use L='default' (promised lead time 0) to match observed behavior. Demand prior (historical demand samples provided) mean = 204.8; use mu_hat='default' => (1+L)*mean = 204.8 to represent expected demand over review+lead period. Use sigma_hat='default' => sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples) = 59.32 to reflect observed variability. These settings keep target base-stock aligned with stable zero lead time and observed demand, balancing service level (given profit/holding tradeoff) while avoiding excess holding given current on-hand inventory.

Carry-over insight: Sustained actual lead_time=0 observed in concluded Periods 1\u201323 (every concluded message shows arrived units = ordered units, lead_time=0).

I therefore use promised lead time (default L=0). Use default demand estimators (all historical samples) because no clear recent changepoint in the provided five-sample historical series. mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(samples) = 204.8 units (mean of [148,175,160,233,308]). sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(samples) = 60.95 (population std \u224860.95). These settings keep the OR backend aligned with observed zero lead time and the long-run demand mean/volatility, balancing service level (via base-stock) against holding cost.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). Historical concluded messages show sustained actual lead_time=0 for all concluded periods; on-hand=265, in-transit=0. Use promised lead time (0) since concluded history consistently confirms same-period arrivals. Use default demand estimates based on the provided historical samples [148,175,160,233,308]: mean=204.8, std\u224859.28. With L=0 the OR engine expects (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std \u2014 so mu_hat=204.8 and sigma_hat=59.28. This keeps service level driven by the historical mean while avoiding extra inventory given currently high on-hand and zero pipeline.

Date 2019/8/19 (Period 28). On-hand=242, in-transit=0. Concluded history shows sustained actual lead_time=0 in all concluded periods (Period 1\u201327). Demand context: recent weeks show moderate demand variability but no clear upward seasonality. Given consistent same-period arrivals, use promised lead time. Use default statistical estimators (all historical samples) so OR engine retains full-sample mean/variance signal. This balances service (use full-sample mean) against holding cost since on-hand is already healthy.

Daily Reward (R_t): $117.00

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Observed concluded arrivals through Period 28 show actual lead time = 0 each period. On-hand = 199, in-transit = 0. Use lead time estimate L=0 (calculated from observed lead times). With L=0, use default demand estimates from the provided historical samples (mean-based) to avoid overfitting to recent ordering adjustments. This yields mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(samples) = 204.8 and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(samples) = 59.289. These parameters keep the OR backend's base-stock near historical average demand while reflecting low lead time to prioritize service and limit excess holding costs given current healthy on-hand inventory.

On-hand=206, in-transit=0; recent weekly demand has been near ~135\u2013145 in Sept but long-run sample mean from provided historical demand data is 204.8. Use promised lead time (0) because concluded history consistently confirms L=0. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'default' (all-sample) to align with OR engine expectations and avoid overreacting to recent lower September demand; this balances service level (profit $2 vs holding $1) by targeting mean demand with measured uncertainty.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:

Demand history (seed samples) = [148,175,160,233,308], mean=204.8, std\u224859.45. I set L to promised/default=0 given sustained evidence. I use default demand estimates (mu_hat = (1+L)*mean = 204.8) and default volatility (sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std = 59.45). These choices keep the OR engine's base-stock anchored to long-run sample mean while respecting observed zero lead time so orders can replenish within the same period, balancing service level (profit $2) vs holding cost ($1).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-07 (Period 35). On-hand=228, in-transit=0. Historical concluded messages show sustained actual lead_time=0 through Period 34 (every order arrived same period ordered). No recent changepoint in demand detected; base historical demand samples are stable. Use promised lead time (default L=0). Use default demand estimates so the OR engine computes base_stock from full-sample mean/std; this balances service (profit $2 vs holding $1) without overstating demand given current on-hand buffer.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-14 (Period 36). On-hand=245, in-transit=0. Historical concluded messages (Periods 1\u201335) consistently show arrivals same period as order \u2014 sustained actual lead_time=0. Recent demand (35 samples) mean \u2248278.03 units/week, std \u2248136.63. I use promised lead time (default L=0) because concluded history confirms 0; mu_hat and sigma_hat set to defaults so OR backend uses full-sample mean and volatility across the review+lead period ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This balances service (targeted by profit/holding tradeoff) while avoiding overreacting to recent week-to-week noise; on-hand inventory (245) plus zero pipeline implies moderate orders if backend base-stock calls for replenishment.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/10/21 (Period 37). Historical concluded messages show sustained actual lead_time = 0 for all concluded periods (Periods 1\u201336). Demand history (Periods 1\u201336) has mean \u2248272.64 and sample std \u2248136.66. Promised lead time is 0 and concluded evidence confirms it; use promised/default lead time. Use default demand estimates (1+L)\xd7mean and default sigma (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR backend's base-stock ties to long-run demand and observed variability, balancing service level (high profit/holding tradeoff) against holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Sustained actual lead_time=0 periods (evidence: concluded messages Periods 1\u201336 all show arrived=ordered, lead_time=0).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). History shows sustained actual lead_time=0 through Period 37 (every concluded order arrived same period). On-hand=213, in-transit=0. Use L='default' (promised lead time 0) because concluded history consistently confirms same-period arrivals. Set mu_hat='default' to use full-sample mean demand (no clear recent regime shift needing recency weighting); this yields (1+L)*mean = 204.8 units. Set sigma_hat='default' to capture historical variability: sqrt(1+L)*std_all = 59.33. These settings give the OR backend unbiased base-stock anchored to long-run mean while reflecting observed volatility and confirmed zero lead time, balancing service (higher mu_hat) against holding cost given current healthy on-hand stock.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). Historical concluded messages (Periods 1\u201338) consistently show orders arriving same period (lead_time=0). On-hand=241, in-transit=0. No calendar spikes noted. Use promised lead time=0. Use default demand estimates based on all historical seed samples (mean=204.8, std\u224859.28) scaled by (1+L) with L=0 to let OR backend compute base-stock; this balances service (profit>holding) while avoiding excess inventory given steady recent arrivals.

Date 2019/11/11. On-hand=254, in-transit=0. Historical concluded messages (Periods 1\u201339) consistently show actual lead_time=0 (orders arrived same period). Demand history (seed samples) mean=204.8, std\u224860.99. I use promised lead time (default=0) since concluded history confirms L=0. Set mu_hat to default (1+L)*mean = 204.8 to reflect long-run demand; set sigma_hat to default sqrt(1+L)*std = 60.991 to capture observed variability. These parameters balance service (using historical mean and observed variability) while avoiding excess holding given current on-hand stock.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). No new news; historical concluded messages show sustained actual lead_time = 0 across all observed periods. On-hand = 242, in-transit = 0. Use promised lead time (0) and default demand estimates based on full historical sample (periods 1\u201340) to let the OR backend compute base-stock with the established profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). Product is a basic women's jersey T-shirt; no special calendar spike this week. Historical concluded messages show consistent same-period arrivals (lead_time=0) throughout Periods 1\u201341, so no evidence of lost or delayed shipments. I therefore use the promised/default lead time. Demand history shows no recent structural regime shift requiring recency weighting, so I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as defaults (OR engine will scale by 1+L). These settings keep service level driven by profit/holding tradeoff while avoiding unnecessary inventory build-up given stable arrivals.

LLM Rationale:

Use promised/default lead time=0. Use historical demand samples to set forecast: mean of samples = 204.8 \u2192 mu_hat=(1+L)*mean=204.8. Demand std dev (sample) = 66.27 \u2192 sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std=66.27.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09 (Period 44). Concluded history shows sustained actual lead_time=0 in all concluded periods (consistent arrivals same period ordered). Use promised lead time (default). Historical seed demand samples (provided) have mean=204.8; no recent changepoint or calendar spike evident that warrants deviating from the historical estimator. Choosing L=0 (default) keeps review+lead horizon =1 period. mu_hat default = (1+L)*mean_all = 204.8 balances service vs holding given profit=$2 and holding=$1 (Q\u22480.667). sigma_hat default uses std of all samples (sample std \u224866.27) scaled by sqrt(1+L)=1, providing the OR engine with realistic uncertainty for safety stock while avoiding excess holding since on-hand=240 is already healthy.

Carry-over insight: sustained lead_time=0 periods; evidence: concluded Periods 1..43 show arrived=ordered, lead_time=0.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/16. Historical concludes show sustained actual lead_time=0; on-hand is high (243) and recent weekly demand has fallen vs earlier months. I use promised lead time (default 0) since concluded history confirms 0. Forecast (mu_hat) uses recent_N=5 (Periods 40\u201344 demands: 69,67,109,61,55) to reflect the current lower-demand regime approaching mid-December; sigma_hat uses the same recent_N=5 sample volatility. These settings reduce over-ordering versus long-run averages while keeping service given current on-hand inventory.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/23 (Period 46). No special calendar events affecting womens basic T-shirt; historical concluded messages show sustained actual lead_time=0 (orders consistently arrived same period). On-hand=179, in-transit=0 so available stock is adequate for short-term demand but holding cost applies. I use L='default' (promised lead time=0) because concluded history strongly supports zero lead time. For demand I use 'default' based on all historical samples (mean demand \u2248204.8 per period) so mu_hat=(1+L)*mean=204.8. Volatility uses 'default' (sample std \u224866.27) so sigma_hat=66.27. These settings tell the OR backend to target a one-period expected demand level with measured variability, balancing service (profit $2 vs stock cost $1) via the built-in z* tradeoff.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30. Historical concluded messages consistently show actual lead_time=0 across many periods; on-hand=200, in-transit=0. No recent regime change in demand detected. Use promised/default lead time=0. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat to defaults (1+L times mean/std of provided historical samples [148,175,160,233,308]) to align OR backend with long-run demand estimates and keep holding vs service tradeoff balanced.
