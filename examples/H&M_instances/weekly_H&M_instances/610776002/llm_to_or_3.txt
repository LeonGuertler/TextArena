Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period start 2019-02-11. On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no concluded arrivals yet so no evidence of lead-time shifts or demand regime change. Historical demands [148,175,160,233,308] provide baseline. Use promised lead time (default) and default demand/volatility calculations so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; conservative approach avoids overfitting to small-sample noise and balances the $2 profit vs $1 holding cost.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/2/18. Recent demand history shows mean demand \u2248204.8 with moderate volatility (samples [148,175,160,233,308]). On-hand = 0, in-transit = 314 (ordered in Period 1) \u2014 no concluded arrivals yet, so do not treat shipments as lost; promised lead time is 2. Use default lead time to reflect the supplier promise and because we lack concluded lead-time evidence. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample set; this balances service level (cover multi-period demand with L=2) against holding cost while we gather arrival confirmations and more demand data.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. On-hand=0, in-transit=321; recent demand samples [148,175,160,233,308] (mean=204.8). One concluded arrival shows observed lead_time=1 (order on P1 arrived on P2). Promised L=2 but observed data indicates shorter lead time; use calculated average lead time to let backend adapt. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std based on chosen L; this balances service (using observed shorter lead time) vs holding cost given modest profit/holding ratio.

Carry-over insight: Observed lead time=1 period (Period2 conclude: ordered on Period1 arrived on Period2); deviates from promised 2-period lead time.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Historical conclude shows an observed lead time of 1 period (Period2 conclude: ordered Period1 arrived Period2), deviating from promised 2. On-hand=0, in-transit=502. I set L to 'calculate' to use the average of observed lead times (captures the 1-period regime). I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014conservative, statistically grounded forecasts that let the OR engine size base stock while the L update addresses the shorter lead-time evidence and mitigates overdue/lost-order risk.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/11. Recent realized demand elevated (Periods1-4 demands = 266,316,306,283) vs older samples; pipeline shows 521 in-transit and on-hand 0 with several overdue arrivals (orders placed in Periods 2-4 not yet concluded). Observed lead time = 1 (Period2 conclude: order on P1 arrived after 1 period) so I set L to 'calculate' to use the average of observed lead times = 1. To capture the recent higher-demand regime, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=4 (last 4 demand samples) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and recent volatility. This balances higher service level needed for elevated demand while avoiding excessive holdings given holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $435.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. On-hand=69, in-transit=279; recent arrivals show variable lead times (observed 1 and 3 periods) and some outstanding orders (periods 3&4) that haven't concluded. To reflect observed lead-time variability use calculate (avg observed lead times = (1+3)/2 = 2). Demand has been high and consistent over the last 5 periods (demands: 266,316,306,283,252) so set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to weight the recent regime. These parameters balance service (capture recent high demand) while sigma_hat captures recent volatility; using calculate for L reconciles promised vs observed lead-time variability and helps the OR backend size orders to cover the (1+L) review+lead horizon.

Carry-over insight: Lead time regime is unstable: observed lead_times = 1 (Period2 conclude for order on P1) and 3 (Period5 conclude for order on P2); average=2. Several orders (ordered P3,P4) remain unarrived\u2014possible lost shipments or extended delays.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). On-hand=0, in-transit=498. Observed lead times = 1 (P2 conclude for order P1), 3 (P5 conclude for order P2), 2 (P6 conclude for order P4) \u2192 average \u22482 and evidence of unstable/extended lead-time regime with some missing arrivals. To reflect actual observed lead-time regime while letting the OR engine compute demand coverage using all samples, set L to calculate (average observed). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) respectively, balancing service level against holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). On-hand=0, in-transit=532. Recent conclues show observed lead_times = 1 (P1->P2), 3 (P2->P5), 2 (P4->P6) \u2192 unstable regime, average \u22482. Several orders (placed P3,P4) never concluded \u2192 possible lost/extended delays; pipeline count (532) likely includes late arrivals. Demand has trended high in recent periods (demands in conclude history: 266,316,306,283,252,270,364) indicating elevated recent demand and a positive changepoint. To be robust to lead-time variability use inferred average lead time (calculate). For demand forecast use recent data to capture increased demand: recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat (uses last 5 samples to reflect higher mean and volatility). These settings raise the base-stock to cover (1+L) periods under the current higher-demand regime while the backend cap prevents excessive single-period orders, mitigating risk from lost shipments.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/8. Recent concludes show unstable lead times: observed W={1,3,2,3,2} (avg=2.2) and multiple overdue/no-arrival events earlier\u2014signal: actual lead time > promised and variable. Demand has stepped up recently (last 5 period demands = [283,252,270,364,372], mean\u2248308). To balance service vs holding cost (profit $2, holding $1 \u2192 target service quantile moderate), I set L to be the calculated average of observed lead times to reflect the recent unstable regime. I use a recent_N (N=5) forecast for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets the current higher-demand regime and captures recent volatility while avoiding stale early samples. This increases pipeline cover for variable lead time and elevated demand, reducing stockouts given possible extended delays.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime remains unstable through Period 8: observed lead_times = [1,3,2,3,2], average=2.2 (use average lead time > promised 2); Recent demand regime increased (Periods 4\u20138 mean \u2248308 units).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). Recent demand has risen (Periods 4\u20138 average \u2248308 units) and observed lead times are unstable: observed lead_times=[1,3,2,3,2] \u2192 avg\u22482.2 with several overdue/unarrived shipments. On-hand=0, in-transit=651 (large pipeline but arrival timing uncertain). I set L to 'calculate' to let the backend use the average of observed lead times (captures the >2 periods regime). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) because a changepoint to a higher-demand regime is evident (use last 5 periods to estimate (1+L)\xd7mean). For volatility I also use recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent variability. These choices bias orders toward covering the elevated near-term demand while accounting for the longer/unstable lead time.

Recent demand regime elevated (Periods 4\u20138 mean \u2248308). To reflect longer/unstable lead time use calculate (avg observed).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). On-hand=0, in-transit=229. Observed lead_times from concluded arrivals = [1,3,2,3,2,3,2], average \u22482.29 \u2192 lead-time regime remains > promised 2 and unstable. Demand has increased recently (recent 5-period mean \u2248376 vs overall mean \u2248:  (148+175+160+233+308)/5=205) so I use a recent-demand forecast. Choose L by 'calculate' to reflect observed average lead time. Set mu_hat to recent_N (N=5) to capture elevated recent demand over the review+lead horizon. Set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=5) to capture recent volatility and feed OR backend higher safety-stock cap. This balances higher service needs (recent demand spike and delayed arrivals) against holding cost.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). Recent demand regime is elevated (Periods 4\u20138 mean \u2248308; recent demands through P12 remain high and volatile). On-hand=0, in-transit=791 \u2014 pipeline is large but contains delayed/irregular arrivals (multiple orders from P3\u2013P4 remain unarrived earlier), so actual lead time appears > promised. I set L explicitly to 2.2 to reflect the observed average lead time (~2.2 periods) rather than the promised 2, so the OR engine will plan across the longer effective pipeline. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to base mu_hat on the most recent high-demand regime (captures Periods 4\u20138 elevated mean). For sigma_hat I use recent_N (N=5) to reflect current higher volatility. These choices prioritize avoiding stockouts during the sustained higher-demand regime while acknowledging longer/unstable lead times and existing in-transit inventory.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=0, in-transit=1331; several earlier orders remain unobserved in concludes (possible extended delays/lost shipments). Observed lead-times from concludes are variable (recent sequence \u2248 [1,3,2,3,2]; avg > promised 2). Recent demand has increased versus earlier periods (last 5 demands = [271,310,564,424,304], mean \u2248373.8). To hedge uncertain/lengthened lead-time I use recent_N for L (captures current regime). To reflect elevated recent demand I set mu_hat recent_N with N=5 (gives (1+L)\xd7recent mean). Volatility also driven by recent large spike (period11=564) so sigma_hat uses recent_N N=5.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime unstable; observed lead_times (from concludes) avg > promised 2 (recent obs [1,3,2,3,2], mean\u22482.2) \u2014 treat lead time as lengthened; Recent demand regime increased: last 5-period mean \u2248373.8 (Periods 9\u201313), higher than earlier baseline.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). On-hand=0, in-transit=1317. Historical concluded lead_times show instability and average > promised (recent observed sequence mean \u22482.2) and several delayed/lost shipments (orders from P3,P4 remained unarrived). Demand regime has risen recently (recent periods show large demands; last 5 concluded demands P10\u2013P14 mean = 406.6). To protect service given stretched/unstable lead times and higher demand, set lead time explicitly to the observed recent average (2.2). Use a recent-5 demand estimate for mu_hat to capture the higher recent mean ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 samples). Use recent-5 for sigma_hat to capture current volatility. This increases target base-stock to balance service vs holding given many in-transit units and elevated demand.

Carry-over insight: Lead time regime remains unstable; observed concluded lead_times [1,3,2,3,2] \u2192 mean\u22482.2, treat effective L>promised 2; Recent demand regime increased: last 5 concluded demands (P10\u2013P14) mean=406.6.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27 (Period 16). Concluded lead-times remain unstable but average > promised: observed concluded lead_times = [1,3,2,3,2,3,2] \u2192 mean\u22482.29, so I use a recent-average lead time to reflect extended/variable transit. Demand has shifted up recently (last 5 concluded demand samples high); to capture the elevated demand regime I use recent-N forecasts for mu and sigma (N=5). On-hand=98 and in-transit=844 gives substantial pipeline, but variable/lengthened lead time risks stockouts if we under-forecast; using recent_N for mu_hat increases base-stock to improve service while recent sigma captures higher volatility for safety stock.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03 (Period 17). On-hand=0, in-transit=777. Observed concluded lead_times = [1,3,2,3,2,3,2,3,2,1] \u2192 mean=2.2, indicating an unstable/lengthened lead-time regime vs promised L=2. Recent demand has risen: last 5 demands (Periods 12\u201316) = [424,304,431,442,435], mean\u2248407.2. To protect service under longer effective lead time and higher recent demand, set L to the observed average (calculate) and base demand forecast on the most recent 5 periods to capture the new higher demand regime; use recent-N volatility (N=5) to reflect current variability. This increases target base-stock to reduce stockouts while the pipeline (777) provides partial cover.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10 (Period 18). Concluded history shows unstable/lengthened lead-times with observed concludes [1,3,2,3,2] \u2192 mean\u22482.2; several orders experienced extended delays or loss. Demand has stepped up recently; last 5 concluded demands (Periods 13\u201317) = [304,431,442,435,640], mean=450.4, indicating a higher recent demand regime. I set L explicit to 2.2 to reflect the empirically longer effective lead time and avoid under-ordering given delayed arrivals. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to anchor forecasts and volatility to the new high-demand regime (N=5 chosen as the recent regime length). These choices bias the OR backend toward higher target base-stock to protect service during extended lead times while capturing recent demand increase.

Carry-over insight: Recent demand regime increased: Periods 13\u201317 mean=450.4 (new higher regime); Effective lead time > promised 2: observed concluded lead_times [1,3,2,3,2], mean\u22482.2 \u2014 treat L\u22482.2.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/17 Period19. History of concludes shows unstable/lengthened lead times with observed concluded lead_times = [1,3,2,3,2] \u2192 mean\u22482.2 and multiple overdue/unarrived orders (signals of extended delays or lost shipments). Recent demand regime elevated: recent 5-period mean (Periods13\u201317) \u2248450.4, well above earlier baseline. To protect service given extended lead times and higher demand, set L explicitly to 2.2 (captures effective delay). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to anchor forecast on the new high-demand regime ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 demands). Use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices increase target base-stock to cover the longer effective lead time and higher recent demand while keeping variability estimate tied to the same recent window.

Carry-over insight: Effective lead time elevated above promised 2; observed concluded lead_times [1,3,2,3,2] mean\u22482.2 \u2192 treat L\u22482.2; Recent demand regime increased, recent 5-period mean (Periods13\u201317) \u2248450.4.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24 (Period 20). History shows concluded lead_times repeatedly unstable with recent observed mean \u22482.2 (> promised 2) and several overdue/unconcluded shipments; demand has stepped up recently (last 5 concluded demands P15\u2013P19 mean = 475 units). To guard against extended/variable lead time I set L explicitly to 2.2. For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the new higher-demand regime for (1+L) review+lead demand. Volatility also set to recent_N (N=5) to reflect increased variance in the same window. These choices bias orders upward to cover longer-than-promised lead times and higher recent demand while letting the OR backend compute service-level safety stock vs holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Effective lead time elevated above promised (use L\u22482.2 based on concluded lead_times mean); Recent demand regime increased\u2014last 5 concluded demands (Periods15\u201319) mean=475 units.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/1 (Period 21). Recent concluded lead_times remain [1,3,2,3,2] -> mean\u22482.2, and recent demand has risen sharply. On-hand=0, in-transit=1592 (pipeline large but many past promised arrivals were delayed). To account for longer effective lead time and elevated recent demand, set L explicitly to 2.2. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor forecast/volatility to the most recent high-demand regime (last 5 concluded demands). This raises target base stock to cover the longer effective lead time and current demand spike while sigma_hat recent_N tightens variability estimate to recent behavior.

Carry-over insight: Effective lead time remains elevated above promised 2; observed concluded lead_times=[1,3,2,3,2], mean\u22482.2 (treat L\u22482.2). Recent demand regime increased: Periods 16\u201320 mean demand \u2248446.8 (higher sustained demand).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/8 (Period 22). Demand has risen recently (sustained high demands in Periods ~13\u201321) and concluded lead-times have been unstable (multiple observed concludes: mix of 1\u20133 periods). On-hand=417, in-transit=943 \u2014 pipeline is sizable but several past orders were delayed/lost before concluding. To reflect the observed lead-time instability I let the backend compute the empirical average lead time from concluded messages (method=calculate). For demand I lean on the most recent regime (last 5 periods) to capture the elevated mean and volatility: use recent_N N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the base-stock calculation adapts to higher recent demand and higher variability. This balances holding cost vs service by raising target stock to cover the longer effective lead-time and recent demand spike while relying on pipeline visibility to avoid over-ordering.

To account for the empirically longer lead time, set L estimation to the calculated average of observed lead times so the OR backend increases safety/pipeline coverage. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new higher-demand regime and recent volatility rather than diluting with old low-demand samples. These choices prioritize covering the extended effective lead time and higher recent demand to avoid stockouts while the OR backend will convert these into a base-stock with service-level trading off holding cost.

Historical concluded lead_times remain unstable but average \u22482.2 (observed concluded lead_times cluster [1,3,2,3,2] \u2192 treat effective L>promised). Recent demand has varied; using the most recent 5-period demand sample to capture the current regime while keeping responsiveness. Using explicit L=2.2 captures the empirically lengthened lead time; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N (N=5) to reflect the latest demand level and volatility.

On-hand=0, in-transit=982 (large pipeline exists; several prior orders showed long/variable delays). Recent demand samples (Periods 20\u201324) show mean \u2248238, so short-run demand has moderated vs earlier spikes; to be responsive to the most recent regime while accounting for extended lead times, I set L explicitly to 2.2, use a recent_N mu_hat (N=5) to base the (1+L)-period demand forecast on the last 5 demands, and use recent_N sigma_hat (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep target base-stock aligned to current observed demand while inflating lead-time coverage to mitigate lost/extended shipments and reduce stockouts given the unstable lead-time regime.

Historical concluded lead_times remain unstable with observed values [1,3,2,3,2] (mean\u22482.2) \u2014 use explicit L=2.2 to reflect effective longer lead time and possible lost/extended shipments. Recent realized demand (Periods 23\u201327 = [212,207,154,102,120]) shows a lower recent regime; use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend sizes the (1+L)-period forecast to current lower demand. This balances avoiding excess holding on a large in-transit position while protecting service given lengthened lead time.

Carry-over insight: New: Recent demand has fallen \u2014 Periods 23\u201327 mean \u2248159 (downshift from earlier high-regime); continue treating effective lead time > promised (observed concluded mean\u22482.2).

Because concluded lead-time evidence consistently averages >2, set explicit L=2.2 to reflect effective delivery delay. Demand forecast uses the most recent regime (last 5 periods) so mu_hat recent_N N=5 to capture the lowered demand level. Volatility likewise uses recent_N N=5 to reflect current reduced variability.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:

Date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). Recent concluded lead-times remain unstable but average \u22482.2 (observed concluded lead_times = [1,3,2,3,2]) \u2014 treat effective L > promised. Recent demand has fallen from the earlier high regime: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 25\u201329) = [154,102,120,158,140], mean = 134.8. On-hand = 0, in-transit = 943 (multiple past orders outstanding; some shipments were delayed but many are still in transit). Decisions: set L explicitly to 2.2 to reflect observed concluded lead-time mean and protect against delayed arrivals; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to adapt to the downshift in demand (use the last 5 demands). This reduces target base-stock relative to the prior high demand regime and avoids excess holding cost while accounting for extended lead time and in-transit stock.

Carry-over insight: Effective lead time remains elevated above promised 2; observed concluded lead_times [1,3,2,3,2] \u2192 mean\u22482.2 (treat L\u22482.2). Recent demand has fallen: Periods 23\u201327 mean\u2248159 and last-5 (Periods25\u201329) mean\u2248134.8 \u2014 new lower-demand regime.

LLM Rationale:

Concluded lead-time history remains unstable with observed concluded lead_times [1,3,2,3,2] \u2192 mean\u22482.2, so treat effective L>promised 2 and use explicit L=2.2. Recent demand has fallen from earlier highs; last 5 observed demands (Periods 27\u201331 = 120,158,140,145,141) mean\u2248140.8, so use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to reflect the new low-demand regime. Use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. These choices keep target base-stock aligned to the current (lower) demand regime while accounting for longer effective lead time and avoiding overstock given high in-transit volume.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/09/23 (Period 33). Recent concluded history shows an elevated effective lead time (observed concluded lead_times = [1,3,2,3,2], mean\u22482.2) and a clear downshift in demand since Period 27 (recent 5-period mean \u2248140.8). On-hand=0, in-transit=943 (large pipeline). To protect service given longer effective L while avoiding excess holding during the new low-demand regime, I set L explicitly to the inferred mean (2.2) so the OR backend accounts for longer delivery. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to tie forecasts/volatility to the latest low-demand regime. This keeps target base-stock responsive to the current lower demand and respects the elevated lead-time risk, while the large in-transit pipeline will typically reduce immediate ordering by the OR engine.

Carry-over insight: Recent demand downshift: Periods 27\u201331 mean \u2248140.8 (new lower-demand regime); Effective lead time elevated vs promised: observed concluded lead_times [1,3,2,3,2], mean \u22482.2 \u2014 treat L\u22482.2.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/30 Period34. Recent demand has downshifted: last 5 demands (Periods29\u201333) mean \u2248141.6. Concluded lead-time observations remain unstable with mean \u22482.2 (observed concluded lead_times [1,3,2,3,2]); several earlier orders were delayed or lost, so I treat effective L>promised. Set L explicit=2.2 to reflect empirical concluded lead-time mean and protect against delayed arrivals. For demand forecast use recent_N (N=5) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean of most recent 5 demands (tracks new low-demand regime). Use sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility rather than older high-variance samples. This combination reduces overordering from past high regime while allowing pipeline coverage for the elevated effective lead time.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/10/7 (Period 35). On-hand=0, in-transit=943 (large pipeline). Concluded lead-time history shows unstable regime with observed lead_times = [1,3,2,3,2] \u2192 mean \u22482.2, so I set L explicit=2.2 to reflect effective lead time > promised 2 and to avoid under-ordering. Recent demand has downshifted: last 5 observed demands (Periods 30\u201334) mean \u2248134.8; to focus the forecast on current regime I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7recent mean and volatility. This balances service (longer effective L) against holding cost given a large in-transit position.

Carry-over insight: Effective lead time elevated vs promised: concluded lead_times [1,3,2,3,2] mean\u22482.2 \u2192 treat L\u22482.2; Recent demand downshift: Periods 30\u201334 mean\u2248134.8 (use lower-demand regime).

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-14 (Period 36). On-hand=0, in-transit=943. Concluded lead-times remain unstable but average \u22482.2 periods (use explicit L=2.2 to reflect extended/variable transit & some lost shipments). Recent demand has downshifted \u2014 last 5 concluded demands (Periods 31\u201335) average = 122.8 units; use a short recent window to forecast across review+lead. Methods chosen: L explicit to capture observed longer lead-time regime; mu_hat recent_N (N=5) to base forecast on the recent lower-demand regime; sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These parameters reduce excess ordering versus outdated high-demand regime while accounting for longer effective lead-time so pipeline covers (1+L) periods of demand and balances service level vs holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed recent demand downshift: Periods 31\u201335 mean = 122.8 (new lower-demand regime); Effective lead time remains elevated vs promised: concluded lead_times mean \u22482.2 (treat L\u22482.2).

Recent demand has downshifted; last 5 observed demands (Periods 32\u201336 = 135,147,106,85,84) justify using a recent-N forecast. Choices: set L explicit to 2.2 to reflect observed concluded lead-time mean and capture delayed arrivals; set mu_hat recent_N (N=5) to anchor forecast on the new low-demand regime (reduces over-ordering); set sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent demand volatility. These parameters trade lower target inventory (matching lower demand) against longer effective lead time to avoid stockouts from delayed shipments.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Recent demand has downshifted \u2014 last 5 demands (Periods 33\u201337) = [147,106,85,84,109], mean \u2248106.2. On-hand=0, in-transit=943 (large pipeline from prior orders). Concluded lead-times remain unstable with mean \u22482.2 (observed concluded lead_times [1,3,2,3,2]). I set L explicit=2.2 to reflect elevated effective lead time. For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the new low-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine sizes base stock to current lower demand while accounting for longer effective lead time and large in-transit pipeline. This reduces risk of excess holding given high pipeline and lower realized demand.

Carry-over insight: Recent demand downshift confirmed: Periods 33\u201337 mean \u2248106.2 (new sustained lower-demand regime); Effective lead time remains elevated vs promised: concluded lead_times [1,3,2,3,2] mean \u22482.2 \u2014 treat L\u22482.2.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=943. Concluded lead-times remain unstable but average \u22482.2 (observed concluded lead_times [1,3,2,3,2]) \u2192 treat effective L>promised 2 to guard against delayed arrivals. Recent demand shows a sustained downshift; use last-5 periods to represent the new lower-demand regime and tighter volatility. Choices: L set explicit to 2.2 (matches concluded lead-time mean); mu_hat set to recent_N with N=5 to forecast (1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 demands (captures current low-rate regime); sigma_hat set to recent_N with N=5 to reflect recent demand variability. These settings reduce target base-stock given lower recent demand while accounting for extended lead time to avoid stockouts from delayed arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Recent sustained lower-demand regime confirmed (Periods 33\u201337 recent mean \u2248106); concluded lead-times persist above promised (observed concluded lead_times [1,3,2,3,2], mean\u22482.2) \u2014 treat effective L\u22482.2.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/11 (Period 40). Recent demand has settled into a lower regime: last 5 demands (Periods 35\u201339) mean \u224883.4 units. Concluded lead-time observations remain unstable but average \u22482.2 (observed concluded lead_times [1,3,2,3,2]). On-hand=0, in-transit=943 \u2014 significant pipeline already exists, so use an elevated L to reflect observed longer effective lead time while sizing mu/sigma from the recent low-demand regime to avoid overordering. Chosen: L explicit=2.2 to reflect concluded lead-time mean; mu_hat recent_N N=5 to target (1+L)\xd7recent mean; sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. This balances service (accounting for extended lead time and large pipeline) against holding cost in a low-demand period.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). On-hand=0, in-transit=943 \u2014 large pipeline versus recent demand. Concluded lead-times remain unstable with observed concluded lead_times [1,3,2,3,2], mean\u22482.2 \u2192 use explicit L=2.2 to reflect effective lead time > promised 2. Recent demand regime is low (last 5 periods P36\u2013P40 mean\u224880.2); to avoid excess holding given big in-transit, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 so the OR backend targets (1+L)\xd7recent mean and volatility. This reduces future order quantities versus using long-run averages and helps limit holding cost while acknowledging longer effective lead time.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline large: in-transit=943 units vs recent 5-period demand mean\u224880 units \u2014 do NOT increase ordering; expect elevated holding risk if arrivals continue.

On-hand=0 but in-transit=943 units (very large relative to current demand). To avoid excess holding cost while accounting for extended effective lead time, set L explicitly to 2.2. Forecast demand across review+lead using recent 5-period mean to capture the new low-demand regime (mu_hat recent_N, N=5). Keep sigma_hat as default so OR backend uses full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). This combination prevents additional ordering given the large pipeline and aligns service targets to the lower recent demand with the longer effective lead time.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline large: in-transit=943 vs recent 5-period demand mean\u224876.8 \u2014 do NOT increase ordering; elevated holding risk if arrivals continue.

Historical concluded lead_times remain unstable with mean \u22482.2 (observed concluded = [1,3,2,3,2]). To avoid adding to an oversized pipeline and raising holding cost, treat effective lead time as lengthened (explicit L=2.2) so the OR engine accounts for longer coverage period; keep demand and volatility estimates at backend defaults (use population statistics) because the large in-transit stock dominates ordering decision and will drive order=0 under the capped policy. This choice prevents new receipts and reduces holding risk while reflecting longer lead-time regime for future calculations.

Observed concluded lead-times remain [1,3,2,3,2] (mean\u22482.2) so treat effective L > promised. I set L explicit=2.2 to reflect the elevated/unstable lead-time regime. Demand has shifted to a sustained low regime recently (last 5 demands mean \u224872.2), so use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to anchor the (1+L)-period demand forecast to current low demand. Keep sigma_hat as default to let backend use full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). These choices reduce ordering given large pipeline and lower recent demand while accounting for longer effective lead time to avoid understocking from delayed arrivals.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (Period 46). On-hand=0, in-transit=943 >> recent demand (Periods 41\u201345 mean \u224871). Concluded lead-times remain unstable with observed concluded lead_times = [1,3,2,3,2] \u2192 mean \u22482.2. To avoid increasing an already-large pipeline while accounting for longer effective lead time, set L explicit=2.2. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to anchor the (1+L) demand forecast to the latest low-demand regime (prevents over-ordering). Use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent lower volatility. These settings keep target inventory tied to current low demand and longer realized lead time, minimizing additional arrivals and holding cost risk.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30. On-hand=0, in-transit=943 (very large vs recent demand). Concluded lead_times history = [1,3,2,3,2] \u2192 mean\u22482.2, indicating effective lead time > promised 2 and intermittent delays/lost shipments. Recent demand has downshifted: last 5 observed demands (Periods 42\u201346) mean \u224876.2. To avoid adding to excess pipeline and reflect longer effective lead time, set L explicitly to 2.2. Forecast demand across review+lead using recent data (lower-demand regime): mu_hat recent_N with N=5 (uses last 5 demands). Volatility is best captured from recent observations as well: sigma_hat recent_N with N=5. These choices reduce ordering given large in-transit inventory, align safety stock to elevated actual lead time, and prioritize holding-cost avoidance while maintaining service under the new low-demand regime.
