Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. SKU 610776002 is a basic women's T-shirt (stable, non-seasonal). Profit $2 / unit, holding $1 / unit/period. On-hand=0, In-transit=0, and there are no concluded arrivals to infer lead-time deviations or lost shipments. Historical demands = [148,175,160,233,308]. With no evidence of a changepoint in demand or lead time, use the environment defaults so the OR engine computes base stock using promised lead time (4) and full-sample mean/std. This ensures orders cover the (L+1) review+lead demand while avoiding arbitrary manual overrides given limited signal.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/2/18. Recent observed demands = [148,175,160,233,308] (mean ~205). On-hand=0, in-transit=314 (order placed Period 1) but no concluded arrivals yet, so actual lead time cannot be inferred\u2014do not assume loss. Use promised lead time and population stats: set L=default (promised=4). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples, which balances service level (covers L+1 periods) against holding cost given profit=2 and holding=1.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). Recent demand samples = [148,175,160,233,308], mean=204.8. On-hand=0, in-transit=635 (orders 314+321) but no concluded arrivals yet\u2014shipments delayed. I keep L as promised (default) because we have no concluded lead-time observations to compute an empirical lead time; using defaults for mu_hat and sigma_hat applies the OR engine's (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std based on full sample set, balancing service level against holding cost while awaiting arrival confirmation or loss signals.

Carry-over insight: Delayed arrivals: orders placed in Period 1 (314) and Period 2 (321) have not concluded by Period 3; in-transit=635. Treat as shipment delay risk until/if arrivals conclude.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/4. On-hand=0, in-transit=980 (orders from P1-P3 still outstanding). These outstanding shipments are expected under the promised lead time (4), so do not assume longer lead time yet. Use promised lead time to align with OR engine assumptions. Demand history shows mean ~204.8 over 5 samples; use default aggregated estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR backend computes base-stock and cap consistently. This keeps ordering responsive to historical demand while avoiding premature inflation of lead time amid in-transit shipments that have not yet concluded.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). On-hand=0, in-transit=1263 (sum of orders P1-P4). No concluded arrivals in history; no observed lead-times to average. Given insufficient evidence of lost shipments or a different lead-time, use promised lead time (default) and default demand estimates based on all samples (mean across [148,175,160,233,308]) so the OR engine computes base_stock and caps consistently. This keeps the policy conservative against premature assumptions about longer lead times while the pipeline remains large.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent realized demands (Periods 1-5) are elevated and stable around ~284 units/period (266,316,306,283,252). One concluded arrival shows order placed in Period 1 arrived with lead_time=4, matching promised L=4. Multiple subsequent orders (Periods 2-4) remain in-transit and overdue, indicating shipment delay risk but not yet confirmed lost. To prioritize service given high recent demand and modest holding cost, set lead-time estimate from observed data (calculate). Forecast demand across review+lead (1+L periods) using the last 5 periods to capture the recent higher regime (recent_N, N=5). Match sigma to recent variability (recent_N, N=5) so the OR backend increases base-stock for current higher demand while accounting for observed shipment delays.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed lead_time=4 for order from Period 1 (arrived in Period 5); orders from Periods 2-4 remain outstanding in-transit \u2192 ongoing shipment delay risk; recent demand regime elevated (Periods 1-5 mean ~284).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). Recent demand regime elevated: Periods 1-6 demands = [266,316,306,283,252,270] (recent mean ~282\u2013284). Observed concluded arrivals show lead_time=4 for orders from Periods 1 and 2, and arrivals for Periods 2-4 remain outstanding but recent confirms actual lead_time=4. To reflect confirmed lead-time while biasing forecast to the most recent elevated demand regime, set L using observed lead-times average; set mu_hat from the most recent 5 demand samples to capture current regime; use default sigma (all samples) to avoid overfitting volatility given limited data. This balances service level (captures higher recent demand) versus holding cost (avoids extreme safety stock increases) and accounts for shipment delay risk by using confirmed L=4.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed lead_time=4 (arrivals: Period1->arrived in Period5; Period2->arrived in Period6); ongoing shipment delay risk\u2014orders from Periods 3-4 remain outstanding in-transit. Recent demand regime elevated: Periods 1-6 mean \u2248282\u2013284 (use recent window).

Daily Reward (R_t): $634.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). Recent demand regime is elevated vs historical: periods 1\u20136 average \u2248283 (high and rising; period7=364). On-hand=94, in-transit=1020 (orders from Periods 4\u20137 sum to 1020) \u2014 pipeline large and arrivals are staggered but prior concludes confirm actual lead_time=4 for earlier shipments (Periods 1\u20133). I set L=calculate to let backend use observed lead times (confirmed 4). For demand I use recent_N (N=6) to capture the sustained elevated demand regime (periods 2\u20137), so mu_hat covers review+lead demand under the recent higher mean. I keep sigma_hat=default so the backend computes volatility from full sample history scaled by sqrt(1+L); this balances measured variability with the larger recent mean. These choices increase target base-stock to meet higher demand while relying on observed lead-time behavior to avoid under-ordering despite earlier delays.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed lead_time=4 for orders from Periods 1\u20133 (arrived in Periods 5\u20137); large outstanding pipeline (in-transit=1020 from orders in Periods 4\u20137) expected to arrive under the 4-period regime; recent demand regime elevated \u2014 periods 1\u20136 mean \u2248283 (period7 spike to 364).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08 (Period 9). Recent concludes (Periods 5-8) consistently show lead_time=4 for orders placed in Periods 1-4; pipeline remains large (in-transit=1146) and on-hand is low (5). Recent demand regime is elevated vs older samples: Periods 1-6 demand mean \u2248282. I set L=calculate to use observed lead times (confirmed 4-period regime). For mu_hat I choose recent_N (N=6) to capture the elevated recent mean across Periods 1-6 so backend uses (1+L)*recent_mean \u22485*282. For sigma_hat I choose recent_N (N=6) to reflect recent demand volatility. These choices keep base_stock aligned to the sustained higher demand and the confirmed 4-period lead time while letting the OR engine cap orders using its risk cap; using recent windows also helps avoid overreacting to the two large spikes in Periods 7-8 which are included only if backend needs them.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed lead_time=4 (Periods 1\u20134 arrivals in Periods 5\u20138); recent demand regime elevated (Periods 1\u20136 mean \u2248282); large outstanding pipeline/in-transit (1146 units) \u2014 treat as ongoing shipment delay risk until further conclude messages.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019/4/15). On-hand=0, in-transit=1514 (large outstanding pipeline). Concluded arrivals in Periods 5\u20139 show consistent lead_time=4 for arrivals (orders from Periods 1\u20135 arrived in Periods 5\u20139), so use observed lead time. Recent demand regime elevated: demands in Periods 1\u20136 have mean \u2248283 (samples: [148,175,160,233,308,266,316,306,283,252,270,364,372,271] with recent high levels in Periods 5\u20139). To balance service and holding cost given the large in-transit pipeline and persistent 4-period lead time, set L using calculated average observed lead times, and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent window to capture the elevated recent demand (N=6) so the backend's base-stock and caps reflect the higher short-term demand while avoiding overreaction to older low samples.

Carry-over insight: Ongoing shipment delay risk: large pipeline/in-transit (1514) remains outstanding; confirmed actual lead_time=4 from multiple concluded arrivals; recent demand regime elevated (recent 6-period mean \u2248283).

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/22 (Period 11). On-hand=19, in-transit=1232. Historical concludes consistently show lead_time=4 (arrivals from Periods1\u20136 confirmed at W=4). Recent demand regime elevated (use recent 6-period window: Periods 5\u201310 demands = [252,270,364,372,271,310], mean \u2248 306; earlier periods 1\u20134 also high). To protect service with confirmed LT=4 and elevated recent demand while avoiding excessive extra safety, set L to promised (default) and estimate demand over review+lead using recent_N=6. Use recent_N=6 for sigma to reflect recent volatility including spikes (period7\u20138). This balances higher service need against holding cost given large existing pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead_time=4 from multiple concluded arrivals (orders placed Period1\u20136 arrived in Periods5\u201310); recent demand regime elevated \u2014 recent 6-period mean (Periods5\u201310) \u2248306 with high variance; large outstanding pipeline/in-transit (1232 units) \u2014 treat as ongoing shipment delay risk until further conclude messages.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/29 (Period 12). On-hand=0, in-transit=1177; concluded history consistently shows actual lead_time=4. Recent demand has risen sharply (most recent 6 demands: P6\u2013P11 = 270,364,372,271,310,564; mean \u2248358.5) indicating an elevated demand regime and high variance. Use promised/confirmed lead time (default) so OR backend schedules over the 5-period coverage window. Set mu_hat using a recent_N window (N=6) to capture the current elevated mean across the review+lead horizon. Keep sigma_hat at default so the backend uses full-sample volatility scaled for the chosen lead time; this balances higher service level from elevated mu_hat while letting backend account for historical variability. This approach also guards versus lost shipments by relying on concluded lead-time evidence and recent demand observations.

Recent demand regime is elevated with high variance (notably periods 5\u201311). To avoid understock while large pipeline remains and demand stayed high, use promised/default lead time and base demand estimates on a recent window (captures regime shift). mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N to reflect elevated mean and volatility from the latest periods.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/13 (Period 14). History shows repeated concluded arrivals with lead_time=4 and a large outstanding pipeline (in-transit=1453) and on-hand=86. Recent demand regime is elevated (multiple periods with demand ~270\u2013564; recent 6-period mean \u2248283). To respect observed stable actual lead time and elevated demand, use promised/default lead time (4). For demand forecast use a recent-window estimate (capture elevated regime) based on the most recent 5 demand samples. Keep sigma as default to reflect overall sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). These settings raise target base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of elevated demand while keeping volatility-driven safety stock handled by the backend.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained actual lead_time=4 from multiple concluded arrivals (orders placed Period1\u20139 arriving in Period5\u201313); recent demand regime elevated (recent 6-period mean \u2248283) with high variance; large outstanding pipeline/in-transit (currently 1453) \u2014 treat as ongoing shipment delay risk until further conclude messages.

LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20): on-hand=0, in-transit=1835; historical concludes confirm sustained actual lead_time=4 (multiple arrived messages). Recent demand regime is elevated with high variance (recent periods show strong demand spikes and a ~6-period elevated mean). To match observed lead_time while letting OR backend use promised lead time data, set L to calculated-average (confirming 4). Use recent_N window to capture the elevated demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=6 covers the most recent stable elevated period and balances sample size vs recency). This keeps target base_stock responsive to higher recent demand while sigma_hat recent_N captures increased volatility, helping the OR engine balance service level vs holding cost given large in-transit pipeline and zero on-hand.

Set L by calculating observed lead times to lock in the confirmed L=4; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent_N=6 window to reflect the elevated mean and volatility and to size (1+L) coverage while avoiding overreaction to single spikes.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10 (Period 18). History of concluded arrivals shows consistent actual lead_time=4 (multiple concluded orders with W=4). Current inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=1607 \u2014 large pipeline that will cover multiple future periods. Recent demand has stepped up: last 6 concluded period demands (Periods 12\u201317) = [424, 304, 431, 442, 435, 640], mean \u2248 446 indicating a higher-demand regime and high variance. Given confirmed LT=4 and an elevated recent demand regime, set L using observed lead times (average) and set demand forecast using a recent 6-period window to capture the new regime. Sigma set from the same recent window to reflect increased volatility. This balances service (avoid stockouts while large pipeline may arrive) against holding cost by aligning mu_hat to recent elevated demand and reflecting true LT.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-17 (Period 19). Observed confirmed actual lead_time=4 across many concluded arrivals and a very large outstanding pipeline (in-transit=1803) \u2014 treat as 4-period regime. Recent demand has shifted up sharply: last 6 concluded demands (Periods 13\u201318) = [304,431,442,435,640,419], mean \u2248445 with high variance. On-hand=10 so replenishment must rely on in-transit and forecast. Choose L=default to reflect the stable confirmed 4-period lead time (matches promised lead time). Use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat to capture the elevated recent-demand regime across the review+lead horizon. Use recent_N (N=6) for sigma_hat to capture the higher observed volatility and to prevent under-ordering given the large pipeline and service-focus of profit/holding ratio.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained actual lead_time=4 from multiple concluded arrivals (orders placed Period1\u201314 arriving in Period5\u201318); recent demand regime materially elevated \u2014 recent 6-period mean (Periods13\u201318) \u2248445 with high variance; very large outstanding pipeline/in-transit (1803) \u2014 ongoing shipment delay risk until further conclude messages.

Demand has been elevated and volatile recently; I use a recent_N window to capture the current regime: N=6 (Periods 17\u201322) to reflect the most recent demand mean. sigma_hat left as default so backend computes volatility over full history scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances higher short-run demand forecast with conservative uncertainty handling given past delays and high variance.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-22 (Period 24). History shows consistent concluded arrivals with lead_time=4; on-hand=1146, in-transit=645 (large pipeline but many prior arrivals confirm 4-period regime). Recent demand (Periods 18\u201323) is elevated and volatile (demands: 419,439,301,232,238,212; mean\u2248306.8). I set L to calculate (use observed lead times) to reflect confirmed 4-period actual lead time. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=6 to capture the elevated recent demand regime and higher variance so the OR engine will size base stock to cover (1+L) periods under the current demand regime while acknowledging holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained actual lead_time=4 from concluded arrivals through Period 23 (evidence: multiple orders placed Period1\u201319 arrived with lead_time=4). Recent demand regime elevated: Periods18\u201323 mean \u2248306.8 (demands: 419,439,301,232,238,212) with high variance.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29 (Period 25). Inventory strong: on-hand=1231, in-transit=353. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead_time=4 (multiple orders placed in Periods 1\u201320 concluded with W=4). Recent demand elevated and volatile vs earlier baseline; use a recent-window forecast to capture the current regime. Keep L at promised (4) since concluded history confirms a 4-period regime and backend expects promised lead time. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat from a recent_N window (N=6) to reflect the elevated, high-variance demand seen in the last 6 periods; this keeps base-stock responsive while the large on-hand plus in-transit provides cushion against pipeline uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained actual lead_time=4 (many concluded arrivals show W=4); recent demand regime elevated and volatile \u2014 recent 6-period demand (Periods19\u201324) shows elevated mean with high variance; large outstanding pipeline/in-transit but current on-hand is high (1231).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). Historical conclues consistently confirm actual lead_time=4; pipeline small (in-transit=137) and on-hand is high (1293). Recent demand has moderated vs earlier spikes; use a short recent window to reflect the latest lower demand and avoid excess ordering given large on-hand. Choose L=default to keep promised 4; mu_hat use recent_N with N=6 to capture most recent demand regime; sigma_hat default to let backend scale volatility over (1+L). This combination prevents over-ordering while preserving service under confirmed L=4.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained actual lead_time=4 from multiple concluded arrivals through Period 25; recent demand regime has moderated vs earlier spikes; current on-hand is high (1293) with small in-transit (137) \u2014 deprioritize new orders until inventory normalizes.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:

Use recent_N for mu_hat (N=5) to reflect the recent demand regime used by the backend while keeping orders restrained given high on-hand.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/19 (Period 28). Actual lead_time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history; current on-hand is high (1208) and in-transit=0. Recent demand regime should be estimated from the most recent periods to reflect elevated/volatile demand seen through Periods 22\u201327. Use promised lead time (default) to keep OR engine aligned with supplier contract while using a recent-window demand forecast to capture regime shifts; keep sigma as default to let backend scale volatility with chosen L.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained actual lead_time=4 from multiple concluded arrivals (orders placed Period1\u201323 arriving with W=4). Recent demand regime elevated/volatile (Periods 22\u201327 show lower but variable demand; maintain recent-window forecasting).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=1050, in-transit=0. Historical concludes consistently confirm actual lead_time=4 across many periods. Recent demand regime is elevated and volatile; current on-hand is high so we should deprioritize aggressive replenishment. Set L to promised (default) since concluded history supports LT=4. Use a recent-window for demand (N=6) to capture the elevated/volatile regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend builds a base-stock sized to recent demand patterns while avoiding over-ordering given high on-hand.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained actual lead_time=4 from multiple concluded arrivals; recent demand elevated/volatile; current on-hand high (1050) with in-transit=0 \u2014 deprioritize new orders until inventory normalizes.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02): historical concludes consistently show actual lead_time=4. Current on-hand is high (910) and in-transit=0 after recent arrivals; demand regime has been elevated and volatile historically but recent periods show moderate demands. To avoid over-ordering while respecting the 4-period lead time, use promised/default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across samples. This conservative choice deprioritizes aggressive replenishment until on-hand normalizes or new conclude messages indicate pipeline changes.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/9 (Period 31). Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead_time = 4. Current inventory: on-hand=765, in-transit=503 (large pipeline but many units already outstanding). Recent demand has moderated vs earlier spikes; last 6 observed demands (Periods 25\u201330) show a lower recent mean and still noticeable variance. Given sustained actual L=4 and elevated on-hand, use a recent-window demand forecast to reflect the moderated regime while avoiding aggressive replenishment that increases holding cost. Choose recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand regime; keep L as default (promised lead time = 4) because concluded arrivals confirm the 4-period regime and backend expects promised L.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained actual lead_time=4 from multiple concluded arrivals through Period 30; recent demand regime moderated vs earlier spikes\u2014use recent-window forecasting; current on-hand high (765) with substantial in-transit (503) \u2192 deprioritize aggressive new orders until inventory normalizes.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/16 (Period 32). Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead_time=4 (multiple orders with W=4 across periods). Current on-hand=624 and in-transit=503 (large pipeline). Recent demand regime elevated but has moderated in latest periods; use a recent-window demand estimate to avoid over-ordering while pipeline clears. Choose promised lead time (default) since concluded history confirms L=4 and backend expects promised L. Use recent_N for mu_hat (N=6) to capture the most recent demand regime without over-weighting earlier spikes. Use default sigma_hat to let backend apply overall sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). These settings bias ordering down (relative to long-run mean) while on-hand+pipeline is high, reducing holding cost risk given holding=$1 and profit=$2.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained actual lead_time=4 from multiple concluded arrivals; recent demand regime elevated but has moderated in latest 6 periods; current inventory high (on-hand=624, in-transit=503) \u2014 deprioritize aggressive new orders until pipeline depletes.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). Recent demand has moderated vs earlier spikes: last 6 demands (Periods 27-32) = [120,158,140,145,141,135], mean \u2248139.8. On-hand=489, in-transit=503 (total pipeline ~992) \u2014 ample coverage versus (1+L)-period demand; confirmed actual lead_time=4 historically. Choose L default (promised=4) since concluded history repeatedly shows LT=4. Use mu_hat recent_N with N=6 to anchor the (1+L) demand forecast to the latest moderated regime. Use sigma_hat recent_N N=6 to capture current volatility rather than longer-horizon variance which was inflated by earlier spikes. These settings bias the OR backend toward lower replenishment given high on-hand + in-transit, reducing holding cost while maintaining service for the current lower-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained actual lead_time=4 from multiple concluded arrivals; recent demand regime has moderated (Periods27\u201332 mean \u2248140) and current inventory is elevated (on-hand=489, in-transit=503) \u2014 deprioritize aggressive new orders until pipeline depletes.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/30 (Period 34). Historical concludes consistently show actual lead_time=4 \u2014 use promised/default to reflect the sustained regime. Recent demand has moderated vs earlier spikes: last 6 periods (Periods 28\u201333) demand = [158,140,145,141,135,147], mean \u2248144.7 and lower variance than spike periods. Current inventory: on-hand=342, in-transit=503 -> sizable pipeline; avoid inflating forecast with older high-demand regimes. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat from a recent 6-period window to capture the moderated regime and reduce ordering aggressiveness while pipeline depletes.

Carry-over insight: Sustained actual lead_time=4 confirmed by multiple concluded arrivals; recent demand regime has moderated (Periods 28\u201333 mean \u2248144.7); current inventory elevated pipeline (in-transit=503) and on-hand=342 \u2014 deprioritize aggressive new orders until pipeline depletes.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07). Historical concludes consistently confirm actual lead_time=4. Recent demand has moderated vs earlier spikes; last 6 realized demands (Periods 29\u201334) = [140,145,141,135,147,106], recent mean \u2248135.7 with modest variance. Current on-hand=739 and in-transit=0 \u2014 inventory is high relative to recent demand, so deprioritize aggressive ordering. Set L to promised/default (4) consistent with concluded history; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent_N=6 window to make the OR engine use the most recent, lower-demand regime and thus reduce recommended order quantities to avoid excess holding cost while maintaining service.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained actual lead_time=4 from multiple concluded arrivals; recent demand regime has moderated (Periods29\u201334 mean \u2248135.7); current inventory elevated (on-hand=739, in-transit=0) \u2014 deprioritize new orders until pipeline depletes.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). Historical concluded arrivals confirm sustained actual lead_time=4; current inventory: on-hand=654, in-transit=0. Recent demand has moderated \u2014 last 6 periods (Periods 30\u201335) demands = [145,141,135,147,106,85], mean \u2248126.5 and lower variance versus earlier spikes. To avoid excess holding cost given high on-hand and zero pipeline, keep lead time at promised (use default) and set demand forecast using a recent-window (6-period) average; estimate volatility from the same recent window. This reduces new orders until pipeline rebuilds and balances service level vs holding cost.

Carry-over insight: New: Current on-hand high (654) with in-transit=0 (Period36) \u2014 deprioritize aggressive new orders until pipeline replenishment and demand-confirmation.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). Historical concluded arrivals show a stable actual lead_time=4; recent demand has moderated (Periods 31-36 mean \u2248116 units). Current inventory is high (on-hand=570, in-transit=3) so we should deprioritize aggressive ordering. Set L by calculating observed lead times (captures confirmed W=4). Forecast demand across review+lead with a recent-window (N=6) to reflect the moderated recent regime and avoid inflating orders from earlier high-variance periods. Use recent-window volatility (N=6) so safety stock reflects current variability, keeping orders small while pipeline depletes.

Carry-over insight: New: Inventory remains elevated but pipeline negligible (on-hand=570, in-transit=3 at Period 37) \u2014 deprioritize new orders until pipeline depletes and recent demand confirms sustained shift.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/10/28 (Period 38). Recent demand regime has moderated vs mid-year spikes; last 6 demands (Periods 32\u201337) are [135,147,106,85,84,109] => lower/less volatile. Actual lead_time has been consistently 4 periods in concluded history. Current inventory: on-hand=461, in-transit=40 \u2014 substantial coverage vs recent demand. To avoid excess holding cost while preserving service, use promised/default lead time (4) and base forecasts on a recent-window (6 periods) to reflect the moderated regime. Use recent_N for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Sustained actual lead_time=4 confirmed across many concluded arrivals; recent demand regime has moderated (Periods32\u201337 mean \u2248111) and pipeline is small while on-hand remains elevated \u2014 deprioritize aggressive new orders until pipeline depletes and demand confirms sustained shift.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead_time=4; promised L=4 is validated. Recent demand has moderated \u2014 last 6 concluded demands (Periods 34\u201339) = [106,85,84,109,78,61], mean \u224887 and lower variance vs earlier spikes. Current inventory: on-hand=322, in-transit=150 (moderate pipeline). To avoid excess holding cost while maintaining service, keep L at the validated promised value and use a recent-window demand estimate (6-period) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets stock for the current lower-demand regime and reduces aggressive replenishment.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained actual lead_time=4 from concluded arrivals; recent demand has moderated (Periods34\u201339 mean \u224887); current inventory moderate (on-hand=322, in-transit=150) \u2014 deprioritize aggressive new orders until pipeline depletes or demand rises.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). Historical conclude messages consistently confirm actual lead_time = 4. Recent demand regime has moderated from earlier spikes; latest demand history (Periods 34\u201340) shows lower/variable weekly demand (~85\u2013145). Current inventory: on-hand=256, in-transit=147 \u2014 modest pipeline. Given sustained L=4 and a recent moderated demand regime, use a short recent window to forecast (captures current lower demand and recent variability) and match sigma to same window so OR backend sizes buffer appropriately while avoiding excess holdings.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). Historical concludes strongly confirm sustained actual lead_time=4; recent demand regime has moderated vs earlier spikes so use a short recent window. Current visible inventory = on-hand 226 + in-transit 128 = 354 units (adequate near-term cover). Set L to default (promised=4) to match evidence and OR expectations. Use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the latest demand mean/variance while avoiding older high-volatility spikes. This down-weights older elevated-demand periods and prevents over-ordering given elevated on-hand + modest pipeline.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). Confirmed sustained actual lead_time=4 from many concluded arrivals; current inventory on-hand=196, in-transit=102 (pipeline small). Recent demand has moderated \u2014 last 6 concluded demands (Periods 37\u201342) = [109,78,61,69,67,109], mean \u224882.2 with moderate variance. To avoid over-ordering given elevated historical pipeline now reduced, set L by calculating observed lead times (captures confirmed W=4). Use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets (1+L)\xd7recent mean and volatility that reflect the moderated demand regime, avoiding excess holding cost while maintaining service. This also responds to prior shipment-delay risk by relying on concluded lead-time evidence rather than promised-only assumptions.

Carry-over insight: New: Pipeline materially reduced (in-transit=102) and on-hand moderate (196) at Period 43 \u2014 deprioritize aggressive new orders until pipeline depletes or demand increases.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09 (Period 44). Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead_time=4. Recent demand regime has moderated versus earlier spikes; use a short recent window to capture current mean/volatility. Current inventory: on-hand=166, in-transit=189 (total pipeline+on-hand=355) \u2014 moderate but not high, so avoid overshooting orders. Set L to promised (4) to match confirmed regime; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=6) to focus the forecast on the most recent demand regime and volatility, which balances service level against holding cost given current moderate inventory and ongoing past pipeline variability.

=== Period 45 Summary ===
610776002: ordered=37, arrived=18 units (ordered on Period 41, lead_time was 4 periods), starting on-hand inventory=129, demand=64, sold=64, ending on-hand inventory=65

Daily Reward (R_t): $63.00

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019-12-23). History shows sustained actual lead_time=4 from many concluded arrivals; current on-hand=65, in-transit=242. Recent demand has moderated; using a 6-period recent window to adapt forecast for the review+lead period while honoring promised lead time. Choose L=default to reflect the promised/confirmed 4-period regime; mu_hat=recent_N (N=6) to capture recent demand level; sigma_hat=default to use full-sample volatility scaled for (1+L). This prioritizes service (given available pipeline) while avoiding excessive ordering into an already-evidenced 4-period lead-time pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $158.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30 (Period 47). Historical concludes consistently show actual lead_time=4; pipeline=373 and on-hand=26 (low). Recent demand (Periods 41-46) is moderate (~67,109,61,55,64,92) \u2014 use a short recent window to capture current regime. Keep L at promised/confirmed 4 so arrivals align with observed behavior. Set mu_hat using recent_N (N=6) to reflect the last 6 periods' demand and avoid overreacting to earlier spikes. Use default sigma_hat (population std scaled by sqrt(1+L)) so backend uses full sample volatility while respecting the chosen lead time. This balances service level (protect against near-term stockout given low on-hand + pipeline) against holding cost (avoid ordering to rebuild to spike-era highs).

Carry-over insight: New: Period47 on-hand is very low (26) while in-transit=373 \u2014 pipeline should cover next cycles but monitor arrivals; treat as medium stockout risk until arrivals conclude.
