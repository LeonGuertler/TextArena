Demand signal: recent observations show an upward tick (308 last period) but sample size is small; calendar (2019-02-11) has no strong apparel spike. Decision logic: with zero inventory and a 4-period promised lead time (so we must cover 5 periods of demand), the OR baseline already balances expected 5-period demand (\u03bc\u0302=1024) and safety stock under cost ratio. No concrete evidence to distrust promised lead time or to believe shipments are lost, and the last-period spike is insufficient to justify materially exceeding OR's capped order (which already prevents extreme swings).

Step 2 \u2014 Demand assessment: historical mean = 204.8 (samples [148,175,160,233,308]). Period 1 realized demand = 266, which is materially above the historical mean and indicates possible upward demand pressure. Variability (sample std \u224864.6) plus recent high draws (233,308,266) suggests higher short-term risk of stockouts if we under-order. Step 3 \u2014 OR baseline: OR recommended 321 units (capped base-stock logic). Recomputing yields a similar cap (~311) but OR's 321 is already above that. Given elevated realized demand and the fact that the pipeline might still be delayed or at risk, I modestly increase the order to provide extra safety stock for the next (L+1)=5 periods of exposure.
