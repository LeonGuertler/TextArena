OR cap-based recommendation is 345 units (OR uses promised L=4 and historical stats). Lead-time inference: No concluded arrivals yet (Period 1 and 2 conclude show arrived=0 for prior orders) \u2014 this is expected given promised L=4, so there is no confirmed evidence of lost shipments or a shorter/longer actual lead time. Inventory math: In-transit 635 vs expected 5-period demand 1024 leaves a shortfall \u2248389 units. OR's base-stock logic would produce order_raw \u2248453 and its cap \u2248314\u2013314 (cap calculation gives \u2248314), which explains OR recommending a sizable top-up; OR's final recommendation (345) is slightly above the calculated cap but consistent with needing to cover the pipeline shortfall. Decision: Follow OR recommendation of 345 units. Rationale: the pipeline shortfall (~389) justifies a large replenishment; no concluded arrivals yet to indicate lost shipments or lead-time anomalies that would call for a defensive reduction or a much larger emergency order. Ordering 345 balances the estimated 5-period demand coverage while respecting OR's cap logic and avoids excessive holding cost given holding=$1/unit/period and moderate profit.
