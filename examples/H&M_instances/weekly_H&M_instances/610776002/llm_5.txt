  "rationale": "a) World knowledge & product: SKU is a women's lightweight jersey T-shirt in early Feb (2019-02-11). No major sustained seasonal spike this week aside from Valentine\u2019s Day (2/14) which may give a small short-term uplift in apparel but not a structural change. b) Demand regime: Historical unified samples for 610776002 = [148,175,160,233,308], mean \u2248 205 units/period. No evidence yet of a regime shift. c) Lead time & missing orders: Supplier promised lead time = 4 periods. There are no prior orders or concluded arrivals to infer a different actual lead time; treat actual lead time as unknown but plan for the promised 4-period lead time. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, In-transit=0. With lead time L=4, we must cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand when ordering now because current period demand occurs after decision. e) Final order logic: Use historical mean demand \u2248205 units/period as forecast. Target pipeline = 5 * 205 = 1,025 units. Subtract on-hand and in-transit (0), so place order for 1,025 units. This balances service level (avoid stockouts across the 5-period window) against holding cost given limited evidence of lower demand.",
