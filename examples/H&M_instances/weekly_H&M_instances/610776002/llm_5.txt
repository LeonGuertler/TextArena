Decision logic: with promised L=2, order + on-hand + in-transit should cover L+1=3 periods of demand (current period plus next two). Given no pipeline and unavoidable stockouts for current and next period (arrivals only occur in Period 3), place an order to cover three periods at the historical mean demand (205 units/period) to be ready when shipment arrives. This balances service and holding given profit=$2/unit and holding=$1/unit/period (we keep order to the expected demand, not an inflated safety buffer).",
