Given reliable arrivals historically and to provide minimal safety stock, order a small round-up to cover the shortfall while avoiding excessive holding cost.",

{
  "rationale": "World/calendar: Period 47 is 2019-12-30 (year-end/holiday week) \u2014 demand can dip but recent data already reflects seasonal effects. Demand regime analysis: recent periods 36\u201346 demands average \u224877 units/period (sum 849 over 11 periods) \u2014 sustained lower-demand regime continues.

Inventory & pipeline: on-hand=23, in-transit=285 (these in-transit units were ordered in Periods 43\u201346 and will arrive across Periods 47\u201350), so on-hand + in-transit = 308 available to serve Periods 47\u201350.
