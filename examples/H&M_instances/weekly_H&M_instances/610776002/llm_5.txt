Historical & regime: Recent sustained low-demand regime since Period 30 (avg \u2248108 units/period) \u2014 demand in P30\u2013P46 remains low (many weeks 60\u2013150). Lead time & arrivals: Supplier lead time has been variable/unstable historically (confirmed in prior carry-overs). Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0 but in-transit=1716 units \u2014 at expected demand \u2248100\u2013110/week this pipeline covers ~15\u201317 periods if it arrives. Risk tradeoff: Holding cost $1/unit/period vs profit $4/unit \u2014 with a large pipeline and uncertain lead times, additional ordering now risks unnecessary holding cost when demand is low and current in-transit supply is ample. Action: place no new order this period and consume pipeline arrivals over coming periods.",
