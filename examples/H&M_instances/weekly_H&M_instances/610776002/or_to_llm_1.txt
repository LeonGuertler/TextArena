Use recent observed demand rather than OR's long-run baseline. Recent demand has dropped substantially (Periods 32\u201337 demands = 135,147,106,85,84,109 \u2192 avg \u2248111), well below the historical high. Current on-hand 713 + in-transit 18 = 731 units covers ~6.58 periods at 111/unit or ~4.35 periods at 168/unit (earlier 21\u201331 avg). OR recommended 481 based on higher historical mean and promised lead time; that would create excess holding given low current demand and high per-period holding cost. To be conservative but avoid a stockout if demand rebounds modestly, order enough to bring pipeline+on-hand up to ~5 periods at a middle-ground demand estimate. Using a cautious estimate between the recent low (111) and the earlier drop-average (168), I choose to top up to cover \u22485 periods at ~146 units/period (midpoint): 5\xd7146=730 target. Current total 731 already meets that, so no order is strictly necessary. However, to allow for some arrival uncertainty and fractional rounding if using the higher 168 estimate (5\xd7168=840 target), place a small safety order of 110 units to cover the possible gap without incurring excessive holding cost.
