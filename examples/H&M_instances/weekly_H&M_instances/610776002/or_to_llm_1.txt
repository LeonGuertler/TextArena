{
  "rationale": "Observations: on-hand=132, in-transit=1690 but earlier carry-over notes (Period 9) indicate specific delayed shipments remain unreliable; recent realized demand has been in a lower regime (Periods 25\u201346 mostly 55\u2013150, recent weeks ~60\u2013110). Profit=$4, holding=$1 \u2192 critical fractile q=0.8 (z\u22480.84). With promised lead time L=2, (L+1)=3 periods of demand must be covered. Using recent realized demand ~90 units/week (conservative midpoint of recent lower regime), three-period demand \u2248270 units. Current reliable on-hand is 132; trusting the large in-transit would risk accepting delayed/lost shipments. Therefore order enough to raise reliable coverage toward 3-period demand but avoid heavy overstock given holding cost and uncertainty. I choose to order 150 units (132 + 150 = 282 on-hand+incoming reliable), which covers ~3.1 weeks at 90/week while limiting holding cost and exposure to possibly lost pipeline. I follow OR's conservative 0 suggestion only partially \u2014 I override with a modest replenishment because OR cannot see lost/delayed shipments and treats in-transit as reliable, whereas experience shows pipeline unreliability. Decision notes: monitor next conclude messages to confirm which in-transit arrive; if many in-transit conclude soon, reduce future orders sharply.",
