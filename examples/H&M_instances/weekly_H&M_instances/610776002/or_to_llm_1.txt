Decision logic: OR is heavily capped and therefore may under-order given the large 5-period demand exposure and the observed high Period1 demand=266 (above historical mean) plus the fact that the only pipeline (314) covers well under one period. With promised lead time 4, we must cover demand for 5 periods; a conservative increase over OR is warranted to reduce risk of stockouts if shipments are delayed or demand stays elevated. Tradeoff: holding cost is $1/unit/period vs profit $2/unit, so increasing moderately is preferable to risking lost sales.

However, actual recent realized demand is much higher: Period1 demand=266, Period2 demand=316 (recent 2-period mean=291 u/period), indicating a likely regime shift upward. The OR baseline uses promised lead time and historical mean and may under-order under this spike. Risks: orders currently in-transit have not concluded yet (no concluded arrivals); they may still arrive but cannot be sped up. Action decision: increase order above OR recommendation to reduce stockout risk while accepting additional holding cost. Calculation summary informing action: if elevated demand ~290 u/period, 5-period need \u22481450; pipeline 714 \u2192 incremental need \u2248736. Full replacement of that amount risks large holding; compromise chosen to balance shortage risk and holding cost.
