Lead time: supplier promised 0 but no concluded arrivals yet; actual lead time unknown \u2014 treat as possibly \u22650 and plan to cover current period demand because orders arrive after decision for same period only if lead time=0 (uncertain). Inventory/pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=0 so no coverage for upcoming demand. Economics: profit $4/unit vs holding $1/unit/period \u2014 good margin, but holding cost encourages not overstocking.
