Because arrivals are only confirmed in conclude messages, we cannot assume in-transit is lost; ordering now risks severe overstock and high holding cost ($1/unit/period) if the in-transit shipment arrives. Profit per unit is $4, so stocking can be profitable, but the in-transit volume (1550) already covers many periods of demand (1550 / ~100 \u2248 15 periods). Decision rule: avoid adding more risk of excess inventory given large in-transit and no confirmed missing shipment; monitor arrivals in subsequent concludes and only order if conclude shows lost/zero arrival. Final action: place no new order this period.",
