Demand prior: historical unified samples for SKU 610776002 = [148,175,160,233,308], mean \u2248 205 units/period; substantial variance with occasional spikes (308). Lead time & pipeline: supplier promised LT=4 periods; no concluded arrivals yet so actual LT is unknown and could be \u22654 or orders may be lost. Inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Decision logic: because arrivals occur only after the promised LT, any order placed now will not be available to meet demand for the next 4 periods; we cannot rely on early/shorter delivery without evidence. Holding cost is high ($1/unit/period) relative to profit ($2/unit), so over-ordering to cover many periods would create large holding penalties if demand doesn\u2019t materialize. To balance service and risk, place a moderate initial test shipment to seed future availability when/if it arrives while avoiding excessive holding cost in case of lost/late shipments. This order size also gives a traceable arrival to infer actual lead time when (and if) it concludes. Final order: 200 units (moderate, below mean period demand but limits holding exposure).",
