Supplier promised lead_time=0 but actual lead_time unknown; until we observe any concluded arrivals treat promised LT=0 but remain alert for delayed/lost shipments. Holding cost is $1/unit/period vs. profit $2/unit, so overstock is costly; better to target expected near-term demand rather than large safety stock.
