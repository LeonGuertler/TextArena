No concluded arrivals exist to infer actual lead time; promised lead time = 0 but actual lead time unknown, so assume shipments may not arrive before demand. On-hand + in-transit = 0, so to meet expected Period 1 demand I order for one-period expected demand rather than risk heavy holding cost. Profit $4/unit vs holding $1/unit/period implies positive margin but holding cost is material; avoid overstock. Final order = round(mean demand = 205 units).",
