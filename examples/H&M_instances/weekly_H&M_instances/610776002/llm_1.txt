  "rationale": "World/calendar: Period 46 is 2019-12-23 (just before Christmas) but recent observed demand is in the lower regime (~80 or less per period) since Period 36; no sustained holiday surge is evident in history. Demand analysis: recent demands P42\u2013P45 = [109,61,55,64], avg \u224872 units/period; carry-over insight records a sustained downshift to \u224880 units. Lead time: confirmed 4 periods in history. Inventory/pipeline: on-hand=128, in-transit=310, total = 438 units. Coverage requirement: need to cover L+1 = 5 periods of demand. Forecast 5-period demand \u2248 5 \xd7 75 = 375 units (conservative ~75). Decision: pipeline + on-hand (438) already exceed 5-period expected demand, so place no order to avoid holding costs and excess inventory.",
