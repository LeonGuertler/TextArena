SIMPLE LLM->OR STRATEGY (LLM as Demand Forecaster)
======================================================================


Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
(1) Historical pattern summary: five-period history = [148, 175, 160, 233, 308]; overall recent rise with volatility. (2) Seasonal/calendar considerations: current date 2019-02-11 (late winter) \u2014 lightweight women's T-shirt demand typically lower in winter and rises into spring/summer; no major retail holiday at this date to boost demand. (3) Recent trend analysis: last three periods show a sustained upward move (160 -> 233 -> 308), recent 3-period average = 233.7, overall mean = 204.8; recent momentum suggests continued higher demand but tempered by winter seasonality. (4) Final forecast logic: blend recent momentum with seasonal tempering (weight recent average ~70%, overall mean ~30%) -> forecast \u2248 round(0.7*233.7 + 0.3*204.8) \u2248 290.

Carry-over insight: Upward trend starting Period 3: Periods 3-5 avg = 233.7 vs Periods 1-2 avg = 161.5 (+44.6%), sustained increase across 3 consecutive periods.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
(1) Historical summary: training demands = [148,175,160,233,308] show an upward regime from Period 3 (avg Periods3-5 = 233.7 vs Periods1-2 = 161.5). (2) Calendar/product: 2019/2/18 (late winter) \u2014 lightweight women's T-shirt may begin rising toward spring but no major holiday effect this week. (3) Recent trend: observed Period1 (test) = 266, above recent training mean (233.7) and below the training max (308) \u2014 supports continuation of the established upward regime. (4) Forecast logic: weigh latest observation (266) and recent training mean (233.7) with bias toward the upward regime; produce a conservative uplift from the recent observation.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
1) Historical pattern summary: Training data shows an upward regime beginning at period 3 (training periods 3-5 avg 233.7 vs periods 1-2 avg 161.5, +44.6%). 2) Calendar: Current date 2019-02-25 is late February; mild seasonal shift toward spring may increase demand for a lightweight women's T-shirt. 3) Recent trend: Test-phase observed demands are 266 (P1) and 316 (P2), a +18.8% increase week-over-week, consistent with an ongoing upward regime. 4) Forecast logic: Use recent absolute increases informed by training-period increases (training increments ~+73 and +75, avg ~+74) and apply conservatively to latest observed 316 => 316 + 74 = 390. Predicted demand set to nearest integer.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
(1) Historical pattern summary: Training series showed rising mean in later training periods (Periods 3-5 avg = 233.7). (2) Seasonal/calendar: Current date 2019-03-04 \u2014 late winter/early spring; T-shirt demand may begin to rise slightly but no major holiday effect. (3) Recent trend analysis: Test-period observations are 266, 316, 306 (avg = 296), showing a sustained higher regime vs recent training avg (Periods training 3-5 avg = 233.7), a ~26.8% increase. Short-term momentum is slightly down from 316 to 306 but remains near 300. (4) Final forecast logic: rely on recent 3-period average with slight regression toward stability given small downward tick -> forecast = 300.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting test Period 1 (2019-02-11 to 2019-02-25): avg increased from 233.7 (training Periods 3-5) to 296 (test Periods 1-3), +26.8%, sustained over 3 periods.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
(1) Historical pattern summary: Training demand series shows rise in later training periods (periods 3-5 avg=233.7) and test periods are substantially higher. (2) Seasonal/calendar: Current date 2019-03-11 has no major retail holidays affecting womens basic T-shirt demand; spring transition could modestly support steady demand. (3) Recent trend analysis: Test periods 1-4 = [266,316,306,283], mean = 292.75; a slight short-term decline from 316->306->283 but overall test level is ~+26.8% vs recent training average (consistent with earlier detected regime shift). (4) Final forecast logic: Base forecast on recent test-period mean while modestly weighting latest observations; produce rounded integer near the 4-period average.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
1) Historical pattern: Training demands show rise from early periods (148,175,160) to later training values (233,308) indicating an upward shift into the training end. Test phase started at a higher level (Periods 1-3 avg ~288) consistent with that shift. 2) Seasonal/calendar: Current date 2019-03-18 is early spring when women's lightweight T-shirts typically maintain steady/moderately increasing demand vs winter. No major retail holiday on this week to spike demand. 3) Recent trend: Test Periods 1-3 were high (266,316,306) then a modest decline in Periods 4-5 (283,252). Decline is recent but not yet a 3+ period sustained downtrend. 4) Forecast logic: blend recent observations with greater weight on the latest 3 periods (306,283,252 avg=280.3) while accounting for seasonal stability. Forecast rounded to an integer: 280.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
(1) Historical summary: Training demands show earlier upward change from early to later training periods, and initial test periods (P1-P3) averaged 296 vs training P3-P5 avg 233.7. (2) Calendar/seasonality: Product is a basic women's T-shirt; late March (2019-03-25) is spring \u2014 modestly positive seasonal demand but no major holiday spikes. (3) Recent trend: Test P1-P3 avg = 296, P4-P6 avg = 268.3 (a modest decline of ~9.3% over the last three periods). Full test P1-P6 avg = 282.2. Recent three-periods are slightly below the longer test mean, indicating a small downward move but no large regime change. (4) Forecast logic: blend recent stability with slight downward momentum; use weighted average toward recent three-period mean while tempering volatility. Final forecast rounded to integer.

(2) Calendar/seasonality: Early April (spring) supports sustained demand for womens T-shirts; no major holiday impact this week. (3) Recent trend: Test recent values show volatility but an overall higher mean \u2014 last 3 periods (P5-7) avg = 295.3, last 4 (P4-7) avg = 277.8; P7 spike to 364 suggests demand uptick but single-period. (4) Forecast logic: blend recent average with slight upward weighting for the P7 spike and spring seasonality => final forecast rounded to nearest unit.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
1) Historical summary: Training demands = [148,175,160,233,308] showed an upward regime starting Period 3 (training) with mean of later periods higher than early ones.

Demand shows elevated regime vs earlier training and mild short-term volatility with a spring uptick in late March/early April. (4) Final forecast logic: weight recent periods more while anchoring to the 6-period average; choose a rounded integer near the recent 3-period average but slightly conservative given volatility => predicted demand 312.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
(1) Historical pattern summary: Training shows an upward shift evident in earlier carry-over notes; test period 1-11 mean = 320.0 with volatility and several spikes (periods 7-8 and period 11). (2) Seasonal/calendar considerations: Current date 2019-04-29 moving into late spring \u2014 T-shirt demand typically rises heading into warmer months, supporting higher short-term demand. No major holiday in early May affecting womens basic T-shirts. (3) Recent trend analysis: Last 5 test periods = [364,372,271,310,564], average = 376.2; last 3 = [271,310,564], average = 381.7. Period 11 is a large spike but recent cluster (periods 7-8 and 11) suggests elevated baseline compared to early test periods. (4) Final forecast logic: Weight recent observations more heavily while being conservative about single extreme spikes. Use a short-term average (last 5) adjusted slightly upward for seasonal lift -> forecast = 380.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
(1) Historical pattern summary: Training demands showed upward shift in Periods 3-5 (avg 233.7 vs 161.5). Test phase started higher (Periods 1-6 avg 282.2). (2) Seasonal/calendar considerations: Current date 2019-05-06 is early May \u2014 spring apparel demand (womens T-shirt) is typically steady to rising into late spring/summer. No major holiday in this week to suggest a sharp drop. (3) Recent trend analysis: Periods 7-12 show a sustained higher level (6 periods) with mean 384.2, compared with Periods 1-6 test avg 282.2 (+36%). Last three periods (10-12) average 432.7 driven by a spike at Period 11 (564) but Period 12 remains elevated (424). (4) Final forecast logic: Given a confirmed sustained upward regime since Period 7, seasonal support for higher spring demand, and recent elevated but slightly volatile observations, forecast next period near the recent regime mean, leaning slightly toward the last-three average. Predicted demand = 385.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 7: avg increased from 282.2 (Test Periods 1-6) to 384.2 (Test Periods 7-12), +36.1%; sustained over 6 consecutive periods.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
(1) Historical pattern summary: Training demands showed an upward regime emerging in later training (periods 3-5 avg 233.7 vs 1-2 avg 161.5). Test phase has generally higher levels than training. (2) Seasonal/calendar: Current date 2019-05-13 (spring in Northern Hemisphere) \u2014 T-shirt is seasonally appropriate; no major holiday the week that would explain a sharp, sustained shift. (3) Recent trend analysis: Test periods 7-12 showed a sustained higher regime (periods 7-12 avg ~347) including a one large spike at period 11 (564). Last 6 test periods (8-13) avg = 374; last 3 (11-13) avg = 430 but skewed by period 11. Median of recent 6 is ~343, suggesting central tendency lower than the 3-period mean. No new 3+ period sustained change after period 13. (4) Final forecast logic: weight recent 6-period average while damping the single large spike (period 11). Blend yields a conservative forecast around 370 units.

(2) Calendar/seasonality: current date 2019-05-20 (late spring) \u2014 T-shirt seasonal demand is typically stable-to-increasing into summer; no major holiday week. (3) Recent trend: volatility but recent 3-period avg (Periods 12-14) = 386.3 and 4-period avg (11-14) = 430.8 driven by one large spike (564 at P11); overall recent level is ~380\u2013430.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
(1) Historical summary: Training demands show low-to-mid seasonal baseline (148,175,160,233,308). Test phase shows higher regime from Period 3 onward with sustained elevated volumes (many weeks in 250-560 range). (2) Calendar: Current date 2019-05-27 is late May \u2014 seasonal lift for lightweight women's T-shirts ahead of summer, supporting maintained elevated demand. (3) Recent trend: Last 3 observed periods = 304, 431, 442 (avg 392.3). Prior 6-period regime (P7-12) avg = 384.2; no clear new sustained shift. Volatility from occasional spikes (564 at P11) but recent 3-week average is representative. (4) Forecast logic: Use recent 3-week average weighted for recency and adjust for seasonal summer uptick -> round to nearest unit.

(2) Calendar/seasonality: Current date 2019-06-03 is early summer when women's lightweight jersey T-shirts typically see stable-to-higher demand. No major holiday this week. (3) Recent trend: Last 4 periods (P13-P16) average = 403, showing a sustained higher regime vs earlier test periods. (4) Forecast logic: weight recent periods heavily while dampening one-off spikes (P11). Use recent 4-period average as best estimator adjusted minimally for seasonality \u2192 round to nearest unit.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
(1) Historical pattern: Training demands rose from early periods to later (training avg periods3-5 = 233.7 vs 1-2 =161.5). Test phase shows higher means with volatility: Test P1-12 avg = 311.5; P13-17 = [304,431,442,435,640] avg = 450.4. (2) Calendar: Current date 2019-06-10\u2014start of summer; T-shirt (women's lightweight jersey) is seasonally relevant, supporting higher demand. (3) Recent trend: Strong upward shift since Period 13 with 5 consecutive higher periods and a large spike in P17 (640). Last-3 avg = 505.7, last-5 avg = 450.4. (4) Forecast logic: blend recent momentum and spike sensitivity, weight last-3 more heavily due to recent surge and seasonal lift -> predicted demand = 506.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 13: avg increased from 311.5 (Test Periods 1-12) to 450.4 (Test Periods 13-17), +44.6%; sustained over 5 consecutive periods.

LLM Rationale:
(1) Historical summary: Training demands: [148,175,160,233,308] show upward shift entering test. Test periods show higher mean with notable jumps around Periods 7 and 13. (2) Calendar/seasonality: Current date 2019-06-17 (early summer) supports stronger demand for a womens T-shirt. No single-calendar-event spike expected this week. (3) Recent trend: Periods 13-18 averaged 445.2, last 3 periods (16-18) average 498 with a one large spike at Period 17 (640). Demand remains at a higher regime vs earlier periods. (4) Forecast logic: weight very recent demand while tempering the Period 17 spike. Combine last-3 average (498) and last-6 average (445) with heavier weight on recent (60%/40%) => forecast ~477.

(3) Recent trend: Last 6 periods (P15-P20) = [442,435,640,419,439,301], mean = 446, but high volatility; last 4 mean (P17-P20) = 450 with P17 as an outlier spike and P20 drop to 301. No sustained new regime detected in most recent 3+ periods. (4) Forecast logic: Weight recent performance while smoothing volatility; use the last 4-period mean (reduces single-period noise) rounded to integer.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
(1) Historical summary: Training demands = [148,175,160,233,308]; test periods show higher mean with volatility and several spikes (notably P11=564, P17=640). Overall test mean P1-21 \u2248 375. (2) Calendar: Current date 2019-07-08 \u2014 summer season where T-shirts are generally in demand, but recent weeks show a decline. No major retail events in immediate week to boost demand. (3) Recent trend: last 3 periods = [439,301,232] show a short-term downward movement after a prior high-volatility regime. No sustained new regime (fewer than 3+ periods of consistent shift beyond usual variance). (4) Forecast logic: weight recent observations more heavily but damp spikes \u2014 use a weighted average favoring the most recent period (40% P21, 30% P20, 30% P19) => 315 (rounded).

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
(1) Historical pattern: training showed rising demand (148,175,160,233,308) with mid-period uplift. Test phase had higher baseline with spikes (notably Period 11=564, Period 17=640) and more volatility. (2) Calendar/seasonality: product is a womens T-shirt\u2014summer demand can be strong, but observed July values are lower, suggesting seasonality not producing a spike now. (3) Recent trend: last 3 periods show a clear decline (Period20=301, Period21=232, Period22=238; 3-period avg=257) versus prior periods' higher averages (Periods13-19 avg\u2248444). (4) Forecast logic: weight most recent 3 weeks heavily due to apparent regime change; no strong calendar event on 2019-07-15 to reverse trend. Final forecast set near the recent 3-period average adjusted minimally for noise.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 20: avg decreased from 444.3 (Periods 13-19) to 257.0 (Periods 20-22), -42.1%

(2) Seasonal/calendar: Current date 2019-07-22 \u2014 summer; product is a women's lightweight T-shirt which is typically favorable in summer, but recent data show a post-June decline. No major retail event this week. (3) Recent trend analysis: Periods 19-23 = [439,301,232,238,212] \u2014 sharp decline beginning Period 20. Last 3 periods avg = 227; last 4 avg = 245. Prior higher values appear part of an earlier regime, not sustained. (4) Final forecast logic: Weight recent observations heavily due to clear downward regime since Period 20; use the 3-period recent average with slight smoothing toward 4-period avg => forecast ~230.

(2) Calendar: current date 2019-07-29 (summer) \u2014 T-shirt is seasonal but no major retail event this week. (3) Recent trend: clear downward trend since Period 20 (301) through Period 24 (207); last 3 periods avg = 219, last 5 periods avg = 238, indicating decline stabilizing around ~210\u2013240. (4) Forecast logic: weight recent observations heavily (last 3\u20135 periods) and bias slightly downward given trend; choose a conservative integer near the 3-period average.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
(1) Historical summary: Training mean rising from early periods to later (past demands 148,175,160,233,308) then test shows higher means with volatility and spikes (notably periods 11,17). (2) Calendar/product: Current date 2019-08-05 (Northern Hemisphere summer) \u2014 T-shirt is seasonal summer item, so seasonality could support demand, but observed data shows decline into summer-late July. (3) Recent trend: Significant downward regime established starting Period 20 (Periods 20-25 avg = 224) with six consecutive lower observations and last value 154, indicating continued weakness. (4) Forecast logic: weight recent periods heavily while acknowledging some noise; use recent 6-period average (224) but give greater weight to most recent values (periods 23-25 avg = (212+207+154)/3 = 191) and last period 154, resulting in a conservative near-term forecast around 160.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
1) Historical summary: Training periods showed upward shift early (avg of last 3 training ~233.7). Test phase had high volatility with a sustained high regime in Periods 13-19 (avg 444.3) then a pronounced decline starting Period 20. 2) Calendar/seasonality: Product is a women's lightweight T-shirt (summer relevant). Current date mid-August; seasonality would normally support steady summer demand, not the sharp decline observed. No major retail peak this week. 3) Recent trend: Strong, sustained downward regime from Period 20 through Period 26 (values: 301,232,238,212,207,154,102) \u2014 7 consecutive periods with mean 206.6 and continuing decline to 102 in Period 26. 4) Forecast logic: Given the confirmed regime drop and continued downward momentum over the last 3 weeks (207 -> 154 -> 102), expect demand to remain low near recent levels. I weight most recent observation and short-term trend, projecting a modest further decline/stabilization below the 3-period recent mean (154).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 20 updated: avg decreased from 444.3 (Periods 13-19) to 206.6 (Periods 20-26), -53.5% \u2014 sustained over 7 consecutive periods.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
(1) Historical summary: Training demands [148,175,160,233,308] show an upward move into test where multiple regime shifts occurred: large rise through Periods 1-19 then a clear drop starting Period 20. (2) Calendar/world: Current date 2019-08-19 (late summer) \u2014 product is a women's lightweight T\u2010shirt (summer-relevant), but seasonal tail of summer may start reducing demand toward fall. No major retail events in late Aug to boost demand. (3) Recent trend: Strong decline since Period 19 (peak ~439\u2013640 range) to much lower levels from Period 20 onward. Most recent 7 periods (P21\u2013P27) avg = 126.1; most recent 3 periods (P25\u2013P27) avg = 125.7, with a small uptick P27 (120) vs P26 (102). This indicates a new lower demand regime has been sustained over 7+ periods. (4) Forecast logic: Weight recent periods heavily (7\u2010period and 3\u2010period averages near 126) and account for seasonal modest downward pressure \u2014 choose a rounded near-term forecast of 126 units.

(2) Calendar/seasonality: Late August (summer) for a women's lightweight T-shirt typically low-to-moderate demand; no major holiday on 2019-08-26. (3) Recent trend: Periods 26-28 = 102, 120, 158 \u2014 short-term recovery after a sustained decline from Periods 20-26. Last-3 average = 126.7 and recent week-over-week increases of +18 and +38 (avg +28).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM Demand Forecast:

LLM Rationale:
(1) Historical summary: Training demands = [148,175,160,233,308] showed an upward shift into the test period. Test periods 1-29 show volatility with highs ~640 and sustained drop starting Period 20. (2) Calendar/calendar effects: Current date 2019-09-02 (late summer \u2192 early fall) for a womens basic T-shirt suggests seasonally lower demand after peak summer promotions; no immediate holiday spikes. (3) Recent trend: Periods 20-29 show a clear downshift: values = [301,232,238,212,207,154,102,120,158,140]; last 3 = 120,158,140 (avg=139), last 5 avg=135.

LLM Rationale:

(2) Calendar: Current date 2019-09-09 (early September) \u2014 end of summer; product is a lightweight women's T-shirt so summer drives higher demand, but summer is ending which supports lower demand. (3) Recent trend: Periods 25-30 = [154,102,120,158,140,145], recent 6-period average = 136.5; last 6 periods show a sustained low regime vs earlier test periods. (4) Forecast logic: weight recent observations heavily given a confirmed lower regime since Period 20; use the 6-period recent average rounded to nearest integer.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
(1) Historical summary: Training demands = [148,175,160,233,308]; test history shows a peak era (Periods 7-19) then a clear decline from Period 20 onward. (2) Calendar/seasonality: Current date 2019-09-16 (early autumn) typically reduces lightweight women's T-shirt demand vs summer. No major retail holidays this week to boost demand. (3) Recent trend: Strong downward regime from Period 20; most recent six periods (26-31): [102,120,158,140,145,141] average = 134.3, last 3-period average (29-31) = 142.0 indicating stabilization around low-140s. (4) Forecast logic: weight most recent stabilization (last 3 periods) and seasonal decline \u2014 predict next period close to recent 3-period average.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26: avg decreased from 206.6 (Periods 20-26) to 134.3 (Periods 26-31), -35.0%; sustained over 6 consecutive periods.

(2) Calendar/seasonal: Current date 2019-09-23 (early autumn) \u2014 lightweight women's T-shirt demand typically declines after summer. No major retail spikes this week. (3) Recent trend: Periods 26-32 show a stable low regime (102,120,158,140,145,141,135) with 26-31 avg \u2248134.3 and Period 32 at 135 \u2014 no reversal signal. (4) Forecast logic: weight recent 7-week average heavily and account for slight week-to-week noise; expect continuation of the low post-summer regime. Predicted demand = 132 (rounded integer).

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
(1) Historical pattern summary: Training demands: [148,175,160,233,308] show an upward shift into test where peaks reached 600s then declined. Test recent history shows a sharp fall from mid-year highs to low-100s in late summer. (2) Seasonal/calendar considerations: Current date 2019-09-30 (early autumn) \u2014 T-shirt (everyday basics) typically has lower demand as summer ends; no major retail event this week to boost demand. (3) Recent trend analysis: Periods 26-33 = [102,120,158,140,145,141,135,147], 8-period avg \u2248136, last 4-period avg \u2248142 \u2014 stable around mid-130s with slight recovery from the low in Period 26. (4) Final forecast logic: weight recent observations heavier (last 4 periods) but anchor to 8-period average; project a near-term stable demand around 140. Predicted next-period demand set to 142.

Product is a lightweight women's T-shirt (less seasonal uplift expected going into autumn). No major retail event in early October that would raise short-term demand. 3) Recent trend: Periods 26-34 average = 132.7; last three periods (32-34) averaged ~129.3 \u2014 recent stability at a lower level. 4) Forecast logic: weight recent 9-period average with slight downward seasonal pressure; produce a near-term forecast close to recent mean.

Test series shows high mid-year volatility with a clear sustained decline starting around Period 26. (2) Calendar/seasonal: Current date 2019-10-14 (early autumn) \u2014 T-shirt (everyday basics) typically sees lower demand moving into autumn; no major retail spike this week. (3) Recent trend: Periods 26-35 average = 127.9; last 5 periods average = 122.8; last 3 average = 112.7 \u2014 a small downward drift, most recent Period 35 = 85 indicates continued softness. (4) Forecast logic: weight recent observations more heavily and allow slight reversion toward the 10-period mean; produce a conservative near-term forecast reflecting the downward trend.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
(1) Historical pattern: Training demands [148,175,160,233,308] show upward movement into test where demands peaked mid-year then collapsed. (2) Calendar/world: Current date 2019-10-21 (autumn in Northern Hemisphere) typically lowers demand for lightweight women's T-shirts vs summer; no major retail holiday spike in late Oct before Black Friday. (3) Recent trend: Large regime decline since Period 20; Periods 26-36 average = 123.9, with the last 3 periods (34-36) averaging 91.7 and last two at 85 and 84 indicating continued low demand. (4) Forecast logic: weight recent observations heavily (most recent weeks), adjust slightly toward short-run mean; predict near the most recent level (84) with small smoothing.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime update at Period 26: avg decreased from 206.6 (Periods 20-26) to 123.9 (Periods 26-36), -40.1%; sustained over 11 consecutive periods.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM Demand Forecast:

(2) Calendar: Current date 2019-10-28 is late October \u2014 autumn in Northern Hemisphere where lightweight T-shirt demand typically falls before winter, so no seasonal uplift expected. (3) Recent trend: Last 7 periods (Periods 31-37) average = 115.3; last 3 periods average = 92.7 with a small bounce from 84->109, but no sustained reversal. (4) Forecast logic: Use recent 7-period average to reflect the new low-demand regime while acknowledging modest uptick; round to nearest integer.

LLM Rationale:
(1) Historical summary: Training demands [148,175,160,233,308] show an upward move into test where demand peaked mid-year then declined sharply from Period 20 onward. (2) Seasonal/calendar: Current date 2019-11-11 (early Nov) typically reduces demand for lightweight women's T-shirts ahead of colder months; no major retail event boosting this SKU this week. (3) Recent trend: Strong downward regime since summer; last 5 observed periods (35-39) = [85,84,109,78,61], mean = 83.4 and declining, last week = 61. (4) Forecast logic: weight very recent weeks heavily due to confirmed downshift; use recent mean trending downward and last observation to produce a conservative near-term forecast slightly above last week to account for noise.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
(1) Historical pattern: training mean rose from early periods then test data shows a large mid-year decline; recent periods (35-41) average ~79 units after a sustained downshift beginning at Period 35. (2) Calendar/calendar: current date 2019-11-25 is the week of Black Friday \u2014 minor uplift possible for apparel but no clear signal in recent data. (3) Recent trend: last 7 periods (35-41) average = 79.0 with low volatility and no sustained rebound. (4) Forecast logic: base forecast on recent mean, modestly conservative around potential small promotional uplift; round to integer.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
(1) Historical pattern summary: Training demands = [148,175,160,233,308]. Test series shows large earlier regime shifts and a clear downshift starting around Period 20, stabilizing at low weekly demand in Periods 35-41 (mean ~86). (2) Seasonal/calendar considerations: Current date 2019-12-02 \u2014 start of December/holiday season can lift apparel demand modestly, but no strong evidence in series for a sustained December spike. (3) Recent trend analysis: Last 6 test periods (Periods 37-42) = [109,78,61,69,67,109], mean \u2248 82; a single uptick at Period 42 (109) but not yet a sustained change (needs 3+ periods). (4) Final forecast logic: Use recent mean with slight positive holiday adjustment, but remain conservative given lack of sustained reversal. Predicted demand rounded to integer.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
(1) Historical summary: Training: [148,175,160,233,308] shows rising then variability. Test phase shows large regime shifts earlier and a pronounced decline since Period 20, stabilizing at low levels from Period 34 onward. (2) Calendar/calendar knowledge: Current date 2019-12-09 \u2014 early December can bring modest uplift for apparel, but this is a lightweight womens T-shirt (seasonally less favored in winter), so little calendar-driven increase expected. (3) Recent trend: Periods 40-43 = [69,67,109,61], 4-period average = 76.5; median = 68; no sustained reversal evident. (4) Forecast logic: emphasize most recent observations with small smoothing toward the 4-period average; no new regime detected. Final forecast rounded to integer.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
(1) Historical summary: training mean growth from early periods then large mid-year peaks and a clear downward regime from Period 20 onward; recent test data show steep decline from summer highs to low values in Oct\u2013Dec (Periods 35\u201344 mostly 55\u2013109). (2) Calendar/calendar knowledge: current date 2019-12-16 (pre-Christmas) \u2014 basics T-shirt typically not seasonally strong in mid-December; occasional promo/Black Friday spikes observed (Period 42 = 109). (3) Recent trend: last three periods = [109, 61, 55]; last two periods average 58 and recent trajectory is flat-to-slight-down after the promo spike. (4) Forecast logic: down-trend regime established over many periods; ignore isolated promo spike and weight most recent observations more. Final forecast = round(average of last two non-spike periods) => 58.

(2) Seasonal/calendar considerations: Current date 2019-12-23 is just before Christmas; no clear historical holiday uplift for this basic lightweight T-shirt in the series\u2014recent Dec weeks remain low. (3) Recent trend analysis: Last 11 periods (35\u201345) average \u224876.5 with no sustained rebound; last four weeks = [109,61,55,64] average \u224872.8, slight short-term volatility but overall stable low regime.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
(1) Historical pattern summary: Training demands: [148,175,160,233,308] show an upward shift into test where peak periods reached 640 then declined. Test period series shows high mid-year peaks (Periods 11,17) followed by a persistent downward regime from Period 20 onward, stabilizing at low weekly levels in Nov\u2013Dec (~60\u2013110). (2) Seasonal/calendar considerations: Current date 2019-12-30 is the week after Christmas; historical nearby weeks show elevated pre-Christmas demand (Period 46=92) and Black Friday spikes earlier, but post-holiday weeks typically drop. No major retail event on 12/30 to suggest a spike. (3) Recent trend analysis: Last 4 weeks (Periods 43\u201346) = [61,55,64,92], mean = 68; median = 62.5. Variability present but no new sustained regime change (only a short uptick in Period 46). (4) Final forecast logic: Weight recent mean with slight conservatism toward the low post-holiday baseline; forecast rounded to nearest integer.
