Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. No on-hand or in-transit; no concluded arrivals to infer lead time, so keep promised L. Demand history shows a clear upward shift in recent periods (last three: 160, 233, 308). To adapt to higher recent demand while limiting hold cost, set L=default (promised 2). Use recent_N N=3 for mu_hat to make the base-stock responsive to the upward regime. Use recent_N N=3 for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Recent demand regime increase: last 3 demands mean=~233.7 vs full-sample mean=204.8; evidence: sequence 160\u2192233\u2192308 (Periods most recent).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. On-hand=0, in-transit=356, Period1 order (356) has not arrived (arrived=0 in Period1 conclude) but promised lead time=2 \u2014 absence of arrival this early is expected. Demand history shows a recent upward regime: last 3 demands = [160,233,308] mean=233.67 vs full-sample mean=204.8. I keep L at the promised lead time (default) and use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the higher recent demand and its volatility. This raises the base-stock target to better cover the (1+L) review+lead period demand while the pipeline (356) likely covers upcoming demand in the short run.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). Recent demand shows an uptick: last 3 demands = [160,233,308], mean \u2248233.7 vs full-sample mean \u2248204.8. Observed lead-time evidence: Period 2 conclude shows an arrival from Period 1 with lead_time=1, so average observed lead time=1 (shorter than promised 2). On-hand (40) + in-transit (331)=371 units, which covers multiple upcoming periods at the recent demand level, but I will size forecast to the recent higher regime to avoid stockouts. Therefore: infer L from observed data (calculate), set mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to capture the higher recent mean across review+lead period, and set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias ordering toward higher service (protect against the recent demand surge) while keeping variability estimates aligned with the most recent regime.

Carry-over insight: Recent demand regime increase: last 3 demands mean\u2248233.7 vs full-sample mean\u2248204.8; evidence: sequence 160\u2192233\u2192308 (Periods most recent).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04 (Period 4). Recent demand regime shows uplift: last 3 demands = [160,233,308], mean\u2248233.7 > full-sample mean\u2248204.8. On-hand=0, in-transit=570 (orders: P2=331, P3=239); no concluded lost shipments, one observed lead_time=1 (P1\u2192P2). I set L via "calculate" to use observed lead-time data (avg=1). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to capture the higher recent mean and volatility; this raises target base-stock to cover the (1+L) review+lead period demand while reflecting recent regime, balancing service level vs holding cost given modest profit/holding ratio.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). Recent demand regime increased (last 3 demands 160,233,308 \u2192 mean\u2248233.7 vs full-sample mean\u2248204.8). Concluded lead-time evidence: one observed arrival shows lead_time=1 (Period2 conclude). Several subsequent orders did not arrive on time, but only concluded data may be used; average observed lead_time=1. To capture the recent upward demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 (uses most recent 3 samples). L set to "calculate" so backend averages observed lead times. These choices raise target base stock to cover the higher recent demand while using recent volatility for safety given potential lost shipments.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/18. Recent demand has increased (sequence 160\u2192233\u2192308); on-hand=79, in-transit=283 (matches orders from Periods 3\u20135: 239+39+5). Observed lead times from concluded messages: 1 (P2 arrival for P1 order) and 3 (P5 arrival for P2 order) \u2192 average=2, so set L='calculate'. Several orders (e.g. Period 3 order) arrived later than promised (sign of lead-time variability/delays), so use recent demand (last 3 samples) to capture the upward regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This raises the target base-stock to service higher short-term demand while acknowledging holding cost tradeoff.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). Recent demands show an upward regime (last 3 demands 160,233,308 mean\u2248233.7 vs full-sample mean\u2248204.8). On-hand=0, in-transit=460.

Set mu_hat recent_N N=3 to target the higher recent demand regime (covers review+lead period). Set sigma_hat recent_N N=3 to capture recent volatility. These choices raise the target base-stock to improve service during the recent demand uptick while using recent volatility to moderate safety stock and limit holding costs given current large in-transit position.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period start 2019-04-01. Observed concluded lead times: 1 (P2 from P1), 3 (P5 from P2), 2 (P6 from P4) \u2192 average \u22482, so set L to calculated average. Demand history [148,175,160,233,308]; recent regime increase evident in last 3 demands (160,233,308) mean\u2248233.7 > full-sample mean\u2248204.8. Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the higher recent demand; use recent_N (N=3) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. On-hand=0, in-transit=547; multiple late/zero arrivals in history indicate irregular arrivals but L=calculate uses observed lead times to compensate. Parameters bias toward higher service level to avoid stockouts given recent demand spike while sigma updated on recent sample to control safety stock.

Use calculated average lead time to capture realized delays; use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to target the higher recent demand regime ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 3 samples) and recent_N (N=3) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These settings raise target base stock for the higher-demand regime while letting the OR engine compute L from observed arrivals to accommodate delayed/lost shipments.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22. Recent realized demands are high (Periods 8-10 demands = 372,271,310) and on-hand=0 with in-transit=706. Observed concluded lead times = {1,3,2,3,2} \u2192 average \u22482.2, so I use the calculated average lead time to capture the longer/variable transit reality. Demand shows an upward shift in the most recent periods (last 3 mean \u2248317.7) vs earlier history, so I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to focus the forecast and volatility on the newest regime. This increases the base-stock to reduce imminent stockouts while keeping sigma based on recent variability to avoid over-ordering. Using L=calculate aligns the lead-time assumption with observed arrivals and mitigates lost/long shipments.

Carry-over insight: Recent demand regime increased: last 3 concluded demands (Periods 8-10) mean\u2248317.7 vs full-history mean substantially lower; evidence: 372,271,310 (Periods 8-10).

Pipeline shows 326 units in-transit and on-hand=0; several past orders experienced variable lead times (observed concluded lead_times = [1,3,2,3,2,3,2]). I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the average observed lead time (captures the >2-period reality evidenced by multiple 3-period arrivals). For demand I use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the most recent high-demand regime (Periods 9\u201311 / 8\u201310 as appropriate). These choices raise target base-stock to improve service during the sustained higher-demand regime while sigma_hat recent_N captures increased variability to avoid underordering given past delayed arrivals.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/6 (Period 13). On-hand=0, in-transit=861. Historical concluded lead times show variability (1,3,2,3,2,3,2) with recent mode around 2\u20133 periods; several orders have late arrivals but not lost. Demand has accelerated recently (large demands in Periods 10\u201312). I set L to recent_N to reflect the latest lead-time regime (avg of last 5 observed lead times) so the OR engine inflates pipeline coverage above the promised 2. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=3 to capture the newest high-demand regime (most recent concluded demands: 310,564,424) so base-stock and safety stock respond to the surge. This increases service-level (reduces stockouts) while accepting higher holding cost given strong recent demand and substantial in-transit stock.

Carry-over insight: Recent demand regime increased: last 3 concluded demands (Periods 10-12) mean\u2248432.7 vs full-history mean much lower; evidence: 310,564,424 (Periods 10-12).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13): on-hand=0, in-transit=943. Concluded arrivals show variable lead-times (observed W = 1,3,2,3,2,3,2; avg\u22482.29) and recent demand has jumped (Periods 11-13 demands = 564,424,304; recent 3-mean \u2248430.7 vs full-history mean much lower). Several orders experienced >2-period delays but ultimately arrived, so use inferred average lead time to hedge against extended transit. Set L by calculating average observed lead time to capture real pipeline delay. Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to size base stock to the elevated short-term demand regime (covers review+lead period). This prioritizes service during the current high-demand regime while reflecting increased variability from recent periods.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20 (Period 15). Recent concluded demand has increased sharply (recent 3 concluded demands = 424,304,431 => mean\u2248386.3 vs full-history mean\u2248204.8). Observed concluded lead times (from conclude history) show variability around promised L=2 with recent arrivals indicating longer delays (recent observed lead times = [3,2,3,2] -> avg=2.5). To protect service with limited on-hand (0) and large in-transit (943) while acknowledging longer recent lead times, set L using recent observed lead times and set demand forecast based on the most recent 3-demand regime. Methods chosen balance higher target base_stock for elevated demand while using recent volatility for safety.

Carry-over insight: Recent demand regime elevated: last 3 concluded demands (Periods 12-14) mean\u2248386.3 vs full-history mean\u2248204.8; evidence: 424,304,431.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/27 (Period 16). On-hand=0, in-transit=861. Recent concluded demands show an elevated regime (recent 3-period mean \u2248386 units vs full-sample mean \u2248205). Observed concluded lead times = [1,3,2,3,2,3,2] (avg \u22482.29) with recent values clustering at 2\u20133. To capture the recent faster-than-1 but variable lead times, set L by averaging the most recent observed lead times. For demand, use the recent 3-period regime (captures 424,304,431 \u2192 higher mean) so mu_hat scales (1+L)\xd7recent mean; sigma_hat uses recent volatility (last 3) to reflect current variability. These choices bias orders toward higher service (higher mu_hat) given strong recent demand and substantial in-transit stock, while L recent_N reflects slightly >2 realized lead time to avoid under-ordering if some shipments are delayed.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). On-hand=0, in-transit=861 \u2014 large pipeline but no on-hand. Observed concluded lead times = [1,3,2,3,2,3,2], average \u22482.29 indicating realized lead time > promised 2 and occasional multi-period delays. Demand has clearly shifted up recently: last 3 concluded demands (Periods 14-16) = [431,442,435], mean \u2248436. To protect service vs holding cost: set L to the observed average (calculated) so OR accounts for real delays; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3 demands to capture the elevated regime and higher short-term variability.

Carry-over insight: Observed lead-time regime shifted upward: observed mean lead_time \u22482.29 (samples: 1,3,2,3,2,3,2) indicating frequent 2\u20133 period delays; treat shipments as at-risk of multi-period arrival.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019/6/10). On-hand=0, in-transit=876. Recent concluded demands show a sharp uptick: last 3 concluded demands (Periods 15-17) = 442, 435, 640 \u2192 mean \u2248 505.7, high variance. Historical concluded lead-times = {1,3,2,3,2,3,2} \u2192 mean \u22482.29 and shipments often arrive 2\u20133 periods after order (some shipments still outstanding), so treat lead time as longer than promised. To protect service during this elevated-demand regime while controlling holding cost, set L by averaging observed lead times (capture multi-period delays), set mu_hat using a short recent-window (N=3) to reflect the current high demand regime, and set sigma_hat from the same recent window to represent current volatility. These parameters increase target base-stock to reduce lost sales in the face of multi-period arrivals while using recent volatility to limit excessive overstock.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). On-hand=0, in-transit=1083. Recent concluded demands elevated: Periods 16-18 demands = 435, 640, 419 (mean\u2248498). Historical deliveries show frequent 2\u20133 period delays and some lost/missing arrivals. To avoid stockouts given at-risk pipeline, I set lead time conservatively to 3 periods. I use a recent-3 demand estimate (captures current elevated regime) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend sizes base-stock and cap to cover the higher short-term demand while accounting for increased uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Observed lead-time regime shifted upward: mean lead_time \u22482.3 with frequent 2\u20133 period delays (evidence: multiple orders arriving with lead_times 2\u20133 across Periods 2\u201318); recent demand regime elevated: recent concluded demands (Periods 16-18) mean\u2248498 (435,640,419).

Historical concluded lead_times = [1,3,2,3,2,3,2] (mean\u22482.29) indicating frequent 2\u20133 period delays and some lost/late arrivals; recent concluded demands (Periods 17-19) = [640,419,439] show a higher demand regime (mean\u2248499). To guard against extended/variable lead time I set L to 'calculate' so the backend uses observed lead times rather than the promised 2. For demand I use recent_N N=3 to capture the elevated short-term demand (covers review+lead period via backend scaling). For volatility I use recent_N N=3 to reflect increased demand variance in the same recent window. These choices raise base-stock to improve service during the higher-demand regime while the longer inferred lead time accounts for multi-period arrival risk and reduces stockouts from in-transit uncertainty.

Historical concluded lead_times show frequent 2\u20133 period delays (samples include 1,3,2,3,2,3,2,3 \u2192 mean \u22482.3); several orders arrive 2\u20133 periods after ordering so use observed-average lead time. Demand has been elevated recently; last 3 concluded demands (Periods 20-22) = [301,232,238], recent mean \u2248257 > full-sample mean (~204.8). I set L to the calculated average of observed lead times to capture multi-period delays. For forecasting I use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the elevated short-term regime and higher variability, so the OR engine raises the base-stock while keeping cap constraints. This balances service (avoid stockouts given long/variable lead times) against holding cost by relying on short-window evidence rather than full-history dilution.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime remains elevated with frequent 2\u20133 period delays; observed mean lead_time \u22482.3 (evidence: multiple concluded arrivals with lead_times 1,3,2,3,2,3,2,3). Recent demand (Periods 20-22) mean \u2248257 (301,232,238) \u2014 sustained above long-run mean.

LLM Rationale:

Historical concluded arrivals show an elevated, variable lead-time regime (frequent 2\u20133 period delays), so infer lead time from observed history rather than trusting the promise. Recent concluded demands (Periods 21\u201323 = 232,238,212) are lower than earlier spikes; use a short recent window to capture current demand level. Choices: L -> calculate (use observed lead-time average to reflect 2\u20133 period delays); mu_hat -> recent_N with N=3 to base (1+L)\xd7mean on the last 3 concluded demands; sigma_hat -> default to let backend scale volatility with (1+L).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/29 (Period 25). On-hand=0, in-transit=1577. Historical concluded lead-times show frequent 2\u20133 period delays (1,3,2,3,2,3,2,3) so I treat actual lead time as > promised. Demand history shows a recent higher regime but the last 5 concluded demands (Periods 20\u201324 = 301,232,238,212,207) give a stable short-run mean above the long-run mean. Decisions: infer L from observed concluded lead-times (calculate) to capture multi-period delays; set mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 to anchor the base-stock to the recent demand level over the review+lead horizon; keep sigma_hat as default to reflect full-sample volatility scaled by (1+L). This combination raises target inventory to buffer late arrivals while using recent demand to avoid overstocking from older high outliers.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=0, in-transit=1577. Historical concluded arrivals show frequent 2\u20133 period delays (observed lead_times mean \u22482.4 across concluded arrivals), and recent demand has softened (last 3 concluded demands Periods 23\u201325 = 212,207,154 \u2192 mean \u2248191). To account for the elevated actual lead-time risk I set L to 'calculate' so the backend uses observed lead-time average. For demand I use recent_N (N=3) to anchor mu_hat to the latest regime (lower last-3 mean) and reduce overstating order quantities given large in-transit. sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent volatility. These choices prioritize avoiding excess holding given high in-transit volume while respecting longer realized lead times.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). On-hand=0, in-transit=1577. Concluded history shows frequent 2\u20133 period arrivals (many orders arriving with lead_times 2\u20133) so actual lead time remains elevated; some shipments have long delays but pipeline currently large. Recent demand has fallen in the last three concluded periods (Periods 24-26: 207,154,102) versus earlier elevated regimes, so use a short recent window to avoid overforecasting. I choose L='calculate' to capture the empirically observed elevated lead time; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=3 to align the replenishment target to the most recent lower demand regime and reduce overstock risk given a large in-transit pipeline. This raises service while limiting holding cost because pipeline already supplies multiple periods.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime remains elevated (frequent 2\u20133 period delays; mean\u22482.3) based on multiple concluded arrivals; recent demand regime has shifted down in the last 3 periods (Periods 24-26 mean\u2248154.3).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Recent demand has fallen sharply over the last few weeks (Periods 24-27: 207,154,102,120) while substantial pipeline exists (on-hand=0, in-transit=1577). Observed concluded lead_times = [1,3,2,3,2,3,2,3] \u2192 mean \u22482.38, confirming an elevated 2\u20133 period arrival regime. To balance service and holding cost I (a) set L to the empirically observed average (calculate) so the OR engine accounts for slower/multi-period arrivals; (b) use a recent_N (N=3) mu_hat to reflect the pronounced recent downturn in demand and avoid over-ordering despite large pipeline; (c) use recent_N (N=3) sigma_hat so safety stock reflects the lower recent variability. This keeps target base-stock modest while acknowledging longer/multi-period lead times and the existing in-transit inventory.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=0, in-transit=1577 (pipeline large but prior arrivals have shown frequent 2\u20133 period delays). Recent demand has trended down in the last 3 concluded periods (Periods 26-28 = 102,120,158). I set L to recent_N to reflect the elevated 2\u20133 period lead-time regime using the most recent observed lead-time samples. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to base the (1+L) demand forecast and volatility on the latest low-demand regime, keeping orders conservative to avoid excess holding given holding cost=$1 and profit=$2.

Carry-over insight: Recent demand regime has shifted down: Periods 26-28 mean\u2248126.7 (102,120,158); lead-time regime remains elevated with frequent 2\u20133 period delays (observed mean\u22482.3).

Historical concluded arrivals show frequent 2\u20133 period delays (mean \u22482.3) so shipments are at-risk of multi-period arrival; use explicit L to reflect observed reality. Demand has moderated recently (last ~3\u20136 periods below earlier spikes) and we currently hold a large pipeline, so keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7full-sample mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using the chosen L).

Recent demand has declined: last 3 concluded demands (Periods 28-30) = [158,140,145], mean \u2248147.7. To protect against delayed arrivals use a recent-average lead time; to match current lower demand regime use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=3) so orders target (1+L) periods of the recent demand profile and reduced volatility.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime remains elevated (frequent 2\u20133 period delays, observed mean \u22482.3 across recent concluded arrivals); recent demand regime has shifted down (Periods 28-30 mean \u2248147.7).

For sigma_hat I use recent_N (N=3) to reflect lower recent volatility. These choices avoid over-ordering given long/uncertain lead times and large in-transit pipeline while matching current lower demand to balance service vs holding cost and mitigate at-risk shipments.

To capture sustained longer lead-times I let the backend compute the average observed lead time from concluded arrivals (method=calculate). To reflect the recent downshift in demand I forecast (1+L)\xd7mean using the last 3 demands (N=3) and likewise estimate volatility from the last 3 samples so the base-stock and cap respond to the lower recent demand while the lead-time estimate preserves protection against multi-period delays.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-30 (Period 34). Recent demand has settled to a lower regime vs earlier spikes: last 3 concluded demands (Periods 31-33) = [141,135,147], mean \u2248 141. On-hand=0, in-transit=1577 (large pipeline). Historical concluded arrivals show an elevated lead-time regime with frequent 2\u20133 period delays. I set L to 'calculate' so the backend uses observed lead times average (captures the 2\u20133 period pattern). For demand I use recent_N with N=3 to anchor mu_hat to the most recent low-demand regime and avoid over-ordering given the large in-transit. sigma_hat uses recent_N N=3 to reflect current lower variability. This keeps target base-stock aligned with current low demand while the backend's cap will limit order size against the large pipeline, mitigating risk from at-risk/multi-period arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime elevated: recently observed lead_times frequently 2\u20133 periods (mean \u22482.3) \u2014 treat shipments as at-risk of multi-period arrival; Recent demand regime shifted down: last 3 concluded demands (Periods 31-33) mean \u2248141 (141,135,147).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21 (Period 37). On-hand=0, in-transit=1577. Historical concluded arrivals show a persistent elevated lead-time regime (frequent 2\u20133 period delays). Recent demand has declined over the last 3 concluded periods (Periods 34-36: 106,85,84). To protect against at-risk multi-period arrivals I set lead-time explicitly above the promised 2. For demand I use the most recent 3 periods to capture the current downshift when computing (1+L)-period demand and volatility.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime elevated: observed mean lead_time \u22482.3 with frequent 2\u20133 period delays (evidence: multiple concluded arrivals across history). Recent demand regime shifted down: Periods 34-36 mean\u224891.7 (106,85,84).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). Recent demand regime has shifted down: last 3 concluded demands (Periods 35-37) = [85,84,109], mean \u224892.7 vs long-run mean \u2248204.8. Observed lead-times have been elevated and variable (frequent 2\u20133 period delays); treat shipments as at-risk of multi-period arrival. Current inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=1577 (sufficient pipeline but arrival timings uncertain). Choose L explicit=2.3 to reflect elevated observed lead-time regime; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to capture the current down-shift in demand (focus policy on latest regime and reduce forecasted mean/volatility accordingly). These parameters bias ordering toward the recent lower demand while acknowledging longer, noisy lead-times to avoid overstocking.

Observed concluded lead-times frequently 2\u20133 periods; use calculated average lead time to capture that regime. Recent demand (last 3 concluded periods 36-38 = 84,109,78) remains low vs long-run, so forecast mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent 3 samples to reflect the current low-demand regime and reduced variance. This keeps orders responsive to the recent drop while the large in-transit stock provides cover for uncertainty.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/11 (Period 40). On-hand=0, in-transit=1577. Historical concluded lead-times show frequent 2\u20133 period arrivals (observed mean \u22482.3); recent demand has shifted down from summer highs to ~61\u2013109 in the last 6 periods (Periods 34\u201339 mean \u224887). To account for elevated actual lead-time risk, set L to be inferred from observed history (calculate). To reflect the recent low-demand regime, use recent_N for demand forecast and volatility using the last 6 concluded demands (N=6). This keeps mu_hat responsive to the recent downshift while sigma_hat captures recent volatility; using calculate for L helps the OR engine plan for multi-period delays so pipeline coverage (1+L) is realistic given at-risk shipments.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/18 (Period 41). On-hand=0, in-transit=1577. Historical concluded lead-times show an elevated regime (mean\u22482.3 with frequent 2\u20133 period delays); shipments remain at-risk of multi-period arrival so be conservative on L. Recent concluded demand has shifted down sharply in the last 3 periods (Periods 38-40 demands 78,61,69 \u2192 mean\u224869); use recent_N=3 for demand forecast and volatility to reflect this new low-demand regime. Setting L explicit=3 cushions for delayed arrivals and avoids overestimating available pipeline; mu_hat recent_N=3 and sigma_hat recent_N=3 focus the OR backend on the most recent low-demand regime so base-stock and caps shrink accordingly, reducing holding cost while matching lower demand.

Carry-over insight: Recent demand regime has fallen further: Periods 38-40 mean\u224869 (78,61,69) \u2014 sustained downshift vs prior regimes; lead-time regime remains elevated with frequent 2\u20133 period delays (observed mean\u22482.3).

Historical concluded lead_times show frequent 2\u20133 period delays; demand has fallen recently (last periods 38-41: 78,61,69,67 \u2192 recent mean ~68). To be responsive to the latest low-demand regime while recognizing elevated/variable lead time, set L to be estimated from observed lead-time history (allow backend to average concluded lead times).

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/2 (Period 43). On-hand=0, in-transit=1577. Historical concluded arrivals show persistent multi-period delays (many lead_times =2\u20133); use calculated average lead time to capture that regime. Recent demand has modestly ticked up in the last 3 concluded periods (Periods 40-42: 69,67,109 \u2192 mean\u224881.7) versus the very low trough earlier; use a 3-period recent estimate for mu_hat and sigma_hat to adapt quickly to this uptick while keeping exposure limited given holding cost. These settings let the OR backend size base-stock to cover the elevated effective lead time and the most recent demand level, balancing service vs holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime remains elevated: observed mean lead_time \u22482.3 with frequent 2\u20133 period delays (evidence: multiple concluded arrivals with lead_times 1,3,2,3,2,3,2,3); Recent demand: small uptick in last 3 concluded demands (Periods 40-42 = 69,67,109; mean\u224881.7) compared with immediate prior trough.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/9 (Period 44). Historical concluded arrivals show persistent 2\u20133 period deliveries (observed mean lead_time \u22482.3) so shipments are at-risk of multi-period arrival; recent demand has settled at a lower regime (last 3 concluded demands Periods 41-43 = 67,109,61; mean\u224879). Set L explicitly to reflect elevated observed lead time. For demand, use recent_N=3 to capture the current low-demand regime; same N for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These parameters bias orders toward covering the extended pipeline while keeping stock aligned to the low recent demand to limit holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime elevated: observed mean lead_time \u22482.3 with frequent 2\u20133 period delays (evidence: many concluded arrivals with lead_times 1,3,2,3,2,3,2,3); Recent demand regime downshift: last 3 concluded demands (Periods 41-43) mean\u224879 (67,109,61).

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019-12-23): history shows frequent 2\u20133 period actual lead times (mean \u22482.3) and recent demand has fallen (last 3 concluded demands 61,55,64 \u2192 mean \u224860). On-hand=0, in-transit=1577. To protect against at-risk multi-period arrivals I set lead time explicitly to 3. To reflect the recent low-demand regime I use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend sizes base-stock and caps to current low demand and observed short-term volatility.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30. Recent demand regime is low (latest concluded demands ~109,61,55,64,92) after prior elevated spikes. On-hand=0, in-transit=1577 (pipeline large but arrivals have been delayed historically). Observed arrivals in concluded history show frequent 2\u20133 period lead times (mean \u22482.3) so use backend's lead-time estimator from observed data. To keep forecasts responsive to the recent downshift, set demand estimates from the most recent 5 periods. Using recent_N for sigma to reflect recent volatility; using calculate for L lets backend average observed lead times and capture the 2\u20133 period regime. These settings aim to prevent over-ordering given large in-transit inventory while maintaining service during at-risk delayed arrivals.
