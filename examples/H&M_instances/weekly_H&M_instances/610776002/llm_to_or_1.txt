Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. SKU is a non-seasonal womens basic T-shirt. Historical demands = [148,175,160,233,308] (mean \u2248 204.8, std \u2248 58.5). No concluded arrival messages yet and on-hand/in-transit = 0, so no evidence of lead-time deviation or lost shipments. Use promised lead time to keep OR backend aligned with contract (L=default). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample \u2014 this balances service level (profit/holding tradeoff) without overfitting to short-term noise given limited history.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). Recent conclude shows the Period 1 order (314) has not arrived yet \u2014 expected given promised lead time=4, so no evidence to shorten/lengthen lead time. Historical demand samples = [148,175,160,233,308] (mean=204.8); use full-sample defaults to capture overall demand and variability. Choose default L to honor promised lead time and avoid misinterpreting the single non-arrival. Default mu_hat and sigma_hat let the OR engine compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level (profit $2 vs holding $1) without overreacting to limited early-period noise.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/2/25 (Period 3). Recent concluded history shows two outstanding orders (314, 321) with zero arrivals; in-transit=635 equals those outstanding orders. No concluded arrivals => cannot infer actual lead time. Historical demand samples = [148,175,160,233,308] (mean=204.8). Promised lead time is 4; using default lead time keeps OR engine aligned with contract. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from full sample, capturing all historical demand while remaining conservative given no evidence of regime change. This keeps base-stock targeting multi-period demand (5 periods) while allowing the capped order logic to limit single-period receipts given the existing 635 units in transit.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/4 (Period 4). Demand history: [148,175,160,233,308] (mean 204.8). On-hand=0, in-transit=980 from prior orders; three concluded periods show ordered but arrived=0, so shipments delayed or at risk. No concluded arrival messages include lead-time values, so no reliable evidence to change promised lead time (4). To avoid overreacting to potentially lost shipments while the OR engine assumes promised L=4, use default lead time and default demand stats ((1+L)\xd7mean, sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This keeps the backend's statistical forecast aligned with historical demand while we monitor for confirmed lead-time changes in future conclude messages.

Carry-over insight: Delayed arrivals: three consecutive conclude messages show ordered units but arrived=0 (Periods 1-3); in-transit total=980 \u2014 treat as likely delayed/lost until conclude confirms actual arrivals.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 decision (2019-03-11). On-hand=0, in-transit=1263 which equals orders placed in Periods 1-4; these orders are not yet visible in concludes because promised lead time=4 implies the Period 1 order will conclude in Period 5 (readable in Period 6). Historical demands = [148,175,160,233,308], mean=204.8. No confirmed late-loss from conclude history yet (no concluded arrivals beyond promised). Use promised lead time and aggregate historical demand to let the OR backend compute base-stock and caps: L default to keep consistent with promise, mu_hat default to capture (1+L)\xd7overall mean, sigma_hat default to capture overall volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances service (avoid stockouts from high recent demand like 308) vs holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Carry-over insight: Delayed arrivals note retained: in-transit total=1263 equals ordered units from Periods 1-4; treat as pending until conclude confirms arrivals.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/18 (Period 6). Recent conclude shows an arrival from Period 1 with lead_time=4, matching promised lead time. On-hand=62, in-transit=971 (likely orders from Periods 2-5 still pending). Historical demand samples available; no strong recent changepoint in demand mean/variance. Use promised lead time and default demand stats so OR backend applies its (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std formulas, keeping policy simple while awaiting more conclude data to detect lost shipments or lead-time shifts.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). Recent realized demand is higher than the older seed data (recent demands: 252,270 plus prior 283,306,316,266), on-hand=113, in-transit=902. Concluded arrivals show orders placed in Periods 1\u20132 arrived with lead_time=4 (Periods 5\u20136 conclude), confirming actual lead time \u22484. Use lead-time inference (calculate) to reflect observed lead times. To capture the recent upward demand regime, set mu_hat using a recent_N window of 5 (focus on most recent demand samples). Use recent_N for sigma_hat (N=5) to reflect current volatility. These settings raise the target base-stock to cover the (1+L) review+lead horizon and align service level with profit/holding tradeoff while acknowledging in-transit units may still arrive per conclude messages.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods based on Periods 5\u20136 arrivals (ordered on Periods 1\u20132, lead_time=4); retain prior delayed-arrival caution for remaining in-transit until concludes update.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Recent concluded history shows actual lead_time = 4 (orders on Periods 1\u20133 arrived in Periods 5\u20137). On-hand=94, in-transit=886 (pending; some earlier shipments were delayed then arrived). Recent demand has risen (last 5 demands: 283,252,270,364, ? \u2014 using last 5 concluded periods to capture current regime). To reflect confirmed L=4 and focus forecast on the recent higher-demand regime, I set L by calculating observed lead times and use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend emphasizes the most recent demand pattern while keeping safety vs holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (evidence: Periods 5\u20137 conclude messages: orders from Periods 1\u20133 arrived with lead_time=4); retain caution that remaining in-transit (886 units) may include delayed shipments until their concludes confirm arrivals.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=5, in-transit=970 with concluded history confirming actual lead time=4 periods (consistent across concluded orders). To protect service while avoiding excess holding, infer L from observed lead times and use a recent-window forecast (last 5 periods) for mu and sigma to capture the new higher-demand regime.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). On-hand=0, in-transit=1348. Recent concludes show actual lead_time=4 consistently (orders from Periods 1\u20135 arrived with W=4). Demand has stepped up recently: Periods 5\u20139 demands = [252,270,364,372,271] (mean \u2248306). Given confirmed L=4 and higher recent demand, I use a lead-time estimate reflecting observed behavior and set demand forecast and volatility from the most recent 5 periods to capture the new regime. This ensures the OR backend sizes base-stock for the (1+L) review+lead window using current elevated demand while keeping sigma based on recent variability; it also acknowledges large in-transit volume may still be pending until concludes confirm arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (evidence: conclude messages for orders placed on Periods 1\u20135 all show lead_time=4); Recent demand regime shift upward: Periods 5\u20139 demands = [252,270,364,372,271], mean \u2248306 \u2014 use recent-5 stats for forecasts.

On-hand=0, in-transit=1333 (pending arrivals from recent orders) \u2014 pipeline plus expected arrivals should cover upcoming demand but use recent-demand stats to capture the higher regime.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). Recent demand regime shifted up: Periods 5\u20139 demands = [252,270,364,372,271], mean ~306; Period 11 demand spike (564) was stock-constrained (sold 329). Actual lead time consistently observed = 4 periods in conclude messages (Periods 5\u201311). On-hand=0, in-transit=1306 (pending arrivals from recent orders) \u2014 treat pipeline as expected but confirm via future concludes. Therefore: set L to default promised lead time (4) consistent with confirmed observations; set mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture the new higher-demand regime; set sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep base-stock tied to the confirmed 4-period lead time and recent higher demand, improving service while avoiding excessive extra safety stock beyond recent variability and holding cost.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). On-hand=0, in-transit=1501. Historical concluded lead times consistently =4 (Periods 5\u201312 conclude messages show orders from Periods 1\u20138 arriving with lead_time=4). Recent demand has risen vs earlier baseline: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 8\u201312) = [372,271,310,564,424], mean \u2248388 and higher variance. Given confirmed L=4 and elevated recent demand, use L=default (promised 4) and forecast using recent-5 demand to capture the new high-demand regime; use recent-5 for sigma to reflect increased volatility. This gives the OR engine up-to-date mu_hat and sigma_hat over the review+lead horizon while relying on the confirmed lead-time behavior to avoid underordering despite substantial in-transit inventory that may still include delayed shipments.

Carry-over insight: Recent demand regime shift upward: Periods 8\u201312 demands = [372,271,310,564,424], mean\u2248388; sustained higher mean and higher variance vs prior periods. Confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (evidence: conclude messages for orders placed on Periods 1\u20138 arrived with lead_time=4).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

On-hand=96, in-transit=1652 \u2014 pipeline is large but some prior shipments were delayed before being confirmed; however concluded history now consistently shows 4-period arrivals. Set L to promised/default (4) to match confirmed actual lead time and OR expectations. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained higher mean and volatility in the most recent regime, ensuring base_stock and safety stock reflect current demand levels while avoiding over-reliance on older low-demand samples.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20 (Period 15). On-hand=0, in-transit=1657 (pending deliveries). Concluded history reliably shows actual lead time = 4 periods; recent demand has shifted up. I set L to default (promised lead time=4) to align with confirmed arrivals. For demand I use recent_N with N=5 (last 5 observed demands, Periods 10\u201314 = [310,564,424,304,431], mean\u2248406.6) so mu_hat captures the elevated regime across the review+lead window. Sigma_hat uses recent_N N=5 to reflect the higher variance seen in these recent samples. This keeps base_stock responsive to the sustained demand increase while using the confirmed lead time; it also accounts for large in-transit volume (avoids over-ordering beyond pipeline) by letting the OR backend compute net ordering against pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Sustained higher demand regime confirmed: Periods 10\u201314 demands = [310,564,424,304,431], mean\u2248406.6; retain confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods based on concluded arrivals.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods for concluded orders; large in-transit balance (1834) represents pending arrivals but prior concludes confirm LT=4. Recent demand has risen markedly \u2014 last 5 observed demands (Periods 11\u201315) = [564,424,304,431,442], mean = 453 and elevated variance. To protect service with the confirmed L=4 while limiting holding cost, use recent-5 demand stats for forecast (captures the sustained high-demand regime) and match sigma to recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (evidence: concluded arrivals for orders placed on Periods 1\u201311 all show lead_time=4); Sustained higher demand regime: Periods 11\u201315 demands = [564,424,304,431,442], mean=453, higher variance vs earlier periods; large in-transit (1834) awaiting conclusion \u2014 monitor until concludes confirm arrivals.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). Recent demand has been in a higher regime; last 5 demands (Periods 12\u201316) = [424,304,431,442,435], mean\u2248407.2. On-hand=127 + in-transit=1692 provides pipeline but many units still awaiting conclude; historical concluded lead times consistently =4 periods, so use promised lead time. To reflect the sustained higher demand while capturing recent variability, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (captures current regime). This balances service (higher forecast) against holding cost by referencing the most recent demand regime and relying on confirmed L=4 for timing.

Carry-over insight: New: in-transit total updated to 1692 units pending conclusion; maintain confirmed actual lead_time=4 based on concluded arrivals; recent demand regime (Periods 12\u201316) mean\u2248407.2 \u2014 use recent-5 for forecasting.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=38, in-transit=1414 (large pipeline) and concluded history confirms actual lead time = 4 periods. To capture the elevated mean and volatility I use recent-5 demand stats for forecasting (captures the new regime and variance). L set to promised/default (4) because concluded arrivals consistently show LT=4. These choices give the OR engine an updated (higher) demand forecast while keeping LT aligned with confirmed arrivals; continue monitoring outstanding in-transit until their concludes verify arrivals.

Because large in-transit remains pending conclusion, I keep L conservative (default=promised) and use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the higher recent mean and higher variance, helping the OR engine raise base-stock while controlling cap via built-in cap calculation.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). Demand has been in a sustained higher regime; recent 5-period demands (Periods 15\u201319) = [442,435,640,419,439], average \u2248475 and elevated variance. On-hand=40, in-transit=1970 (large pipeline) and concluded history consistently shows actual lead time = 4 periods. I set L to promised (default) since concluded arrivals confirm a stable 4-period lead time. To capture the recent upward demand regime I use recent-5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7recent mean and volatility over the most relevant window, which raises target base-stock to avoid stockouts while sigma_hat recent_N increases safety stock to reflect higher variability.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-01 (Period 21). Recent concluded history consistently shows actual lead time = 4 periods; large in-transit balance (2005) likely legitimate pending conclusions. On-hand = 159; pipeline is large so avoid overstating mean. Recent demand has shifted upward \u2014 use most recent 5 periods (Periods 16\u201320 demands = [435,640,419,439,301], mean \u2248 446.8) to reflect the current high-demand regime and higher variance. Set L to default (promised lead time = 4) because concluded arrivals confirm LT=4. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to make the OR engine forecast (1+L)-period demand from the most relevant regime, trading service level for holding cost given profit=$2/holding=$1 (q\u22480.667). This balances filling expected demand spikes while the large in-transit reduces aggressive topping-up.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (concluded arrivals through Period 20); Recent sustained higher demand regime: Periods 16\u201320 demands = [435,640,419,439,301], mean\u2248446.8; Large in-transit inventory (2005 units) pending conclusion\u2014monitor until individual concludes confirm arrivals.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-08). Recent demand regime remains elevated; last 5 demands (Periods 17-21) = [640,419,439,301,232], mean \u2248 406.2 \u2014 I will use recent-5 demand stats to capture the current higher mean and volatility. Concluded history consistently shows actual lead time = 4 periods, and there is large in-transit stock pending conclusion; therefore use promised lead time (default) for L. Using recent-5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat increases service level to avoid stockouts given high recent demand while accepting higher holding cost; this balances profit ($2) vs holding ($1) via the OR backend's quantile-based base stock.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019-07-15). Concluded history consistently shows actual lead time = 4 periods; on-hand=611 + in-transit=1333 provide coverage but sizable pipeline remains pending. Recent demand regime is higher\u2014use most recent 5 demand samples to capture current mean/variance. Choose L as promised (4), mu_hat from recent_5 to reflect elevated demand, and sigma_hat from recent_5 to reflect increased volatility. This balances service level (capture higher mean) against holding cost by using recent stats rather than full-history dilution.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22). Actual lead time historically confirmed = 4 periods. On-hand=1027, in-transit=705 \u2192 ample cover short-term. Recent demand elevated vs early history; using recent-5 sample forecast to capture current regime while trusting promised lead time. Set L=default to use promised (4). Use mu_hat recent_N (N=5) to target (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 5 demands so orders reflect the higher recent demand. Keep sigma_hat default so backend computes volatility from full sample scaled by \u221a(1+L). This balances service (avoid stockouts) with holding cost given high on-hand and pending transit.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead_time = 4 periods; on-hand=1275, in-transit=250 so immediate stock is ample. I set L to default (use promised lead time = 4). Recent demand has settled lower over the last 5 periods (Periods 20\u201324 demands = [301,232,238,212,207], mean \u2248238), so I use recent-5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the latest regime. Using recent-N concentrates the forecast on current demand and avoids inflating orders from earlier high-variance periods; with large on-hand this avoids excess holding cost while maintaining service level.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================

Concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead_time = 4 periods. On-hand = 1309, in-transit = 62 (low inbound). To preserve service while avoiding excess holding cost given current high on-hand and reduced recent demand, use promised lead time (default L=4) and forecast using the most recent 5-period demand regime for mu_hat; keep sigma_hat as default (uses full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L)) so the OR backend preserves conservative safety against long-run variability.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date=2019-08-12 (Period 27). Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods; use promised/default L. Recent demand (Periods 22\u201326) = [238,212,207,154,102], showing a notable downshift vs earlier spikes; with on-hand currently high (1269) and in-transit=0, forecast using recent-5 to capture this lower recent demand. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) so the OR engine targets (1+L)\xd7mean of the most recent 5 periods and volatility from those 5 samples\u2014this reduces over-ordering given large on-hand and no pipeline.

LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods from concluded history. On-hand is high (1149) and in-transit = 0, so we should dampen ordering. Recent demand has softened over the last 5 periods (Periods 23\u201327 demands = [212,207,154,102,120], mean \u2248160). Use L=default (promised lead time=4) and recent-5 demand stats so forecasts reflect the recent downshift and avoid excess inventory; use recent-5 volatility to reflect recent lower variability.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019/08/26). Recent demand has fallen sharply vs earlier high-demand regimes: Periods 24\u201328 demands = [207,154,102,120,158], mean\u2248148.2. On-hand = 991, in-transit = 0 (pipeline empty). Lead-time has been consistently 4 periods in concluded history. To avoid excess holding cost given high on-hand and recent low demand, use promised/default lead time and base mu/sigma on the most recent 5 periods (captures the downward regime). This reduces ordering pressure while the pipeline is empty and preserves service with lower target base-stock.

Carry-over insight: NEW: Recent demand drop: Periods 24\u201328 mean\u2248148.2 (down from prior higher-regime means). On-hand remains high (991) with in-transit=0 \u2014 recommend reduced ordering until demand signal sustains or pipeline rebuilds.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/2 (Period 30). Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods; no recent lost shipments. Recent demand has dropped from earlier high regime \u2014 last 5 demands (Periods 25\u201329) = [154,102,120,158,140], mean \u2248 134.8. On-hand is high (851) and in-transit = 0, so order pressure should be reduced. Set L to promised lead time (confirmed by concluded history).

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-09 (Period 31). On-hand=706, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show stable actual lead_time=4 (confirmed through Period 30). Recent demand regime has dropped: Periods 26\u201330 demands = [102,120,158,140,145], mean=133.0, lower variance vs prior high-regime. With high on-hand and zero pipeline, reduce forecast horizon to recent data. Set L to promised lead time (default=4) since concluded history confirms L=4. Use mu_hat recent_N (N=5) to capture the currently lower demand mean over the review+lead window. Use sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to capture current lower volatility. These choices lower target base_stock and cap orders, preventing excess holding cost while preserving service for near-term demand.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/10/7 (Period 35). Historical conclues confirm actual lead time = 4 periods. Recent demand regime shows sustained drop: last 5 demands (Periods 30\u201334) = [145,141,135,147,106], lower than earlier high-regime. On-hand=177, in-transit=430 \u2014 pipeline + on-hand already sizeable relative to recent demand, so reduce target stocking. Set L to promised (default) since conclues consistently show 4-period lead time. Use recent-5 for mu_hat to capture the current lower demand regime. Use recent-5 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These parameters reduce ordering pressure while preserving service against current lower demand.

Carry-over insight: Recent sustained demand drop confirmed: Periods 30\u201334 demands = [145,141,135,147,106], mean\u2248134.8; on-hand remains substantial (177) with in-transit=430 \u2014 recommend reduced ordering until demand signal strengthens.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/10/14 (Period 36). Historical concludes show stable actual lead_time=4. Recent demand has dropped over the last 5 periods (Periods 31\u201335 demands = [141,135,147,106,85], mean\u2248122.8) while on-hand is lowish (92) but sizable in-transit (514) pending future concludes. To avoid excess holding cost given the clear recent downward regime, keep L = promised (default) and use recent-5 demand statistics for forecasting (mu_hat recent_N N=5, sigma_hat recent_N N=5). This biases orders to match the lower recent demand while the existing in-transit stock reduces ordering urgency.

Carry-over insight: NEW: Recent sustained demand drop confirmed \u2014 Periods 31\u201335 demands = [141,135,147,106,85], mean\u2248122.8; on-hand=92 with in-transit=514 pending conclusion \u2014 recommend reduced ordering until demand signal strengthens or in-transit concludes.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). Recent demand has fallen and stabilized at a lower regime: last 5 demands (Periods 32-36) = [135,147,106,85,84], mean \u2248111.4 and lower recent volume. On-hand = 161, in-transit = 395 (pending conclusion); concluded history consistently shows actual lead time = 4 periods, so use promised/default lead time. To avoid over-ordering given substantial recent on-hand and small in-transit, forecast using recent-5 demand to reflect the current low-demand regime and use recent-5 volatility for safety stock calculation. Choices: L=default (promised 4) to align with confirmed lead-time evidence; mu_hat=recent_N N=5 to base (1+L)-period demand on the most recent regime; sigma_hat=recent_N N=5 to reflect recent lower variance. This reduces ordering pressure versus longer-term high-demand averages and keeps holding costs controlled while maintaining service for current demand.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods from concluded history; recent demand has fallen sharply. Last 5 observed demands (Periods 33-37) = [147,106,85,84,109], mean \u2248106.2. On-hand=197, in-transit=279 (pending concludes). To avoid excess holding cost given high recent drop and modest pipeline, use promised lead time (default) and base forecasts on the most recent 5-period regime. sigma_hat left as default to reflect historical volatility scaled by (1+L). This balances service (avoid stockouts if drop reverses) vs holding cost (reduce orders after sustained decline).

Carry-over insight: New recent demand drop: Periods 33-37 mean\u2248106.2; confirmed actual lead_time=4; in-transit=279 pending conclusion; recommend reduced ordering while monitoring concludes.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). Recent demand has fallen steadily; last 5 concluded demands (Periods 34-38) = [106,85,84,109,78], mean=92.4. On-hand=251, in-transit=331, and historical concluded lead time=4 periods. Use L=default to keep promised/confirmed lead time=4.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date=2019/11/11 (Period 40). Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods. Recent demand has fallen sharply: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 35\u201339) = [85,84,109,78,61], mean \u224883.4. On-hand=274 and in-transit=247 \u2014 inventory is ample vs. recent demand. I set L to default (promised lead time=4) because concluded history confirms it. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the current low-demand regime and avoid over-ordering. I also use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect reduced recent volatility. These choices bias the OR backend toward much lower target stock and therefore minimal new orders while current on-hand + pipeline cover multiple periods of demand.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (concluded arrivals through Period 39). Recent sustained demand drop: Periods 35\u201339 demands = [85,84,109,78,61], mean \u224883.4; on-hand=274 and in-transit=247 \u2192 recommend reduced ordering until demand strengthens or in-transit concludes.

Historical concluded lead time repeatedly =4. To avoid excess holding cost while preserving service, use promised lead time (default L=4) and forecast using the recent-5 demand regime for (1+L)-period demand. Use recent-5 volatility to reflect current lower variability. This reduces ordering pressure given substantial on-hand plus in-transit and current low demand.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/25 (Period 42). Actual lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods in concluded history. Recent demand has dropped substantially: last 5 demands (Periods 37\u201341) = [109,78,61,69,67], mean \u224876.8. On-hand = 201, in-transit = 184 \u2014 pipeline + on-hand adequate for near-term given low recent demand. I set L to default (promised 4). I use recent-5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current low-demand regime and reduce ordering pressure while in-transit concludes. This balances service level (cover current short-term demand) against holding cost by lowering forecasted review+lead demand and measured volatility.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (concluded arrivals through Period 41).

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). Recent concluded history shows confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods and a sustained demand drop in recent windows. Current inventory: on-hand=215, in-transit=127 (small pipeline). Recent 5-period demand (Periods 39\u201343) = [61,69,67,109,61], mean \u224873.4 \u2014 I use recent-5 to capture the current low-demand regime. L set to promised (default) because concluded messages consistently show 4-period lead time. mu_hat uses recent_N (N=5) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)*recent mean reflecting the new low-demand regime and avoids over-ordering into the high on-hand position. sigma_hat left as default so backend computes variability from all samples scaled by sqrt(1+L), giving a conservative safety stock given limited pipeline. This combination reduces ordering pressure while service-level tradeoffs are handled by the OR engine.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (concluded arrivals through Period 43). New sustained low-demand regime: Periods 39\u201343 demands = [61,69,67,109,61], mean \u224873.4; on-hand=215 with in-transit=127 \u2014 recommend reduced ordering while monitoring remaining in-transit.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16 (Period 45). Recent demand has been low: last 5 demands (Periods 40\u201344) = [69,67,109,61,55], mean \u224872.2. On-hand = 160, in-transit = 287; pipeline plus on-hand (~447) already covers several periods of demand, so order pressure should be reduced. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods. I set L to default (use promised/confirmed 4). For forecasting I use recent-5 (captures the current low-demand regime) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine reduces target base-stock and variability to avoid excess holding costs given current ample on-hand.

Carry-over insight: Recent sustained low-demand regime confirmed: Periods 40\u201344 demands = [69,67,109,61,55], mean \u224872.2; on-hand=160 with in-transit=287 \u2014 recommend reduced ordering until demand strengthens or remaining in-transit concludes.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019-12-23). Demand has been in a sustained low regime; recent 5 concluded demands (Periods 41\u201345) = [67,109,61,55,64], mean \u224871.2. On-hand=96, in-transit=287 (pending conclusions). Historical concluded lead times consistently =4 periods. To avoid overstock while preserving service, keep promised lead time and use recent-5 demand stats for forecast and volatility so orders reflect the lower regime and current pipeline.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019/12/30). Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods. Recent demand has settled in a low regime; last 5 demands (Periods 42\u201346) = [109,61,55,64,92], mean \u224876.2. On-hand=22, in-transit=269 (pending concludes). To limit holding cost while maintaining service, set L to promised (4) and forecast using the recent-5 demand regime for both mean and volatility so the OR backend targets a much lower base stock reflecting current low demand and the known lead time.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (concluded arrivals through Period 46); new recent low-demand regime: Periods 42\u201346 demands = [109,61,55,64,92], mean\u224876.2; on-hand=22 with in-transit=269 pending conclusion \u2014 recommend reduced ordering until demand strengthens or in-transit concludes.
