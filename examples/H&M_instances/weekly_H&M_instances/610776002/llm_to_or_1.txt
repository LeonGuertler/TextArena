Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. SKU 610776002 (women's basic T-shirt). Historical demands: [148,175,160,233,308], mean=204.8 \u2014 recent series shows rising tail but no clear changepoint with only 5 samples. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must cover current + lead periods. Promised lead time is 4 periods; no concluded arrivals to suggest a different actual lead time. Use default L to respect promised lead time and let OR backend infer actual lead-time from concluded arrivals. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from full sample (captures entire small-sample uncertainty). This balances service level (covering 5 periods of expected demand) versus holding cost given moderate holding penalty ($1 vs profit $2).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 (2019-02-18). Demand history mean=204.8 (samples [148,175,160,233,308]). On-hand=0, in-transit=314 (order placed Period 1 not yet arrived; arrival=0 in Period 1 conclude is expected given promised lead time=4). No concluded arrivals exist to infer a different lead time or losses. Use promised lead time and aggregate historical stats: keep L=default to trust promised 4-period lead time; use mu_hat default to set (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples so base-stock matches long-run mean demand over review+lead; use sigma_hat default to reflect observed demand variability scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances service level (profit $2 vs holding $1) using backend's newsvendor-derived z* while avoiding premature adjustments for a single nonarrival that is within expected lead time.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/2/25 (Period 3). Historical demand samples = [148,175,160,233,308] (mean 204.8). On-hand=0, in-transit=635 (equals orders 314+321 from Periods 1\u20132; no arrivals concluded yet). Promised lead time is 4 and we have no concluded arrivals to infer a different actual lead time, so use default lead time. Use default demand scaling ((1+L)\xd7mean) and default volatility (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR backend computes base stock and caps using full historical sample statistics while we await arrival confirmations. This keeps service-level focus given current zero on-hand and a large in-transit pipeline while avoiding premature adjustments for possible lost/delayed shipments.

Carry-over insight: Outstanding pipeline 635 units (orders from Periods 1 and 2) have not concluded; no evidence yet to change promised lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04 (Period 4). Recent on-site demand has risen vs. the older sample set (recent period demands: 266,316,306) and on-hand=0 with in-transit=980. Orders from Periods 1-3 have not concluded (arrivals=0), so no confirmed change in actual lead time yet. I keep L as default (promised lead time=4) because we have no concluded arrivals to infer a different lead time. For demand, I use the default aggregation ((1+L)\xd7mean of all historical samples) to let the OR engine combine the full-sample prior with its z* service-level calculation; this is conservative given the recent upward demand but avoids overreacting to a short run of high demands. For sigma_hat I also use default to let the backend scale variability by sqrt(1+L). These settings balance service level (capture higher mean via backend base_stock formula) while avoiding excessive inventory should some in-transit shipments be lost or delayed.

Carry-over insight: Outstanding pipeline increased to 980 units (in-transit=980) with no concluded arrivals for orders placed in Periods 1-3; no concluded evidence yet to change promised lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/11. Recent observed demands (game history) are high (266,316,306,283) and historical samples show mean ~204.8. On-hand=0, in-transit=1263 (many outstanding orders from Periods 1\u20134 with no concluded arrivals) \u2014 shipments appear overdue but there is no concluded arrival evidence to change promised lead time. Use default lead time (promised L=4) so OR backend assumes promised LT. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, which balances service level against holding cost given current uncertainty and avoids overcommitting while in-transit volume is already large. This keeps the policy conservative until we observe concluded arrivals or confirmed lead-time changes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $442.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18): on-hand=62, in-transit=971 (orders from Periods 2-5). History shows one concluded arrival: Period 5 conclude: arrived=314 (ordered Period 1, lead_time=4), which matches the promised lead time. No evidence of lead-time drift or demand regime change\u2014recent demands align with historical samples. To be conservative given large in-transit and matching observed lead time, use promised lead time and default demand aggregation so the OR backend uses full-sample mean/variance ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This maintains service while avoiding unnecessary extra inventory despite outstanding shipments.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). On-hand=113, in-transit=902. Historical concluded arrivals show orders from Period 1 and 2 had lead_time=4 (arrived in Periods 5 and 6). No concluded evidence of lead-time drift or lost shipments beyond those already noted. Use calculated L based on observed lead times (avg=4) to reflect confirmed lead time; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples (uses full-demand history [148,175,160,233,308]). This balances service (profit $2 vs holding $1) by letting OR compute base-stock from demand stats and the confirmed lead time.

Carry-over insight: Observed lead_time confirmed = 4 periods (Period1 and Period2 orders concluded with lead_time=4); maintain promised lead time until contrary concluded evidence appears.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). On-hand=94, in-transit=836. Concluded arrivals in Periods 5-7 confirm actual lead_time=4 for prior orders; no evidence to deviate from promised lead time. Use default estimators so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples), letting the OR backend compute base stock and cap while preserving service level given confirmed L=4 and current healthy pipeline.

LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08): on-hand=5, in-transit=921 (large pipeline). Historical concluded arrivals show orders from Periods 1-4 arrived with lead_time=4 \u2014 no evidence to deviate from promised L=4. Demand samples available are limited and no recent changepoint in demand mean/variance is evident; pipeline already covers multiple periods. Use default/statistical priors so the OR engine computes base_stock from full-sample mean/variance and promised lead time, avoiding manual tuning that could double-count the large in-transit volume.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). On-hand=0, in-transit=1283; past concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (evidence: Periods 5\u20138 concluded arrivals from Orders in Periods 1\u20134 with lead_time=4). Given confirmed LT=4 and large pipeline, use default lead time and default demand stats so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history; this keeps ordering aligned with observed demand history while the backend's capped ordering limits excess. No strong recent changepoint in demand mean/variance that warrants manual overrides.

LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22): demand has been high recently with several large concluded demands and current on-hand=0, in-transit=1145. Concluded arrivals for earlier orders consistently show actual lead_time = 4 periods; pipeline is large (1145) and no signs of lost shipments in concluded history. Use promised lead time to match observed actuals and let backend compute base-stock from full-sample mean/variance so orders are sized to cover (1+L) periods of demand given stable lead-time evidence.

Demand seed samples provided: [148,175,160,233,308]. Given confirmed lead time and no new regime signal in demand, use promised/default lead time and default demand/volatility calculations so backend computes base-stock from all samples. This keeps policy aligned with observed 4-period arrivals while letting OR engine balance service level vs holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=0, in-transit=1164. Concluded arrivals in history consistently show actual lead_time = 4 periods (orders from Periods 1\u20138 concluded with W=4); no evidence to deviate from promised lead time. Large pipeline currently covers many periods of demand; use promised/default lead time so OR backend uses established statistics. Select default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample set\u2014this balances service level vs holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019/05/13). Recent concluded history repeatedly confirms actual lead_time = 4 periods (conclusions in Periods 5\u201313). Historical demand samples mean \u2248204.8 units (samples [148,175,160,233,308]); (1+L)=5 \u2192 implied review+lead demand \u22481024. On-hand(80)+in-transit(1191)=1271, which covers ~6.2\xd7 mean demand (1271/204.8), so current pipeline is ample versus expected demand. Given strong concluded evidence for L=4 and ample pipeline, use default statistical estimates so the OR backend applies its base-stock formula with promised lead time while avoiding overreacting to transient noise or lost-order concerns.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time confirmed = 4 periods (observed arrivals from orders placed in Periods 1\u20139 concluded with lead_time=4); maintain promised lead time until contrary concluded evidence appears.

Pipeline is large but arrivals have matched promised L historically. Use promised lead time and population-based demand estimates (all-sample mean/std scaled by (1+L)) so OR backend computes base-stock from full-sample statistics; this balances service (large pipeline & confirmed L) against holding cost.

Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead_time=4 in earlier periods; no recent conclude messages contradicting promised lead time. Pipeline (1368) plus on-hand comfortably covers multiple future periods, so use promised lead time and default demand estimates (use full-sample mean-based mu_hat and std-based sigma_hat).

LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Recent concluded history consistently confirms actual lead time = 4 periods and demand samples show stable weekly demand (history supplied). On-hand = 758, in-transit = 808; pipeline appears healthy with no new lost-shipment evidence. Use default lead time and full-sample demand stats so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std to set base-stock and cap, balancing service level (profit $2 vs holding $1) without overreacting to short-term variability.

LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12): demand context shows sustained weekly demand volatility but recent concluded history consistently confirms actual lead time = 4 periods. On-hand=867 and in-transit=725 provide strong immediate coverage; no evidence of lost shipments. Use promised lead time (default) to match concluded arrivals.

LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Demand context: recent history shows steady weekly demand with higher variability in earlier weeks; concluded arrivals consistently confirm actual lead time = 4 periods. Current inventory: on-hand=999, in-transit=479 \u2014 healthy coverage. No evidence of lost shipments or lead-time drift; use promised lead time and default demand estimates (use all samples) so the OR backend applies standard base-stock sizing and caps.

LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). Recent concluded history consistently confirms actual lead time = 4 periods; demand has settled to moderate weekly volumes (recent on-hand high: 1046, in-transit 429). Pipeline + on-hand is ample vs. short-term demand so no aggressive replenishment needed. Use promised/default lead time to align with concluded evidence and let OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample set; this balances service level (profit $2 vs holding $1) while avoiding extra safety stock given large on-hand.

Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=1029, in-transit=419. Historical conclude messages consistently confirm actual lead time = 4 periods. No recent lost shipments or changepoint in demand; demand appears lower recently vs early spikes but not enough evidence to override default statistics. To avoid overreacting given large on-hand inventory, use default lead time and default demand statistics so the OR engine computes base stock from full-sample mean/SD. This keeps ordering conservative and avoids additional holding cost while respecting observed L=4.

LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28): on-hand=1001, in-transit=341. Historical conclude messages consistently confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (no contrary concluded evidence). Pipeline looks healthy with no persistent lost shipments. Use promised lead time and full-sample demand statistics so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples\u2014conservative, stable sizing that balances service level vs holding cost given high on-hand inventory.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). Recent demand has declined to ~78\u2013147 per week after a summer spike; current on-hand=1052, in-transit=303 \u2192 comfortable on-hand coverage. Historical concluded arrivals consistently confirm actual lead time = 4 periods; no new missed or delayed concludes to justify changing L. I select L=default to keep promised lead time (4) because concluded history supports it. Use mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xb7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xb7std from all historical demand samples, preserving statistical grounding and letting the capped ordering cap manage order size vs. holding cost.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019/11/11). On-hand=1077, in-transit=275. Historical concluded arrivals consistently confirm actual lead_time=4 periods; no evidence of lost shipments. Current inventory + pipeline is ample versus recent weekly demand (recent sold ~60\u2013150/week), so conservative/default statistical treatment is appropriate. I therefore keep L as promised (default) and use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the sample history; this balances service level with holding cost given confirmed lead time and healthy on-hand inventory.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019/11/18). Recent concluded history consistently shows actual lead_time = 4 periods; no evidence of lost shipments. On-hand = 1071, in-transit = 252 \u2014 ample cover versus typical demand. Use promised lead time to align with observed arrivals and the OR engine's assumptions. Demand seed available (samples [148,175,160,233,308]) is limited but shows moderate mean/variance; apply default aggregation so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std, keeping parameters simple and robust given ample on-hand stock and stable lead-time history.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). Current on-hand=1067, in-transit=239. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead_time = 4 periods; no evidence of lost shipments or lead-time regime change. Demand context: past demand samples seed = [148,175,160,233,308]; no recent changepoint detected that would justify deviating from default statistical estimates. To balance $2 profit vs $1 holding cost, use baseline estimates so the OR backend computes base_stock and cap using promised lead time and full-sample mean/variance; this avoids overreacting to short-term noise while keeping service level adequate given strong on-hand position.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=1049, in-transit=196. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods; no recent evidence of lost or shifted lead time. Inventory is healthy (on-hand covers multiple weeks of recent demand), so use default lead time and default demand estimators to let the OR engine compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history. This conservative choice maintains service while avoiding excess speculative orders given current high on-hand stock.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019/12/9). Recent history shows consistent concluded lead_time=4 periods across many arrivals; no evidence of lost shipments or lead-time shift. On-hand=1046, in-transit=233 \u2014 pipeline healthy and well above typical weekly demand, so maintain standard forecast aggregation. Use default lead time (promised L=4) and default demand/volatility calculations so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this keeps service levels aligned with profit/holding tradeoff while avoiding unnecessary extra stock given already-high on-hand inventory.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). Historical small-sample demand mean (provided seed samples [148,175,160,233,308]) supports baseline forecasting; concluded arrivals in history consistently show actual lead_time = 4 periods so use promised lead time. Current inventory: on-hand=1031, in-transit=236 \u2014 ample coverage versus recent demand levels, so avoid inflating forecasts. Choose L=default to keep lead time = promised (4). Use mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting the backend balance service level vs holding cost given current high on-hand stock and confirmed lead time.
