OR computed base-stock \u22481088 and cap \u2248314 and recommended 345 (uses promised L and historical stats). Recent realized demand (concluded): Period1 demand=266, Period2 demand=316 \u2192 recent average \u2248291, substantially above historical mean (204.8), signalling a demand uplift. Lead-time inference: No concluded arrivals yet for recent orders (expected later per promised L), so cannot deem shipments lost; treat in-transit=635 as available future supply arriving after promised lead time. Decision logic: With actual demand appearing higher (~291 per period), (L+1)=5 period coverage implies expected demand over replenishment horizon \u22485\xd7291=1,455 units. Target pipeline+on-hand+order should approach a base-stock near this horizon demand plus a modest safety buffer (OR's safety factor understates in current regime since it uses lower historical mean). Required order = target base-stock \u2212 pipeline = 1,455 \u2212 635 = 820. I round up slightly to cover variability and integer units, choosing 884 to more comfortably cover the demonstrated higher demand and avoid stockouts given long lead time. Trade-offs: This exceeds OR's capped recommendation because OR understates demand by using older mean; extra units incur holding cost $1/unit/period but profit $2/unit when sold \u2014 higher cost of stockouts vs holding favors stocking up now.
