Therefore treat supplier lead time as variable 1\u20133 and expect some risk of lost shipments.\nInventory & demand: On-hand=0, in-transit=755 (sum of outstanding orders). Use conservative target covering (L+1) periods of demand because decision occurs before arrivals and demand occurs this period.
