No overdue/lost shipments (in-transit=290 matches expected pipeline). d) Inventory/pipeline: on-hand=74 + in-transit=290 = 364 units available to cover future arrivals. Need to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand after decision. Using forecast ~90 units/period -> 5*90=450 required. Shortfall = 450 - 364 = 86 units. e) Order logic: place a modest safety/rounding buffer to avoid stockout given lead time variability and holiday noise.
