{
  "rationale": "a) World/calendar: Period 46 = 2019-12-23 (week of Christmas) could modestly lift apparel demand, but SKU is a basic women's T-shirt (no strong holiday-specific spike). b) Demand regime: recent observed demand since Period 21 has been low (~100\u2013180/week) and many weeks had zero sales due to stockouts; no new sustained demand increase is observed. c) Lead time / in-transit: history shows supplier lead_time inconsistent and often \u22652\u20133 periods; multiple prior orders (P3=526, P7=240, P12=624, P20=20) remain in-transit and sum to current in-transit=1410. d) Inventory/pipeline assessment: on-hand=0, in-transit=1410 \u2014 this large pipeline likely fulfills several weeks of expected demand even if arrivals are delayed; ordering now risks excess holding cost ($1/unit/period) if shipments arrive. e) Order logic: promised lead_time=2 but actual often 3; required pipeline cover = (L+1)=3 periods of demand. Given large outstanding in-transit and uncertain/long lead times, place no new order this period to avoid overstock/higher holding costs and to let in-transit shipments resolve.",

======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "World/calendar: Period 47 = 2019-12-30 (year-end). Possible small seasonal uplift around New Year, but recent December weekly demand has been low-to-moderate (Periods 36\u201346: [84,109,78,61,69,67,109,61,55,64,92], avg \u224879). Demand regime: sustained low-demand regime since Period 21 (carry-over insight) \u2014 no evidence of renewed high demand. Lead time / in-transit: In-transit=1410 corresponds to multiple outstanding orders (P3=526, P7=240, P12=624, P20=20) that remain overdue; supplier lead times are inconsistent and some shipments may be lost. Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0 but large in-transit stock likely will eventually arrive (uncertain timing). Cost trade-off: Profit = $4/unit, Holding = $1/unit/period \u2014 holding is material if large shipment arrives. Decision logic: Given large uncertain in-transit volume far exceeding expected short-term demand (3-period cover at ~80/week \u2248240), plus history of very long/unknown arrivals, avoid placing new orders now to prevent excess holding if shipments arrive; monitor next conclude for any arrivals before ordering.
