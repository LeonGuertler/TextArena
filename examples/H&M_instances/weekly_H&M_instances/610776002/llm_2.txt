{
  "rationale": "Calendar/world: Period 46 is 2019-12-23 (week of Christmas) \u2014 small short-term upside possible but SKU is basic T-shirt (not strongly seasonal). Demand regime: recent weekly demand is low (~55\u201364 in Periods 43\u201345); short-term mean \u224860. Lead time / pipeline: historical actual lead_time variable and many prior delayed shipments \u2014 in-transit should be treated as timing-unreliable. Inventory & costs: on-hand=1071 covers ~17 weeks at forecast ~60/week; holding cost = $1/unit/period is high relative to $2 profit. Ordering decision: avoid new orders given large on-hand, unreliable in-transit, and high holding cost; do not rely on in-transit until shipments formally conclude.",

============================================================
{
  "rationale": "World/calendar: Period 47 is 2019-12-30 (year-end/holiday lull); no product-specific seasonal spike expected for a basic women's T-shirt. Demand regime: recent weekly demand has been low/moderate (Periods 43\u201346 = 61,55,64,92) \u2014 estimate demand \u224880 units/week short-term. Lead time & pipeline: past history shows highly variable and often-delayed arrivals (observed lead_times 1\u20133 and many late/at-risk shipments); treat in-transit as unreliable unless concluded. Inventory assessment: on-hand=979 >> (L+1)\xd7forecast \u22483\xd780=240, so current on-hand comfortably covers required coverage even if in-transit never arrives. Cost tradeoff: profit $2/unit vs holding $1/unit/period \u2014 avoid adding inventory that will incur significant holding cost. Action: place no new order this period.",
