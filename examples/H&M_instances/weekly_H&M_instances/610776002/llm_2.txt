Risk: if actual lead_time>0, orders placed now may not arrive before demand in this period. Cost tradeoff: profit $4/unit vs holding $1/unit/period \u2014 high reward favors stocking to meet demand but avoid large overstock. Decision logic: target approximately the historical average demand for one period (~205) to maximize expected sales while limiting holding cost if some units carry over.
