Lead time confirmed = 4 periods; therefore plan must cover (L+1)=5 future periods of demand. Forecast demand \u224880 units \u2192 5-period requirement \u2248400 units. Current coverage: on-hand 218 + in-transit 200 = 418 units, which slightly exceeds the 5-period requirement and provides a small safety buffer. Holding cost is high relative to profit ($1 vs $2), so avoid excess inventory. No overdue/lost orders detected. Decision: place no new order this period to avoid unnecessary holding costs while current pipeline suffices to meet near-term demand.",
