Product is a women's basic lightweight jersey T-shirt \u2014 steady, everyday demand; no strong seasonal spike expected around Feb 14 (Valentine's) for this basic SKU. b) Demand regime: Use historical unified samples for SKU 610776002 = [148,175,160,233,308]. Sample mean = 204.8 units/period; no evidence yet of a regime shift in observed history. c) Lead time & missing orders: Supplier promised lead_time = 4 periods. No concluded arrivals in history to contradict promised lead time; in-transit=0 and no overdue orders. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, in-transit=0. With lead_time=L=4, we must cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand (current period demand will occur after the decision). e) Final order logic: Forecast ~205 units/period. Target pipeline = 205 * 5 = 1,025 units to cover periods N..N+4. Subtract on-hand and in-transit (0). Place an order for 1,025 units. This balances service (high expected demand) against holding cost; monitor future concluded arrivals to update lead-time or evidence of lost orders and adjust subsequent orders.",
