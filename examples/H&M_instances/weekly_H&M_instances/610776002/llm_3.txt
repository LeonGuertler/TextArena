Period 1 observed demand=266 (one higher-than-mean draw) but only a single period\u2014insufficient to declare a sustained shift. c) Lead time / orders: Supplier promised L=2. Order placed in Period 1 (615 units) has not concluded yet (arrived=0 in P1 conclude), which is consistent with promised 2-period lead time (would arrive during Period 3 and only be visible in a conclude message at Period 4).
