Historical unified samples for SKU 610776002 = [148,175,160,233,308], mean \u2248205 units/period; variability present but no confirmed regime shift. Promised lead time = 0, but actual lead time is unknown (no concluded arrivals yet); therefore assume supplier may deliver same period but be conservative about delays. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so to capture typical period demand and maximize profit (Profit $4/unit vs Holding $1/unit/period) we should stock roughly expected demand for one period. Ordering ~205 balances service level and holding cost while avoiding large overstock given lead-time uncertainty.",

Single-period uptick versus historical mean \u2014 possible variability but not yet a sustained shift. c) Lead time / arrivals: Period 1 conclude shows an order placed in P1 arrived in P1 (arrived=205, lead_time=0).
