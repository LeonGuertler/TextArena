Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11 (Period 1). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we start with no coverage. Historical demands: [148,175,160,233,308] (mean ~205). Promised lead time=4 periods and no concluded arrivals to suggest a different lead-time regime, so keep L at default. Use default demand estimation ((1+L)\xd7mean) and default volatility to let the OR engine compute base-stock and caps from full-sample statistics. This balances service (use all data) against holding cost given limited starting inventory and no evidence of demand regime shift or lost shipments.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). Recent demand samples = [148,175,160,233,308], mean=204.8. One large order (314) placed in Period 1 shows arrived=0 in Period 1 conclude (no concluded arrivals yet), so actual lead time is unknown but shipments may be delayed; however no concluded lead-time observations exist to revise L, so use promised lead time. Use default demand/volatility calculations so backend applies (1+L) scaling to the full-sample mean/std to set base stock and cap, balancing service level given profit=$2 vs holding=$1.

Carry-over insight: Period 1 order (314 units) has not concluded (arrived=0 when ordered on Period 1) \u2014 possible delayed or lost shipment; no concluded lead-time observed yet.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). Demand history samples = [148,175,160,233,308] (mean=204.8). On-hand=0, in-transit=635 (orders from Periods 1\u20132) but no concluded arrivals yet; earlier orders (Period 1 and 2) showed arrived=0 in their conclude messages, so actual lead time is unobserved and shipments may be delayed or lost. I keep L at the promised/default (do not infer a new lead-time without concluded evidence). Use default demand statistics so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample set\u2014this balances observed average demand with holding cost given modest sample size and no confirmed regime change. This conservative approach avoids overreacting to apparent lost shipments until a concluded lead-time can be computed.

Carry-over insight: Orders from Period 1 (314) and Period 2 (321) have not concluded (arrived=0 in their conclude messages) \u2014 possible delayed or lost shipments; no actual lead time yet.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (2019-03-04). On-hand=0, in-transit=980 (matches orders 314+321+345). No concluded arrivals yet \u2014 not overdue relative to promised L=4. Historical demand samples: [148,175,160,233,308], mean=204.8. Because there is no concluded evidence of extended lead time, use default lead time (promised=4). Use default demand aggregation and volatility ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR backend computes base_stock and cap from full-sample statistics. This balances service level (covering 5 periods of typical demand) while avoiding premature explicit adjustments for possible delays that are not yet confirmed.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). On-hand=0, in-transit=1263 = sum of orders from Periods 1-4; none have concluded (arrived=0 in conclude messages) so actual lead time is unknown and shipments appear delayed beyond the promised 4. To protect service while accounting for delayed arrivals, set lead time explicit to 5 (one period longer than promised). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes demand across review+lead using all historical samples (no clear demand regime change). This raises target base-stock modestly to cover current period plus extended lead exposure while relying on backend's capped order to limit over-ordering.

Carry-over insight: Delayed or missing arrivals: orders placed Periods 1-4 (314,321,345,283) remain un-concluded through Period 4 conclude; suspect lead-time >=5 or disrupted shipments.

Daily Profit: $504.00, Daily Holding Cost: $62.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $442.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent sell-through has been high (period demands: 266,316,306,283,252) and an earlier suspected shipment delay has partially resolved: Period 5 conclude shows Period 1 order (314) arrived with lead_time=4. This confirms actual lead time = 4 so far. On-hand=62, in-transit=1221 \u2014 pipeline is large but several recent orders still in-transit; expect demand to remain at recent elevated levels. I set L to default (promised 4) since concluded evidence matches promised lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the recent high-demand regime (use last 5 periods). For volatility I also use recent_N N=5 to reflect recent variability. These choices bias orders toward meeting the recent high demand while the OR backend will compute base-stock and cap using recent mean/std, reducing stockout risk given the large in-transit pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (Period 5 conclude: arrived=314 units ordered on Period 1, lead_time was 4). Previous multi-period non-conclusions likely reflected in-transit delays but not permanent loss.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019/3/25): recent concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 (Period5 conclude: arrived=314 ordered P1, lead_time=4; Period6 conclude: arrived=321 ordered P2, lead_time=4). Current on-hand=113, in-transit=1066 \u2014 pipeline large and recent arrivals explain recovered inventory. Use L='calculate' to set lead time to the observed average (captures confirmed 4-period regime). Demand forecasting: use default aggregate estimates (no strong evidence of demand regime change beyond historical samples provided), so mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' letting OR engine compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample set. This balances service (respect observed 4-period lead time) while avoiding overreacting to transient fluctuations given large pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (evidence: Period 5 conclude: arrived=314 units ordered on Period 1, lead_time=4; Period 6 conclude: arrived=321 units ordered on Period 2, lead_time=4).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

To be conservative and consistent with confirmed arrivals, use the promised/default lead time so the OR engine aligns with observed L=4. Use default demand estimates (mu_hat and sigma_hat) so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the provided historical samples; this leverages long-run demand stats while the confirmed lead time handles past delays. This balances service level (use full lead time) against holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/8 (Period 9). Recent concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (arrivals from Periods 1-4 concluded with lead_time=4). On-hand=5, in-transit=921 \u2014 pipeline is large and consistent with L=4. Historical sample set provided ([148,175,160,233,308]) shows no clear demand regime shift; recent observed demands (periods 5-8) are high but are already reflected in pipeline. I choose promised/default treatments: keep L at promised (default) since observed lead time matches promised; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample, letting the OR engine combine with profit/holding tradeoff. This balances service level (using confirmed L=4) against holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/15 (Period 10). Recent actual lead-time evidence shows consistent 4-period arrivals (Period 5 conclude: Period1\u2192arrived, lead_time=4; Period 6 conclude: Period2\u2192arrived, lead_time=4). On-hand=6, in-transit=1033 (pipeline ample). Demand has increased recently vs older samples \u2014 recent periods (Periods 5-9) demands = [252,270,364,372,271], mean \u2248305. To protect service given L\u22484 and elevated recent demand, set L via calculated average of observed lead-times, and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to focus the forecast/volatility on the new higher-demand regime. This balances higher target base-stock to avoid stockouts while keeping volatility estimation recent so cap limits prevent extreme over-ordering.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (evidence: Period 5 conclude: arrived=314 units ordered on Period 1, lead_time=4; Period 6 conclude: arrived=321 units ordered on Period 2, lead_time=4).

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). Recent conclude messages consistently confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (Period 5-7/10 conclues show arrivals from orders placed 4 periods earlier). On-hand=0, in-transit=1268 (pipeline covers multiple lead cycles). I set L to default (promised lead time = 4) because observed concluded lead times match the promise. Demand history (samples [148,175,160,233,308]) is limited and shows no recent structural shift in mean/variance, so use default aggregation: mu_hat and sigma_hat set to default so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples. This keeps the base-stock calculation aligned with confirmed lead-time and avoids overfitting to short-term noise while ensuring pipeline + orders target cover the (L+1)-period demand horizon.

Recent demand has risen (last 5 demands = [364,372,271,310,564], mean\u2248376). To cover review+lead (L+1=5) periods and reflect higher recent demand, use L=default (promised=4), mu_hat based on the most recent 5 demands, and sigma_hat estimated from the same recent window so variability reflects the recent regime. This increases target base-stock to sustain service through the elevated demand while the large in-transit volume (1295) will be accounted for by the OR engine.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (evidence: multiple 'arrived' conclude messages showing lead_time=4 for orders from Periods 1-7); recent demand regime elevated (last 5-period mean \u2248376 demand/week).

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/6 (Period 13). Recent conclues consistently confirm actual lead time = 4 periods and demand has been elevated recently (5-period mean \u2248376 units). On-hand=0, in-transit=1489. Using promised/default lead time=4 is consistent with observed conclues. Forecasting demand with the recent 5-period regime captures the elevated demand; using recent_N for sigma matches volatility in the same window. This configuration signals the OR engine to target (1+L) periods of the recent higher mean while sizing safety stock to recent variability; note pipeline (1489) is below (1+L)*recent_mean so orders will be required to cover the next (L+1) demand horizon.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13 (Period 14). Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (orders from Periods 1\u20139 concluded with lead_time=4). Recent demand has shifted upward: the last 5 concluded-period demands (Periods 9\u201313 = 271, 310, 564, 424, 304) have mean \u2248374.6, indicating a higher demand regime. On-hand=80 with in-transit=1668 (large pipeline) \u2014 preserve promised lead time = 4 so the OR backend aligns with observed arrivals. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the elevated recent demand (forecast across review+lead period = (1+L)*recent mean). Use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility and allow the backend to size safety stock appropriately. This balances higher service-level needs from elevated demand while relying on the large in-transit pipeline to limit immediate extra ordering.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). Recent concluded history consistently shows actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple arrived messages with lead_time=4). On-hand=50, in-transit=1509. Demand has risen recently (last 5-week mean \u2248376), so I increase forecast horizon to reflect the elevated regime. L set to promised (default=4) because concluded messages confirm 4-period lead time. mu_hat uses recent_N (N=5) to capture the elevated recent mean demand across the review+lead period. sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=5) to capture recent volatility. These settings keep the backend\u2019s base-stock responsive to the higher demand while respecting observed lead-time stability and the large in-transit pipeline (mitigates understock risk from delayed arrivals).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:

Recent demand regime elevated \u2014 last 5 concluded demands (Periods 11-15) average \u2248376/week with high variance and several stockouts. To align the OR engine's base-stock with the observed lead time and elevated recent demand, set L using observed lead times (calculate) and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 demand samples to capture the new higher mean and volatility. This ensures pipeline coverage for (1+L) periods based on current realized lead time and raises forecasted demand to reduce future stockouts while acknowledging holding cost via the OR cap.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple arrived=... lead_time=4). On-hand=127 and in-transit=1692 \u2014 pipeline ample vs. elevated recent demand. Demand has shifted up recently (last 5-period mean \u2248376/week).

Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new higher-demand regime and recent volatility so the OR engine sizes base-stock to cover (1+L) review+lead demand under current regime.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (evidence: multiple 'arrived' conclude messages showing lead_time=4 for orders from Periods 1-12). Recent demand regime elevated: last 5-period mean \u2248376 demand/week (Periods 12-16), adjust forecasts/volatility accordingly.

Recent demand regime is elevated (last 5-period mean \u2248376 units/week, higher volatility). To match realized lead time and recent demand shift, set L to promised (4) and use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility from the most recent regime. This keeps service levels aligned to higher recent demand while limiting holding given high holding cost.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). Recent history shows consistent concluded arrivals implying actual lead time = promised 4 periods. On-hand=147 + in-transit=1550 => ample pipeline but demand has risen recently (volatile). Use lead time = promised to keep OR engine aligned with system assumptions. For demand I choose recent_N (N=5) to capture the elevated recent regime and its volatility so the base-stock and caps reflect current higher mean and variation. This balances service (avoid stockouts given high recent demand) against holding cost by limiting lookback to recent 5 periods rather than full-history smoothing.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple concluded arrivals showing lead_time=4 for orders from Periods 1-16); recent demand regime elevated \u2014 last 5-period mean \u2248447 units (Periods 16-20: 435,640,419,439,301).

Recent demand has been elevated and volatile (last 5-periods average ~447 as noted in carry-overs). Given confirmed lead time=4 and no evidence of lost shipments, use the promised/default lead time so OR backend aligns with observed behavior. Use default demand/statistics so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples \u2014 this keeps forecasting stable while the backend's capped ordering will limit excessive orders despite high pipeline.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22). On-hand=1015, in-transit=648. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods. Recent demand has been elevated (multiple periods with high sales; e.g. periods 16-20 mean \u2248447). To keep policy aligned with observed lead time and use full-sample demand statistics while avoiding overfitting to short noise, set L=default (promised lead time=4), mu_hat=default (use (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples), sigma_hat=default (use sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples). This provides the OR backend a stable base-stock anchored to full-sample demand while the confirmed L=4 ensures orders cover the correct pipeline horizon given large on-hand+p ipeline.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019/7/29 (Period 25). Concluded history consistently shows actual lead time = 4 periods; on-hand=808, in-transit=725 supports short-term coverage. Recent demand has slowed from the mid-June spike; using the most recent 5-period demand regime captures the latest demand level and volatility. Set L to promised/default (4) because concluded arrivals repeatedly confirm LT=4. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)\xd7recent mean and volatility, preventing over-ordering from earlier spikes while preserving service given current pipeline.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019/8/5 (Period 26). Actual lead time has been repeatedly confirmed as 4 periods in concluded messages. On-hand=1302, in-transit=77 \u2014 ample inventory now vs recent low demand. Recent demand regime shows a material downward shift: last 5 periods (Periods 21-25) demands = [232,238,212,207,154], mean \u2248208.6. To avoid overstock while respecting confirmed L=4, set L to default (use promised lead time), set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to anchor to the recent lower demand regime across the review+lead period, and keep sigma_hat as default to let backend compute volatility from full history scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances service level with holding cost given large on-hand inventory and lower recent demand.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple concluded arrivals, latest through Period 25). Recent demand regime downshift: Periods 21-25 mean \u2248208.6 (evidence: demands 232,238,212,207,154).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=1200, in-transit=77. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple arrivals with lead_time=4 across Periods 5\u201325), so use observed lead-time. Recent demand regime has downshift (Periods 21\u201325 mean \u2248208.6) and current inventory is high; no aggressive replenishment required. Choose L by calculating average observed lead times (reflecting confirmed lead_time=4). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7sample mean/std across history (conservative given high on-hand) and lets the capped ordering cap constrain new orders. This addresses past delayed arrivals (now confirmed as L=4) and avoids over-ordering into elevated holding cost.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods from multiple concluded arrivals. Inventory strong: on-hand=1080, in-transit=463 -> large pipeline. Recent demand regime shows a downshift (Periods 21-25 mean \u2248208.6). To reflect confirmed L=4 and recent lower demand, set L to default (promised = 4) and use a recent-N demand estimate (focus on latest regime) with N=5. Keep sigma_hat as default (use full-sample volatility scaled by \u221a(1+L)). This reduces target base-stock to match the recent lower demand while the large on-hand stock limits urgent ordering.

Carry-over insight: Recent sustained demand downshift: Periods 21-25 mean \u2248208.6 (demands 232,238,212,207,154); confirmed lead time = 4 periods from multiple concluded arrivals.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26 (Period 29). Historical concludes repeatedly confirm actual lead time = 4 periods. On-hand=999 and in-transit=386 => strong coverage; no urgent replenishment needed. Recent demand appears to have downshifted vs earlier elevated regime; last 5-period demands (Periods 24-28 = 207,154,102,120,158) average ~148.2. To reflect the recent regime while keeping L aligned with confirmed behavior, set L=default (promised=4), use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to forecast (1+L)\xd7recent mean, and recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. This reduces overstock risk given high on-hand and lower current demand.

Carry-over insight: Recent sustained demand downshift: Periods 24-28 mean \u2248148.2 (demands 207,154,102,120,158); confirmed lead time = 4 periods from multiple concluded arrivals.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). Actual lead time repeatedly confirmed = 4 periods in conclude history, so use promised/default L. Recent sustained demand downshift \u2014 last 5 periods (Periods 25-29 demands 154,102,120,158,140) show a lower mean (~134.8) and lower volatility versus earlier regime; therefore set demand estimators to recent_N with N=5 to align base-stock to the current lower demand. Current coverage: on-hand 859 + in-transit 386 = 1245 units, which provides cushion vs a 5-period forecast but using recent_N limits over-ordering and holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple concluded arrivals across history); recent sustained demand downshift: Periods 25-29 mean \u2248134.8 (demands 154,102,120,158,140).

Recent demand has downshifted: last 5 periods (Periods 30-34) demands = [145,141,135,147,106], mean \u2248134.8. On-hand=571 + in-transit=837 provides healthy pipeline coverage, but we must set forecasts to reflect the recent lower regime. Choose L=default (promised lead time=4) since concluded history supports LT=4. Set mu_hat=recent_N with N=5 to forecast (1+L)\xd7mean of the most recent 5 demands (captures the recent downshift). Set sigma_hat=recent_N with N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices reduce overstock risk while preserving service given confirmed LT and current ample pipeline.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-14 (Period 36). Actual lead time repeatedly confirmed = 4 periods in concluded history; on-hand=486, in-transit=837 so pipeline is healthy. Demand has shifted down recently: last 5 observed demands (Periods 31-35) = [141,135,147,106,85], recent mean \u2248122.8. I set L to default (use promised lead time = 4). For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the recent sustained downshift; same recent_N (N=5) for sigma to reflect lower recent volatility. These parameters reduce target base-stock and cap inventory accumulation given high pipeline and lower recent demand, lowering holding costs while maintaining service under the confirmed L=4.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed lead time = 4 periods (multiple concluded arrivals across history); recent sustained demand downshift: Periods 31-35 mean \u2248122.8 (141,135,147,106,85).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21 (Period 37). Historical conclude messages consistently confirm actual lead time = 4 periods. Recent demand has downshifted vs earlier spikes and current on-hand (899) + in-transit (340) = 1,239 units provides strong coverage vs recent weekly demand (~85\u2013147 recently). To keep the OR backend aligned with observed lead time and full-sample demand statistics, use default lead time and default demand moments so the engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This avoids overreacting to short-term noise while the pipeline remains well stocked, balancing service level and holding cost.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/10/28 (Period 38). Recent demand has trended down from earlier elevated regime; last 5 periods (Periods 33-37) demand = [147,106,85,84,109], indicating a lower demand regime (mean \u2248106). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods across concluded arrivals \u2014 no evidence to deviate from promised lead time. On-hand=790 + in-transit=552 gives ample pipeline coverage; choose conservative short-horizon forecast to avoid excess holding cost while maintaining service. Set L to default (use promised 4). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current downshift in mean and volatility based on the most recent 5 demands.

Carry-over insight: New sustained demand downshift: Periods 33-37 mean \u2248106.2 (demands 147,106,85,84,109); confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods from multiple concluded arrivals.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). Demand has recently downshifted vs earlier spikes; confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods from concluded arrivals. On-hand=1052 + in-transit=212 provides strong coverage today; pipeline not overdue. Use promised lead time (default) since concluded history consistently shows L=4. Set demand forecast to a recent-window estimate to capture the sustained downshift (avoid overstating demand from older high periods). Methods: L=default (promised L=4); mu_hat=recent_N with N=5 to base (1+L)\xd7mean on the most recent 5 demands (Periods 34-38) so the base-stock reflects the lower recent demand; sigma_hat=recent_N with N=5 to capture recent volatility and keep safety stock aligned with current variability. These parameters reduce excess holding while maintaining service given ample on-hand + in-transit.

Carry-over insight: Recent sustained demand downshift: Periods 34-38 mean = 92.4 units/week (demands 106,85,84,109,78); confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods from multiple concluded arrivals.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). Lead-time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods in concluded history. On-hand=991, in-transit=212 \u2014 ample cover today. Recent demand shows a sustained downshift; last 5 realized weekly demands (Periods 35-39) = [85,84,109,78,61], mean \u224883.4 and lower variance than earlier regimes. I set L to promised (default = 4) because concluded arrivals show stable 4-period lead time. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to reflect the new low-demand regime ((1+L)-period forecast and volatility derived from the most recent 5 observations). This reduces target base-stock and inventory risk while preserving service given the confirmed lead time.

Carry-over insight: Recent sustained demand downshift: Periods 35-39 mean \u224883.4 (demands 85,84,109,78,61); confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods from multiple concluded arrivals.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/18 (Period 41). History shows confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods across many concluded arrivals; on-hand=922, in-transit=212. Recent demand has shifted down: last 5 demands (Periods 36-40) = [84,109,78,61,69], mean \u224880.2 and lower volatility than long-run. To avoid overstock while preserving service with L=4, set lead time to promised (default) and use recent_N (N=5) for demand mean and volatility so the OR engine sizes base stock to current low-demand regime and tighter uncertainty band. This reconciles pipeline + on-hand: large on-hand (922) already covers multiple weeks, so using recent demand prevents aggressive replenishment.

No overdue/lost shipments outstanding (arrivals visible up through Period 41). Use promised/confirmed L=4 to align pipeline timing. Use default demand/volatility estimation so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples, yielding a conservative base-stock that balances service (profit $2 vs holding $1) with currently ample on-hand stock.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). Historical conclude messages consistently confirm actual lead time = 4 periods. Recent demand has downshifted: last 5 observed demands (Periods 38-42) = [78,61,69,67,109], mean \u2248 76.8, much lower than earlier regimes. On-hand (958) + in-transit (287) = 1,245 units \u2014 ample cover versus the low recent demand; avoid overstock by using a recent-window forecast. Choose L=default to keep promised lead time (4) which matches confirmed arrivals. Use mu_hat recent_N N=5 to base the (1+L)-period demand forecast on the last 5 low-demand samples. Use sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to reflect reduced recent volatility. This keeps base-stock small, reduces holding cost exposure while preserving service given long history of lead_time=4 and current high on-hand balance.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple conclude messages across history). Recent sustained demand downshift: Periods 38-42 demands = [78,61,69,67,109], 5-period mean \u224876.8 \u2014 use recent-window forecasting.

To reflect the recent lower-demand regime I set mu_hat using a recent_N=5 window so the backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 5 samples.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). Recent demand has downshifted \u2014 last 5 demands (Periods 40-44) = [69,67,109,61,55], 5-period mean \u224872.2. On-hand=842, in-transit=287 (pipeline healthy). Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods. Given stable evidence of L=4 and a clear recent lower-demand regime, I set lead time to reflect observed behavior and use recent-window forecasts (5 periods) for mu and sigma to capture the current low-variance regime. This keeps base stock aligned with current demand (reduces excess holding cost) while pipeline is large enough to cover lead time demand; using recent_N reduces overweighting older high-volume weeks and prevents unnecessary ordering while arrivals continue to be reliable (no lost shipments recently).

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods from multiple concluded arrivals; recent sustained demand downshift \u2014 last 5 periods (Periods 40-44) mean \u224872.2 (demands [69,67,109,61,55]).

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/30 (Period 47). On-hand=973, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages consistently confirm actual lead time = 4 periods. Recent demand has downshifted; last 5 realized demands (Periods 42-46 = 109,61,55,64,92) average \u224876.2. To align forecasts to the current low-demand regime and keep inventory from growing, set L to promised/default (4) and use a recent-5 window for demand mean and volatility so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the reduced demand.
