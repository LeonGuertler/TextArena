Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. No on-hand or in-transit inventory; no concluded arrivals to infer actual lead time. Historical demands = [148,175,160,233,308], mean=204.8, no clear recent changepoint and sample size small. Use promised lead time (default) since no concluded lead-time observations. Use default demand/volatility calculations so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from full sample; this balances service (captures observed demand level) and holding cost conservatively given limited evidence and zero pipeline.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent demand samples = [148,175,160,233,308] (mean=204.8). On-hand=0, in-transit=314 from Period 1 order (arrived=0 in Period 1 conclude) \u2014 no concluded arrivals yet so actual lead time is unconfirmed. Use promised lead time (default) to avoid overfitting to an unconfirmed delay. Demand forecast and uncertainty use full-sample defaults so the OR backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples), balancing service level against holding cost given current pipeline.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/2/25. On-hand=0, in-transit=321. History shows an order placed Period 1 arrived in Period 2 with lead_time=1 (Period2 conclude). This implies actual lead time = 1 period (observed). I set L to be computed from observed lead times so the OR backend uses actual experienced lead time. Demand history mean = 204.8 from samples [148,175,160,233,308]; I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using the chosen L. This keeps the base-stock anchored to recent demand while the inferred shorter lead time reduces required pipeline cover and holding cost risk given current in-transit units.

Carry-over insight: Observed lead time = 1 period (Period2 conclude: arrived=314 ordered on Period1, lead_time was 1).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent demand samples [148,175,160,233,308] show elevated mean (~205) and variability. On-hand=0, in-transit=502 (covers upcoming demand). Period2 concluded an observed lead time of 1 period for an order placed in Period1; no other concluded lead times. I set L to 'calculate' so the backend uses the average observed lead time (captures the 1-period evidence). I select default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this balances service level against holding cost given the shorter inferred lead time and existing in-transit stock.

Carry-over insight: Observed lead time = 1 period (Period2 conclude: arrived=314 ordered on Period1, lead_time was 1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/11. Recent concludes show arrivals from Period1 arriving with lead_time=1 in Period2 and again observed lead_time=1 (Periods 3\u20134 conclude messages), indicating actual lead time has shortened from promised 2\u21921. On-hand=0, in-transit=521 (some shipments outstanding). Set L via 'calculate' to use observed lead times. Demand has jumped recently (period demands: 266,316,306,283); use recent_N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the forecast and volatility reflect the higher recent demand regime and produce a larger base-stock to avoid stockouts given shorter lead time and substantial in-transit. This balances higher service level (profit > holding cost) against holding cost by relying on recent demand samples rather than long-term lower historical mean.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/18 (Period 6). On-hand=69, in-transit=279 (total pipeline 348). History shows mixed lead-time evidence: observed lead_times = 1 (Period2 conclude) and 3 (Period5 conclude). This suggests variable / shifted lead times rather than consistent promised L=2; average observed lead time = 2. I select L by 'calculate' to let backend use observed lead-times average. Demand history mean=204.8; I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as 'default' so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using the chosen L, providing a conservative replenishment (covers review+lead demand) while letting the OR engine cap orders to limit inventory risk given holding cost. This balances higher service from longer inferred lead time against holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Lead time regime is variable: observed lead_times {1,3} \u2192 average 2; shipments show delays/variability (evidence: Period2 conclude lead_time=1; Period5 conclude lead_time=3).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). On-hand=0, in-transit=441. Observed lead-times from concluded history: 1 (P2 conclude), 3 (P5 conclude), 2 (P6 conclude) \u2192 average 2. Shipments have been variable/delayed; using an L estimate based on observed average captures this variability. I choose L="calculate" to set lead time = average observed (2). Demand forecast uses the full-sample default ((1+L)\xd7mean of all past demand samples) to avoid overreacting to recent noise; sigma uses default to scale variability by sqrt(1+L). These parameters increase pipeline cover for the longer/variable lead times while keeping safety stock aligned with historical demand variance to balance service level vs holding cost.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. On-hand=0, In-transit=532. Recent demands high and variable (history demands: [266,316,306,283,252,270,364]; past sample seed [148,175,160,233,308]). Multiple concluded lead-time observations show variability (1,3,2 \u2192 average ~2). Use lead-time inferred from observed concludes (calculate) so OR backend captures variable regime; keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so backend uses full-sample mean/std scaled by (1+L), balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime variable; observed lead_times from concludes = {1,3,2} \u2192 average \u22482 (evidence: Period2 conclude lead_time=1; Period5 conclude lead_time=3; Period6 conclude lead_time=2).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). Recent concluded lead-times = {1,3,2} (avg \u22482) indicating a variable/longer lead-time regime vs promised 2; several shipments were delayed but not lost. On-hand=0, in-transit=295 which is likely insufficient vs multi-period demand. I set L to be inferred from observed concludes (average) to capture variable lead-time behavior. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (all-sample statistics scaled by (1+L)) so the OR engine produces a base-stock that balances service (higher L raises required cover) against holding cost given profit=$2/hold=$1.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). Recent demand is high and volatile with repeated stockouts (recent period sales often zero due to no on-hand). On-hand=0, in-transit=575 \u2014 pipeline present but past concludes show variable/extended lead times (arrivals delayed or spread). Use L='calculate' so backend infers average observed lead time from concluded history (captures variable regime ~2). Use mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' so backend scales demand mean/variance by (1+L) consistently; this balances service (higher base-stock when L larger) versus holding cost while letting backend apply its capped order cap.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime variable; observed lead_times from concludes = {1,3,2} \u2192 average \u22482 (evidence: Period2 conclude lead_time=1; Period5 conclude lead_time=3; Period6 conclude lead_time=2). Shipments show delays/variability.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). On-hand=0, in-transit=276. Concluded arrivals show variable lead-times (observed W={1,3,2,3,2} \u2192 avg\u22482) and several delayed shipments; therefore use an L estimate that reflects observed variability. Demand has trended up recently (large demands in Periods 7\u201311, including a spike 564 in P11). To capture the recent higher demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 periods. These choices (L by calculate; mu_hat recent_N N=5; sigma_hat recent_N N=5) let the OR backend size base-stock for the longer/variable effective lead time and raise forecast mean and volatility to reduce stockouts while accepting holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Recent demand regime shift upward: last 5-period mean ~376 (Periods 7\u201311 demands {364,372,271,310,564}) \u2014 treat as new higher-demand regime; lead-time regime remains variable with average \u22482 (evidence: concluded lead_times = {1,3,2,3,2}).

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=0, in-transit=822. Concluded lead times show variability (observed W={1,3,2,3,2} \u2192 avg \u22482) and recent demand has shifted up (Periods 7\u201311 demands = {364,372,271,310,564}, 5-period mean \u2248376). To reflect the variable lead-time regime use calculated average lead time from observed concludes. For demand forecast use the most recent 5-period regime (captures the upward shift) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend sizes base-stock to cover the higher recent demand and measured volatility while capping orders via its cap rule.

Carry-over insight: Recent demand regime shift upward: Periods 7\u201311 mean \u2248376 (evidence: demands 364,372,271,310,564). Lead-time regime variable with observed concludes {1,3,2,3,2} \u2192 average \u22482; shipments show delays/variability.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/13. Recent demand regime is higher: last 5 observed demands (Periods 9\u201313) average \u2248374. On-hand=0, in-transit=847 (pipeline large but arrivals may be delayed per history). Lead times observed from concludes = {1,3,2,3,2} average \u22482.2, so set L to be calculated from observed concludes. For demand forecasting use recent_N (N=5) to capture the new higher-demand regime ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 samples). Volatility has increased with the regime shift; use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat so safety stock reflects recent variance. These choices let the backend raise base-stock and safety stock to serve higher demand while accounting for variable lead time and pipeline uncertainty.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20 (Period 15). Recent demand has shifted up (notable high demands in Periods 7\u201311) while shipments show variable lead-times and delays (concluded lead_times = {1,3,2,3,2,3} \u2192 avg \u22482.33). On-hand=0, in-transit=843 (large pipeline but arrival timing uncertain). I set L to 'calculate' to reflect observed variable lead-time regime average from concluded messages. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the new higher-demand regime (Periods 7\u201311 mean \u2248376) so mu_hat = (1+L)*recent mean. For sigma_hat I use recent_N (N=5) to reflect increased recent volatility. These choices increase target base-stock to meet elevated recent demand while using observed lead-time average to hedge against delayed arrivals and lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Recent demand regime shifted up: Periods 7\u201311 mean \u2248376 (demands 364,372,271,310,564); lead-time regime variable with observed concluded lead_times {1,3,2,3,2,3} \u2192 average \u22482.33; shipments show repeated delays/variability.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/27 (Period 16). Recent demand has shifted up materially: latest 5 demands (Periods 11\u201315) = {564,424,304,431,442} -> mean \u2248433. Lead times have been variable with concluded observations = {1,3,2,3,2,3,2} -> average \u22482.29; shipments show repeated delays/variability and some late arrivals. To cover the uncertain lead-time regime use the empirically estimated average lead time (calculate) rather than the promised default. For demand forecasting use a recent-window mean to capture the new higher-demand regime (recent_N, N=5). Volatility should reflect recent variability (recent_N, N=5). These choices increase target base-stock to reduce stockouts under higher demand and variable arrivals while sigma from recent data informs safety stock sizing to balance profit vs holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Recent demand regime shift upward: Periods 11\u201315 mean \u2248433 (demands 564,424,304,431,442); lead-time regime remains variable with observed concluded lead_times {1,3,2,3,2,3,2} -> average \u22482.29; shipments show repeated delays/variability.

Concluded lead-times show variability (observed values across concludes average \u22482+), so use calculated average lead time to reflect recent delivery variability. Demand has shifted up recently; use a recent-window forecast to capture the higher regime. Choices: L=calculate to average observed lead-times; mu_hat=recent_N with N=5 to capture last 5-period demand regime; sigma_hat=recent_N with N=5 to reflect recent demand volatility. These settings let the OR backend size the base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of elevated demand while accounting for increased variability and uncertain arrivals.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). Recent concluded history shows variable lead times (observed W = {1,3,2,3,2,3,2,1} \u2192 avg \u22482.125) and a clear upward demand regime in recent periods. I set L to be calculated from observed concludes to capture the variable lead-time regime. For demand I use a recent_N window (N=7, Periods 11\u201317 demands = {564,424,304,431,442,435,640}) to reflect the new higher-demand regime; sigma_hat also uses the same recent_N to capture recent volatility. These choices bias orders upward to cover the longer/variable effective lead time and higher recent demand while letting the OR backend compute safety stock consistent with profit/holding tradeoffs.

Carry-over insight: Recent sustained demand increase: Periods 11\u201317 mean \u2248462.9 (demands {564,424,304,431,442,435,640}); Lead-time regime variable with observed concluded lead_times avg \u22482.125 (observed W = {1,3,2,3,2,3,2,1}).

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-17 period19. On-hand=0, in-transit=992. Historical concluded lead_times = {1,3,2,3,2,3,2,1} (avg=2.125). Recent demand elevated (Periods 11\u201317 mean \u2248462.9) \u2014 demand regime sustained higher than earlier samples. Choose L='calculate' to let backend use observed average lead time from concludes (captures variable/lengthened lead-times). Use mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' so backend scales mean and std by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L) respectively, leveraging full-sample stats while accounting for inferred lead time; this balances higher service needs from elevated demand against holding cost given profit/holding=$2/$1.

Carry-over insight: Recent sustained demand increase: Periods 11\u201317 mean \u2248462.9 (demands {564,424,304,431,442,435,640}); lead-time regime variable with observed concluded lead_times avg \u22482.125 (observed W = {1,3,2,3,2,3,2,1}).

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24. On-hand=0, in-transit=923. Historical concludes show variable lead-times (observed W = {1,3,2,3,2,3,2,1,3} across concludes) averaging ~2 \u2014 shipments repeatedly delayed/variable. Demand has shifted up recently: last 7 periods (Periods 13\u201319) demands = {304,431,442,435,640,419,439}, mean \u2248434.9, higher than earlier history. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the empirical average observed lead-times rather than the promised value to reflect variability. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N with N=7 to anchor forecast and volatility to the new higher-demand regime (covers review+lead period via backend scaling). This increases target base-stock to reduce stockouts given longer/variable lead times while using recent volatility to size safety stock and cap constraints, balancing service vs holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Recent sustained demand increase: Periods 13\u201319 mean \u2248434.9 (demands {304,431,442,435,640,419,439}); Lead-time regime remains variable with observed concluded lead_times averaging \u22482 (evidence: concluded W includes {1,3,2,3,2,3,2,1,3}).

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). On-hand=0, in-transit=949. Concluded history shows variable actual lead times (observed W = {1,3,2,3,3,2,1,3}, avg \u22482.25) and a sustained upward demand regime in recent periods (Periods 13\u201319 mean \u2248434.9). To reflect variable/longer realized lead times, set L to be calculated from observed concludes. For demand, use a recent-window forecast to capture the higher-demand regime (recent_N over most recent regime (Periods 13\u201319), N=7). Use the same recent window for demand volatility (sigma_hat) so safety stock scales to recent variability. These settings balance service (higher mu_hat and sigma_hat to meet increased demand and variable lead times) against holding cost by limiting the window to the detected recent regime rather than all historical samples.

Carry-over insight: Recent sustained demand increase: Periods 13\u201319 mean \u2248434.9 (demands {304,431,442,435,640,419,439}); lead-time regime variable with observed concluded lead_times averaging \u22482.25 (W={1,3,2,3,3,2,1,3}).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Historical concluded lead_times show variability (observed W = {1,3,2,3,2,3,2,1,3,3}, average \u22482.3) so use calculate to let backend use observed average. Recent demand has been elevated; last 6 realized demands (Periods 16\u201321 = 435,640,419,439,301,232) average \u2248411 \u2014 use recent_N with N=6 to capture the current higher-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. Using recent demand and observed lead-time average raises the base-stock target to improve service while sigma estimated from recent variability tightens safety stock. In-transit=844 will be counted by the OR engine when computing pipeline; chosen settings balance higher service level against holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-15 (Period 23). Recent history shows a sustained uplift in demand over the last 7 periods (Periods 16\u201322) with mean \u2248386 units and high variability; concluded shipments show a variable lead-time regime (observed W values average \u22482\u20132.3). On-hand is 0, in-transit=908 (pipeline large). To reflect observed variable lead time I let the backend compute average observed lead time from concludes (method='calculate'). For demand I use a recent_N window (N=7) to capture the recent higher-demand regime when forming (1+L)\xd7mean. For volatility I also use recent_N N=7 to reflect current higher variance. These choices bias orders toward meeting the higher recent demand while the backend cap will limit excessive single-period orders given the large pipeline and holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Recent sustained higher-demand regime (Periods 16\u201322 mean \u2248386); lead-time regime remains variable with observed concluded lead-times averaging \u22482\u20132.3 (evidence: multiple concluded lead_times = {1,3,2,3,2,3,2,1,3}).

LLM Rationale:

Concluded arrivals show variable lead-times with observed values {1,3,2,3,2,3,2,1,3,3} \u2192 mean \u22482.3, so use calculated average lead time to capture variability. Demand has recently shifted up; I use a recent_N demand estimate (N=7, covering Periods 17\u201323) to reflect the higher recent regime when forecasting across review+lead period. Volatility also updated using recent_N (N=7) to capture recent demand variability. These settings (calculate L; recent demand mean and std over last 7 periods) steer the OR backend toward a higher base-stock to maintain service under variable multi-period lead times while avoiding excessive long-tail holding by using only the recent regime.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=0, in-transit=908. Historical concluded lead-times are variable (multiple concludes with W={1,3,2,3,2,3,2,1,3}) \u2014 use average inferred from concludes. Recent demand has shifted versus early history; I use a recent-window forecast to capture the current regime while avoiding stale early samples. Chosen methods: L='calculate' to let backend average observed lead times; mu_hat='recent_N' with N=7 to forecast (1+L)\xd7mean over the last 7 demand observations; sigma_hat='recent_N' with N=7 to estimate volatility from the same recent window. This balances higher recent demand signal against variable lead-times and limits overstock given $1 holding cost and $2 profit.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime remains variable with observed concluded lead_times averaging \u22482 (evidence: concluded W includes {1,3,2,3,2,3,2,1,3}); treat recent-demand as higher than earliest-history\u2014use recent-window forecasts.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). On-hand=0, in-transit=844. Concluded arrivals show variable lead-times; average of observed concluded lead_times \u22482.36, so use calculated average to capture variability. Recent demand has fallen vs earlier spikes; use a recent-window (last 6 periods, Periods 21\u201326) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current lower-demand regime (mean \u2248190.8, lower volatility). These settings steer the OR backend to target a base stock tuned to the current lower demand while acknowledging longer/variable lead time risk from concluded shipments.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime remains variable; average observed concluded lead_time \u22482.36 (evidence: concluded W = {1,3,2,3,2,3,2,1,3,3,3}). Recent demand has dropped: Periods 21\u201326 mean \u2248190.8 (demands {232,238,212,207,154,102}).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19 (Period 28). On-hand=0, in-transit=844. Historical concluded lead times are variable (multiple 1\u20133 period observations). Recent demand has dropped vs earlier spike; last 6 demands (Periods 22\u201327) = {238,212,207,154,102,120} \u2192 mean \u2248188.5. To reflect variable lead time overall use averaged observed lead time (robust to variability). For forecasting demand across review+lead, use a recent-window (N=6) to capture the recent lower regime. Apply same recent window for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These settings steer the OR backend to target a base-stock aligned with current lower demand while acknowledging historical lead-time variability and the large in-transit balance.

Carry-over insight: Recent demand regime has dropped (Periods 22\u201327 mean \u2248188.5); lead-time regime remains variable (observed concluded lead_times mostly 1\u20133, average \u22482).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26): on-hand=0, in-transit=844. Historical concludes show a variable lead-time regime (observed concludes mostly 1\u20133 periods; average \u22482). Recent demand has dropped vs earlier spikes \u2014 periods 22\u201327 demands = {238,212,207,154,102,120,158?} (using latest 6 samples gives a low recent mean). To be robust to observed lead-time variability I let the backend compute L from observed concludes (method: calculate). For demand I use a recent-window forecast to capture the recent lower-demand regime (recent_N, N=6) so mu_hat reflects current demand \xd7 (1+L). For volatility I match the same recent window (recent_N, N=6) to avoid under/over-stocking given variable arrivals and lower recent demand. These choices prioritize reducing excess holding (holding cost=$1) while keeping service against variable lead times.

Carry-over insight: Recent demand regime has dropped: Periods 22\u201327 recent mean \u2248188.5; lead-time regime remains variable with observed concluded lead_times mostly 1\u20133 (avg \u22482).

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:

Lead times remain variable (historical concluded lead_times mostly 1\u20133); average \u22482. To reflect the shorter, stable recent demand window and the variable lead-time regime, set L to be calculated from observed concludes (backend average of observed lead times). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent window to capture the new low-demand regime: use recent_N with N=6 (Periods 26\u201331). This reduces target base-stock to match lower demand while the calculated L captures lead-time variability; recent sigma captures lower volatility, balancing service vs holding cost and guarding against overdue in-transit stock (currently in-transit=844).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/23. On-hand=0, in-transit=844 (pipeline large but arrivals unobserved until next conclude). Historical concludes show variable lead-times (1\u20133 periods); recent demand has dropped to a lower regime (Periods 26\u201332 demands = {102,120,158,140,145,141,135}, mean \u2248134). To reflect variable lead-time use aggregated estimate; to protect against recent lower demand use a recent-window forecast. Chosen: L by calculate to use observed average lead-time from concluded messages; mu_hat and sigma_hat by recent_N (N=7) to target the most recent low-demand regime and reduce excess inventory given holding cost >0.

Carry-over insight: Recent demand regime has dropped (Periods 26\u201332 mean \u2248134); lead-time regime remains variable with observed concluded lead_times mostly 1\u20133 (avg \u22482).

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/30 (Period 34). Recent demand regime has dropped \u2014 recent demands (Periods 26\u201332) average \u2248134 units/week; use a short recent window to forecast. Lead times remain variable in concluded history (observed W mostly 1\u20133, avg \u22482) so infer lead time from observed concludes rather than trusting single promised value. On-hand=0, in-transit=844 \u2014 pipeline is large and likely covers multiple (1+L) periods, so avoid inflating forecast mean from long history. Chosen methods: L by calculation will let backend use observed concluded lead-times average; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N (N=7, covering Periods 26\u201332) to capture the recent low-demand regime and reduced volatility, limiting overstock while maintaining service. This balances profit vs holding cost given high pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Recent demand regime dropped: Periods 26\u201332 mean \u2248134 (evidence: demands 102,120,158,140,145,141,135). Lead-time regime remains variable (concluded lead_times mostly 1\u20133, average \u22482) \u2014 continue treating lead time as variable.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-07 (Period 35). Recent demand regime has been low (Periods 26\u201334 average \u2248134 units/week); lead times remain variable (concluded W mostly 1\u20133, average \u22482). On-hand=0, in-transit=844 (large pipeline relative to recent demand). Choose L='calculate' to let backend use observed conclues to estimate average lead time from history. Use mu_hat recent_N with N=7 to base forecast on the recent low-demand regime (roughly Periods 28\u201334). Use sigma_hat recent_N with N=7 to reflect recent reduced volatility. These settings bias orders toward current low-demand regime while allowing the OR engine's base-stock to account for observed lead-time variability and existing large pipeline, reducing risk of excessive new orders given 844 units already in transit.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-14 (Period 36). Recent demand regime has dropped vs earlier months (recent weekly demands ~106\u219285; carry-over analysis showsPeriods26\u201332 mean\u2248134 and further decline through Period35). Lead times remain variable but average \u22482 based on concluded arrivals; use calculated average lead time to reflect variability. Set mu_hat using a recent window to capture the lower-demand regime. sigma_hat use default to reflect overall historical volatility scaled by (1+L). This balances service (cover short-term demand) while avoiding excess holding given holding cost=$1 and profit=$2.

Carry-over insight: Recent sustained demand drop: periods 26\u201335 show lower mean (~134\u219285 trend); treat current demand regime as lower than earlier history. Lead-time regime remains variable with observed concluded lead_times mostly 1\u20133 (avg \u22482).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/10/21 (Period 37). Recent demand has declined sharply vs earlier history (Periods 27\u201336 demands ~120\u2013158\u219285\u2013147; recent mean ~128). Pipeline is large (in-transit=844) but on-hand=0; shipments historically show variable lead-times (concluded W mostly 1\u20133, average \u22482). To avoid overstock given the large pipeline and lower recent demand, set lead-time to the empirically observed average, and base demand forecast and volatility on the most recent low-demand regime (last 10 periods) so the OR engine caps orders appropriately while maintaining service vs holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Recent demand regime has dropped: Periods 27\u201336 mean \u2248128 (evidence: demands 120,158,140,145,141,135,147,106,85,84); lead-time regime remains variable with observed concluded lead_times mostly 1\u20133 (average \u22482).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/10/28. Recent demand regime has dropped (recent 10-period mean ~125); shipments historically variable (observed concluded lead_times mostly 1\u20133, average ~2) and in-transit=844. To reflect variable actual lead time I select L=calculate (use observed concludes average \u22482). Demand forecast uses a recent-window to capture the lower regime: mu_hat recent_N N=10. Volatility also uses recent_N N=10 to reflect current variance. These settings keep target base-stock aligned to the lower recent demand while the calculated L captures the empirical lead-time variability (mitigating lost/delayed shipment risk given large in-transit).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). Recent demand has fallen sharply (last 5 periods low and volatile) and historical concludes show variable lead-times (1\u20133 periods) with average ~2. Use calculated lead time to let backend average observed concludes. For demand forecast use recent_N (last 5 samples) to capture the new low-demand regime; use same recent_N for sigma to reflect recent volatility. This keeps target inventory small to avoid holding cost while the L=calculate accounts for shipment delays/variability observed in concluded history.

Carry-over insight: Recent sustained demand drop: Periods 34\u201338 mean \u224892.4 (demands 106,85,84,109,78); lead-time regime remains variable (concluded lead_times mostly 1\u20133, average \u22482).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/11 (Period 40). Recent demand regime has dropped materially (recent weeks showing low weekly demand: Periods 33\u201339 demands {147,106,85,84,109,78,61} \u2192 mean \u224897). Shipments historically show variable lead-times (concluded W values mostly 1\u20133; recent average \u22482). To protect against continuing low demand while accounting for variable lead-time, set L using observed concludes (calculate). Forecast demand using a recent-window to capture the new low regime (recent_N, N=7). Volatility also set from the same recent window (recent_N, N=7) so safety stock reflects current low-variance regime. This keeps orders small (matches lower demand) and avoids excess holding given $1 holding cost vs $2 profit.

Carry-over insight: Recent sustained demand drop: Periods 33\u201339 mean \u224897 (demands {147,106,85,84,109,78,61}); lead-time regime remains variable with concluded lead_times mostly 1\u20133 (avg \u22482).

On-hand=0, in-transit=844 (large pipeline). Use calculated lead time to reflect observed variability from concludes.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). Recent demand regime has dropped (recent demands ~61\u2013109, mean ~78 over last 6 periods). Observed lead-times remain variable (mostly 1\u20133, average \u22482). On-hand=0, in-transit=844 \u2014 pipeline is large relative to current low-demand regime, so forecast should use recent low-demand window and a lead-time estimate reflecting observed variability. Choices: L=calculate to let backend use observed concludes (captures variable 1\u20133 LT); mu_hat=recent_N with N=6 to base (1+L)-period demand on the last 6 low-demand observations; sigma_hat=recent_N with N=6 to reflect recent low volatility. This reduces ordering relative to long-run history while letting the OR engine account for lead-time and service-level tradeoff.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/02 (Period 43). Recent demand regime has dropped substantially (recent weekly demands ~70\u2013150), while observed concluded lead-times remain variable around 2 periods. On-hand=0, in-transit=844 (large pipeline). I set L using historical observed lead-times (let system average) to capture variability. For demand I use a recent-window forecast to reflect the sustained lower-demand regime (use last 7 samples to capture the downshift while smoothing week-to-week noise). Volatility likewise from the same recent window. This keeps base-stock aligned to current low demand and avoids excess replenishment given the large in-transit position.

Carry-over insight: Recent sustained demand drop: recent periods show low weekly demand (~70\u2013150); lead-time regime remains variable with concluded lead-times mostly 1\u20133 (avg \u22482).

LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). On-hand=0, in-transit=844 (large pipeline). Historical concluded lead-times vary (mostly 1\u20133); use averaged observed lead time. Demand has been in a sustained low regime recently (periods 33\u201343); use recent-window forecast and volatility to reflect current lower demand. Using recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat keeps forecasts responsive while L='calculate' averages observed lead times to capture variability. This balances service-level (by acknowledging variable lead time) against holding cost (by using recent lower demand estimates despite large in-transit stock).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16 (Period 45). On-hand=0, in-transit=844. Recent history shows a sustained low-demand regime over the last ~10 weeks (Periods 35\u201344 demands: 85,84,109,78,61,69,67,109,61,55 -> mean \u224877). Lead times remain variable but average \u22482 periods based on concluded arrivals. To avoid overstock given high pipeline and low recent demand, set lead time to explicit 2.0 (captures observed average). Forecast (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) will use a recent window (N=10) to reflect the current low-demand regime and suppress influence from earlier high-demand periods. This keeps base-stock conservative so the OR engine reduces new orders while accounting for current pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Recent sustained low-demand regime persists: Periods 35\u201344 mean \u224877 (demands: 85,84,109,78,61,69,67,109,61,55); lead-time regime remains variable with observed concluded lead_times averaging \u22482.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/23 (Period 46). On-hand=0, in-transit=844. Historical concluded lead_times are variable (mostly 1\u20133); use calculated average lead time to reflect variability. Recent demand has been in a sustained low regime (roughly periods 36\u201345 averaging ~ seventy-some units). Use a recent-window demand forecast to capture the lower recent mean and match variance to recent observations.

Carry-over insight: New sustained low-demand regime (Periods 36\u201345 mean \u224877); lead-time regime remains variable with observed concluded lead_times mostly 1\u20133 (avg \u22482).

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). Recent data show a sustained low-demand regime (Periods 36\u201345 mean \u224877) and concluded shipments show variable lead-times (observed W mostly 1\u20133, average \u22482). To respect observed variability but let backend use historical concludes, set L to 'calculate' (uses observed average lead-time). Demand forecast uses a recent-window to capture the low-demand regime: use recent_N with N=10 (roughly Periods 37\u201346) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so (1+L)-scaled mean and volatility reflect the reduced demand and recent variance. This keeps orders modest to avoid high holding costs while acknowledging lead-time variability so pipeline coverage is appropriate.

Carry-over insight: Recent sustained low-demand regime persists: Periods 36\u201345 mean \u224877 (evidence: demands 85,84,109,78,61,69,67,109,61,55); lead-time regime remains variable with concluded lead_times mostly 1\u20133 (avg \u22482).
