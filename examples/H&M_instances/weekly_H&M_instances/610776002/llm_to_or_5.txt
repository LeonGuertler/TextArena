Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. SKU 610776002 (women's T-shirt). Historical demands: [148,175,160,233,308] (mean ~205.2). On-hand 0, in-transit 0, no concluded arrivals to suggest lead-time deviation or lost shipments. Promised lead time = 4; no evidence to override. Use default lead time so backend applies promised L=4. Use default demand estimates (all-sample mean/SD scaled by (1+L)) to give a stable forecast given limited history and no recent changepoint. This balances service level (using full-sample mean) against holding cost conservatively while avoiding assumptions about missing shipments.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/2/18 (Period 2). On-hand=0, in-transit=314. Period 1 conclude shows ordered=314 arrived=0 (ordered in Period 1) \u2014 signals a delayed or potentially lost shipment but only one conclude exists so actual lead time cannot be reliably estimated. Historical demand samples mean = 204.8 (n=5), (1+promised L)=5 \u2192 aggregate demand over review+lead \u22481024. I keep L at the promised/default because we lack multiple concluded lead-time observations to infer a different lead-time regime. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (all-sample estimates scaled by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L)) so the OR engine sees the full-demand prior; this balances service level vs holding cost given modest profit/holding ratio (q\u22480.667).

Carry-over insight: Period1 ordered=314 arrived=0 (ordered on Period1) \u2014 possible delayed or lost shipment; monitor subsequent conclude messages to confirm extended lead time or loss.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). Recent realized demands = [148,175,160,233,308], mean=204.8. On-hand=0, in-transit=635 (matches orders 314+321). Promised lead time=4 and no concluded arrivals yet for orders placed in Periods 1\u20132, so actual lead time cannot be inferred from conclude messages. To avoid over-reacting to missing conclude messages (could be normal given promised L=4 or lost shipments), use default lead time and default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR backend applies its standard base-stock calculation while preserving service-level via the backend cap.

Carry-over insight: Possible delayed or lost shipments: orders from Period1 (314) and Period2 (321) have not concluded; in-transit total=635. Monitor future conclude messages to confirm extended lead time or loss.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-03-04. Historical demand samples: [148,175,160,233,308] (mean=204.8, std\u224866.27). All three recent orders (Periods 1-3) have not concluded (arrived=0) and in-transit=980 \u2014 signals extended lead time or lost shipments. To be conservative against stockouts given high recent demand (period demands 266,316,306) and missing confirms, I set lead time explicit longer than promised to force larger pipeline coverage. Choices: L explicit=8 to cover extended/unknown delays; mu_hat default to use (1+L)*mean across all samples (captures baseline demand scaled by longer review+lead window); sigma_hat default to inflate volatility by sqrt(1+L). This increases base_stock and cap to prioritize service level while acknowledging holding cost tradeoff (profit=2 vs holding=1).

Carry-over insight: Delayed/lost shipments: orders from Period1 (314), Period2 (321), Period3 (345) have not concluded by Period4; treat as extended lead-time regime until concludes appear.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). All four recent orders (Periods 1-4 totaling 1335) remain in-transit with no concludes \u2192 strong evidence of an extended lead-time / disrupted shipments regime. I set L explicitly longer than the promised 4 to force the OR engine to plan for additional pipeline delay and avoid stockouts. Demand history mean ~204.8, stdev ~68.2; use default mu/sigma calculations (they scale with chosen L) so the backend applies the standard base-stock math while accounting for the extended lead time.

Carry-over insight: Extended lead-time regime: Orders from Periods 1\u20134 (314,321,345,355) all un-concluded by Period 4; treat shipments as delayed/lost until concludes appear.

Daily Reward (R_t): $442.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/18 (Period 6). Recent concludes show Period1 order (314) arrived with observed lead_time=4; other recent orders remain in-transit. Historical demand samples = [148,175,160,233,308], mean=204.8. Given one confirmed lead-time observation equal to promised lead time and no consistent evidence of a different regime yet, use default lead time and default demand statistics to let the OR backend compute base-stock while keeping policy responsive to observed in-transit stock (on-hand=62, in-transit=1376). Defaults balance service level against holding cost without overreacting to currently unresolved shipments.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead_time=4 for the Period1 order (arrived in Period5); treat other outstanding orders as delayed until they conclude, but do not yet change lead-time regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $427.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). Recent concluded history shows orders placed in Periods 1\u20132 arrived with lead_time=4; several later orders remain in-transit. On-hand=113, in-transit=1055 so pipeline is large relative to demand. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses observed lead-times (confirmed 4). Demand has shifted up vs older seed samples (recent demands: 316,306,283,252,270); to capture the recent higher mean and reduce sensitivity to older low samples I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat (uses last 5 demands, (1+L) multiplier applied by backend). This balances service level (avoid stockouts while many in-transit) against holding cost by basing forecasts on the recent regime and letting the OR cap limit aggressive orders if pipeline already large.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead_time=4 for orders placed on Periods 1 and 2 (arrived in Periods 5 and 6 respectively); treat lead-time regime as 4 unless future concludes show change.

Daily Reward (R_t): $634.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). Recent concludes show multiple orders (Periods 1\u20133) arriving with actual lead_time=4, so current lead-time regime is confirmed at 4. Recent demand has shifted up vs the older small-sample historical baseline \u2014 last 5 observed demands (Periods 3\u20137): [306,283,252,270,364], mean=295, indicating a higher demand regime. On-hand=94 and in-transit=995 (large pipeline) \u2014 do not chase extra safety from in-transit since many concludes now match promised L=4. Choices: set L to default (use promised lead time = 4) because concludes confirm promised lead time; set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the elevated recent mean across the review+lead period; keep sigma_hat default so backend uses full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances service (higher forecast to meet recent demand) while relying on pipeline inventory and avoiding overstating volatility given limited data on changed variance.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained actual lead_time=4 (evidence: Period1 arrived in Period5, Period2 in Period6, Period3 in Period7); Recent demand regime shift upward (evidence: mean of last 5 demands Periods3\u20137 = 295 units vs earlier smaller-sample baseline).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08): recent concludes confirm an actual lead time of 4 periods (Periods1->5,2->6,3->7,4->8). Recent demand has stepped up: last 5 realized demands (Periods4\u20138 = 283,252,270,364,372) average \u2248 308 units/period, higher than earlier baseline. On-hand (77) + in-transit (1046) = 1,123 units \u2014 enough to cover ~3.6\u20134.0 periods at recent demand; with L\u22484 we must cover (1+L)=5 periods of demand in pipeline. To reflect the sustained lead-time regime and the upward demand shift I set L by calculation from observed lead times and use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine forecasts across the review+lead horizon using the most recent regime statistics. This balances service (capture higher demand) against holding cost using up-to-date mean and volatility.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/15 (Period 10). On-hand=161, in-transit=1091. Concluded history confirms consistent actual lead_time=4 (arrivals for orders placed in Periods1\u20135 all showed W=4). Demand has shifted upward recently: last 5 observed demands (Periods5\u20139 = 252,270,364,372,271) have mean \u2248305.8, noticeably above earlier baseline. To protect service with L+1 review coverage and higher recent demand, set lead time to promised/default (4) and use recent_N for demand estimates (capture recent upward regime). Use recent_N for sigma to capture recent volatility. These choices supply the OR backend with an (1+L)-scaled mean and std focused on the latest regime, increasing base stock to avoid stockouts while letting the capped order cap restrain excess inventory given large pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained actual lead_time=4 (evidence: arrivals for orders placed in Periods1\u20135 each had lead_time=4); Recent demand regime elevated: mean of last 5 demands (Periods5\u20139)=305.8, retain monitoring.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019/4/22): recent concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead_time=4 (orders from Periods1\u20135 arrived after 4 periods). Recent demand has shifted up: last 5 demands (Periods6\u201310) = [270,364,372,271,310], mean=317.4. On-hand=0, in-transit=1424 (covers multiple upcoming periods). Set L by calculating observed lead times to lock in confirmed lead-time=4. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the elevated demand regime over the last 5 periods and align the review+lead forecast with current demand. Use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices help the OR backend raise the base stock to meet higher short-term demand while using recent volatility to size safety stock; using observed lead-time prevents underordering given past delays.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained actual lead_time=4 (evidence: arrivals for orders placed in Periods1\u20135 each had lead_time=4); Recent demand regime elevated: mean of last 5 demands (Periods6\u201310)=317.4; retain monitoring.

LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019/4/29). On-hand=0, in-transit=1350. Recent conclude history consistently shows actual lead_time=4 (multiple orders with lead_time=4), and recent demand has shifted higher (large demands in Periods7\u201311). To match observed lead-time regime and elevated recent demand, set lead time by calculation from observed concludes and use recent_N=5 for demand mean and volatility to capture the current high-demand regime and its variability. This increases target base-stock to protect service level while accounting for higher short-term variance.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). Historical conclude messages confirm a sustained actual lead_time=4 (multiple arrivals with lead_time=4). Recent demand has shifted materially higher (large demands in Periods 8\u201312). On-hand=0, in-transit=1506 covers pipeline but elevated demand and volatility justify using recent-sample estimates. Choose L=default to use promised lead time (matches confirmed actual=4). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the elevated recent demand regime (last 5 observed demands) so the OR backend increases base-stock and accounts for higher variability.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained lead_time=4 (evidence: multiple concluded orders with lead_time=4, Periods5\u201312). Recent demand regime elevated: mean demand over Periods8\u201312 = 388.2 units (evidence: demands 372,271,310,564,424); retain monitoring.

Using recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat biases the OR engine toward higher re-order targets to avoid stockouts given large pipeline and confirmed L=4, while keeping L as default avoids over-adjusting lead-time assumptions.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/20 (Period 15). Historical concludes show a sustained actual lead_time=4 (multiple concluded orders with lead_time=4 across Periods5\u201314). Recent demand has shifted upward (last 5 demands Periods10\u201314 = [310,564,424,304,431], mean ~406.6), so forecast should use recent demand to capture the new regime. Set L to default (promised=4) consistent with observed actual lead time and OR expectations. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to make the (1+L)-period demand forecast responsive to the elevated recent demand and its volatility, improving service while controlling holding cost given known lead time and large in-transit position (1561 units).

Carry-over insight: Sustained actual lead_time=4 confirmed by multiple concluded orders (evidence: arrivals for orders placed in Periods1\u20139 all with lead_time=4); Recent demand regime elevated: mean of last 5 demands (Periods10\u201314)=~406.6; retain monitoring.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/27 (Period16). On-hand=0, in-transit=1925. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead_time=4 (multiple orders concluded with W=4); treat lead time as the promised 4 for the OR engine. Demand has shifted higher recently: last 5 observed demands (Periods11\u201315) = [564,424,304,431,442], mean=433. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the elevated demand regime so base-stock reacts to current demand while respecting the OR engine's lead-time assumption. The large in-transit (1925) provides significant pipeline cover (~4+ period demand) but on-hand=0 so orders should target the elevated short-term demand to avoid stockouts. Using recent_N for both demand parameters balances service (profit per unit = $2) against holding cost ($1) by aligning mu_hat to current realized demand and estimating volatility from the same window.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained actual lead_time=4 (evidence: many concluded orders with lead_time=4 across Periods5\u201315); Recent demand regime elevated: mean demand of last 5 periods (Periods11\u201315)=433 (564,424,304,431,442).

Recent demand has shifted up: mean of last 5 observed demands (Periods12\u201316 = 424,304,431,442,435) = 407.2 units. Given confirmed L=4 and elevated recent demand, I use L=default (promised=4) and set demand estimates using the most recent regime (recent_N N=5) so the OR backend's base-stock and cap reflect current higher demand while accounting for 4-period pipeline and variability. This balances service level (to avoid stockouts given large pipeline lead time) against holding cost.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019/6/10). On-hand=33, in-transit=1419. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead_time=4 (multiple orders concluded with W=4); therefore keep L at promised (4). Recent demand has shifted up sharply (large demands in Periods13\u201317), so set demand forecast using recent_N (last 5 periods) to capture the elevated regime. Use recent_N for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These choices ensure the OR backend raises base-stock to meet higher near-term demand while keeping volatility estimates current to balance service level vs holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained actual lead_time=4 (evidence: many concluded orders with lead_time=4 through Period17). Recent demand regime further elevated: mean demand over last 5 periods (Periods13\u201317 = 304,431,442,435,640) \u2248 450.4; monitor for persistence.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-17 (Period 19). Historical concludes confirm sustained actual lead_time=4 (multiple concluded orders with W=4). Recent demand has shifted up sharply: last 5 realized demands (Periods14\u201318) = [431,442,435,640,419], mean\u2248473.4 and elevated variability. On-hand=0, in-transit=1826 (large pipeline). I keep L as default (promised lead time=4) because concluded history supports L=4 and backend expects promised lead time. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture the new higher-demand regime and elevated volatility; this biases base-stock and caps upward to protect service level during the sustained higher-demand period while the large in-transit pipeline limits immediate over-ordering.

Carry-over insight: sustained actual lead_time=4 (evidence: many concluded orders with lead_time=4 through Period18); recent demand regime elevated \u2014 last 5 demands (Periods14\u201318) mean\u2248473.4, higher variance observed.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24 (Period 20). History shows many concluded orders with consistent actual lead_time=4; in-transit is large (1879) and on-hand=136. Recent demand regime is elevated\u2014last 5 demands (Periods15\u201319)=442,435,640,419,439 (mean\u2248475) and higher variance. I set L to default (promised lead time=4) because concluded evidence supports actual L=4. For demand forecast and volatility I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the elevated recent regime so the OR backend sizes base_stock to cover (1+L) periods using the most recent demand behavior while keeping holding costs in check.

Carry-over insight: Sustained actual lead_time=4 confirmed by multiple concluded orders through Period19; recent demand regime elevated: mean demand over Periods15\u201319 \u2248475 with higher variance.

To match observed lead time and recent higher demand, keep L at promised (use default=4), and base demand forecast on the most recent regime: use recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the last 5 demands. This increases target base-stock to improve service while sigma_hat recent_N captures elevated variability.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-08 (Period 22). Recent history shows consistent concluded arrivals with actual lead_time=4 (multiple confirms through Period21). Demand has been elevated vs initial samples; on-hand=205 plus in-transit=1915 provides substantial coverage. I therefore accept the promised/observed lead time and use default demand estimators so the OR backend applies the (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std formulas. This balances keeping service with higher recent demand while avoiding manual overrides given strong lead-time evidence and large pipeline.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019-07-15): on-hand=616, in-transit=1266. Historical concludes show consistent arrivals with lead_time=4 (multiple orders concluded with W=4 across Periods5\u201322) \u2014 actual lead time regime is sustained at 4. Recent demand has increased vs early baseline; last 5 concluded demands (Periods18\u201322) = [419,439,301,232,238], mean \u2248 325.8 and higher variance. Choose L by calculating observed lead times to reflect confirmed regime. For demand across review+lead (1+L) use recent_N with N=5 to capture the elevated recent regime and avoid dilution from older low-demand samples. For sigma use recent_N N=5 to reflect current volatility. These settings bias the base-stock toward meeting the higher recent demand while the recent-N volatility tightens safety stock to recent variance; using observed lead-time prevents under-ordering given earlier delayed/lost concerns.

Carry-over insight: Sustained actual lead_time=4 confirmed by concluded orders through Period22; recent demand regime elevated \u2014 mean of last 5 demands (Periods18\u201322) \u2248 325.8, higher variance.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22). Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead_time=4 (multiple concluded orders with lead_time=4 through Period 23). On-hand=1032, in-transit=638 \u2014 healthy coverage but recent demand has shifted vs early history. I set L to promised (default=4) because concludes confirm stable 4-period lead time. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the latest demand regime (last 5 demands: Periods19\u201323 = 439,301,232,238,212) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7recent mean and volatility, keeping service while avoiding excess holding cost.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Recent demand has moderated versus earlier spikes: last 5 demands (Periods20\u201324)=301,232,238,212,207 \u2192 mean\u2248238. Use promised/default lead time (4) consistent with observed concludes. Set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to reflect the most recent regime (avoids over-ordering from earlier spikes).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-1001.00

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). Observed on-hand=1309, in-transit=0 and a sustained actual lead_time=4 regime (confirmed repeatedly by conclude messages). Recent demand has shown volatility; the most recent 5-period mean demand (Periods21\u201325 = 232,238,212,207,154) is ~208.6 which is lower than some earlier elevated regimes, so I use a short recent window to capture current demand. Because promised lead time=4 has been consistently validated, I keep L as default (promised). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the most recent 5 demands\u2014this keeps order targets aligned with the latest observed demand while avoiding overreacting to older spikes. With high on-hand and zero in-transit, this approach prevents excessive ordering (reducing holding cost) while preserving service given the confirmed 4-period lead time.

On-hand=1207, in-transit=0, demand history shows elevated and variable demand recently but no new regime change since last conclusions. With ample on-hand and a confirmed LT=4, use the promised/default lead-time and default demand estimates so the OR backend applies its standard (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility across all samples.

Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead_time=4 (many orders concluded with W=4); demand has recently been elevated and volatile. I will keep L at the promised/confirmed regime and use recent data to capture the elevated demand: set L default (promised=4), mu_hat from recent_N (N=5) to target current higher mean demand over the last 5 periods, and sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to capture recent higher variance. This balances service (higher forecast for elevated demand) against holding cost given already large on-hand and pipeline.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). Historical concludes confirm sustained actual lead_time=4. Current inventory: on-hand=789, in-transit=456 (healthy pipeline). Recent demand has fallen versus earlier elevated regime: last 5 concluded demands (Periods25\u201329) = [154,102,120,158,140], mean=134.8. To avoid overstock while respecting proven L=4, use promised/default lead time and set demand estimates from the most recent 5 observations (capture the recent downshift); use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat.

Carry-over insight: Sustained actual lead_time=4 confirmed by concluded orders through Period29; NEW: recent demand regime has shifted down \u2014 mean of last 5 demands (Periods25\u201329)=134.8 (values 154,102,120,158,140).

Date 2019-09-09 (Period 31). On-hand=644, in-transit=456. Historical concludes confirm sustained actual lead_time=4; promised lead time=4\u2014no evidence to change L. Recent demand regime has shifted down (Period30 insight: last 5 demands, Periods25\u201329 = [154,102,120,158,140], mean=134.8). To capture the new lower demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (focus model on most recent 5 observations). Using default L keeps promised lead time (4) so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7recent mean and volatility over the recent regime, balancing service level and holding cost given high on-hand inventory.

Carry-over insight: Recent demand regime shifted down: mean of last 5 demands (Periods25\u201329 = 154,102,120,158,140) = 134.8; treat as new baseline until reversed.

LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30). On-hand=677, in-transit=0. Historical concludes strongly confirm sustained actual lead_time=4 (many arrivals with W=4). Recent demand has shifted down: last 5 demands (Periods29\u201333 = 140,145,141,135,147) mean \u2248141.6, lower variance than earlier elevated regime. I set L to default (promised lead time=4) because concluded history supports it. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new lower-demand regime (review+lead period scaled by 1+L will be computed by backend). This balances service (covering L+1 periods of demand) while avoiding excess holding given current high on-hand inventory.

Carry-over insight: Recent demand regime shifted down: mean of last 5 demands (Periods29\u201333 = 140,145,141,135,147) = 141.6; treat as current baseline until reversed.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-07 (Period 35). Context: confirmed sustained actual lead_time=4 historically; recent demand regime has shifted down. Current inventory: on-hand=571, in-transit=36 (pipeline=607). For L=4 the review+lead horizon is 5 periods; recent 5-period mean demand \u2248134.8 \u2192 5-period demand \u2248674, so pipeline is slightly short. Choose L=default to keep promised lead time (matches observed sustained L=4). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to anchor forecast to the new lower-demand regime. Use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture current lower variance. These choices steer the OR engine to a lower base stock consistent with the downshift while acknowledging the small shortfall in pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Recent demand regime shifted down: mean of last 5 demands (Periods30\u201334 = 145,141,135,147,106) = 134.8; sustained actual lead_time=4 confirmed through Period 34.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-14 (Period 36). History shows sustained actual lead_time=4 (many concluded orders with W=4). Recent demand has shifted down: last 5 demands (Periods31\u201335) = [141,135,147,106,85], mean=122.8. Current stock: on-hand=486, in-transit=120 \u2192 pipeline_inventory=606. With L=4 we must cover (1+L)=5 periods; 5\xd7recent mean\u2248614 so current pipeline is slightly below the 5-period demand (small shortfall). I therefore set L to the promised/default (consistent with observed sustained lead_time=4) and use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new low-demand regime and reduced volatility; this keeps orders conservative vs. older higher-demand data while the lower regime persists.

Carry-over insight: Sustained actual lead_time=4 confirmed through Period35 (multiple concluded orders with lead_time=4); Recent demand regime shifted down \u2014 mean of last 5 demands (Periods31\u201335) = 122.8 (141,135,147,106,85).

Recent demand regime has shifted down: mean of last 5 demands (Periods31\u201335) = 122.8; inventory on-hand=402, in-transit=154. Given confirmed LT=4, use promised/default L to keep OR engine aligned with reality. For demand forecast use recent_N (N=5) to capture the new lower-demand regime; likewise use recent_N (N=5) for sigma to reflect reduced volatility in the recent window. This keeps base-stock targeted to the current low-demand regime while honoring observed lead-time behavior and avoiding overstocks given holding cost >0.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/10/28 (Period 38). Historical concludes show a sustained actual lead_time=4; recent demand has declined sharply. Current inventory: on-hand=293, in-transit=183 (total pipeline=476). Recent 5-period demand (Periods33\u201337 = 147,106,85,84,109) mean = 106.2, showing a new lower-demand regime; pipeline (476) is slightly below (1+L)*recent_mean => 5*106.2=531. I therefore keep L at the promised/default (supported by many concluded lead_time=4 observations) and set demand estimates using the most recent 5-sample regime to capture the downshift; use recent_N for sigma_hat as well to reflect lower recent volatility. This balances service level (using recent demand to avoid overstock) against holding cost given current high on-hand.

Carry-over insight: New recent demand downshift: mean of last 5 demands (Periods33\u201337 = 147,106,85,84,109) = 106.2; treat as current baseline until reversed.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=251, in-transit=227. Historical concludes confirm sustained actual lead_time=4; recent demand has shifted down in the last several periods. I set L to default (promised lead time=4). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture the new low-demand regime (most recent five demands show a clear downshift), so the OR engine will size base stock to current lower demand while reflecting recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: NEW: Recent demand regime downshift confirmed \u2014 mean demand over last 5 periods (Periods 34\u201338 = 106,85,84,109,78) = 92.4; treat as current baseline until reversed.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019/11/11). History shows sustained actual lead_time=4 (many concluded orders with lead_time=4). Current inventory: on-hand=274, in-transit=143 (no overdue un-concluded shipments). Recent demand has shifted down markedly over the last 5 periods (Periods35\u201339). To match the observed short-run regime and keep inventory lean vs. holding cost, set L to promised (4), forecast demand using the most recent 5-period mean for the review+lead horizon, and estimate demand volatility from the same 5-period window.

Carry-over insight: NEW: Recent demand regime downshift \u2014 mean demand over Periods35\u201339 = 83.4 (period demands: 85,84,109,78,61); treat as current baseline until reversed.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/25 (Period 42). On-hand=201, in-transit=151 (total pipeline=352). Historical concludes strongly confirm sustained actual lead_time=4 (many concluded orders with lead_time=4 through Period 41). Recent demand has shifted down sharply; last 5 demands (Periods 37\u201341 = 109,78,61,69,67) average \u224876.8, so I use a recent-N demand estimate to capture the new low baseline. Keeping L as default (promised=4) matches observed regime and the OR engine's assumptions. mu_hat: use recent_N N=5 to scale (1+L)\xd7recent mean so ordering targets the new lower demand level and avoids excess holding cost. sigma_hat: use recent_N N=5 to reflect reduced recent variability. This combination preserves service given confirmed lead time while reducing inventory risk under the new low-demand regime.

Reconcile: pipeline (in-transit=122) + on-hand=294 covers several periods at the new lower demand level; no evidence of lost shipments and lead time remains 4.

Current on-hand=73 + in-transit=259 => pipeline=332, which is slightly below (1+L)\xd7recent mean (5\xd772.2=361). To reflect the confirmed L=4 regime and the new low-demand baseline I use a recent-N forecast (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets the current low-demand regime and avoids excess holding while acknowledging pipeline shortfall. Using recent data also responds to the many past delayed shipments (now resolved) by relying on observed lead_time rather than assuming losses.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/23 (Period 46). On-hand=63, in-transit=255. Historical concludes repeatedly confirm actual lead_time=4 so use promised lead time (default). Recent demand has dropped\u2014last 5 demands (Periods41\u201345) mean \u224871.2 \u2014 so forecast and volatility should follow the recent regime to avoid excess holding cost. Therefore set L=default, mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture the current low-demand regime and reduced variability; this keeps orders aligned with observed short-run demand while respecting the confirmed lead-time.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). Historical concludes confirm sustained actual lead_time=4. Recent demand has shifted down: last 5 demands (Periods42-46) = [109,61,55,64,92], mean\u224876.2. On-hand(22)+in-transit(263)=285 units \u2014 short of (1+L)*recent_mean \u2248 5*76.2=381, so we should target the lower recent demand regime while replenishing to cover the 5-period review+lead horizon. Set L to promised (default=4) since concludes consistently show LT=4; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture the new low-demand regime and reduced volatility.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained actual lead_time=4 (evidence: many concluded orders with lead_time=4 through Period46); NEW: recent demand regime downshift \u2014 mean of last 5 demands (Periods42\u201346 = 109,61,55,64,92) \u2248 76.2; treat as current baseline until reversed.
