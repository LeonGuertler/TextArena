Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11; no special calendar events affecting basic womens T-shirt. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so no arrivals expected this period. No evidence of changed lead time or demand regime in historical concludes; use promised lead time and full-sample demand stats. Set L=default (promised 0) so mu_hat and sigma_hat use all samples: mean demand=204.8, std=59.28. This gives mu_hat=(1+L)*mean=204.8 to target service while sigma_hat=std=59.28 to reflect observed variability and balance profit vs. holding cost.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period date 2019/2/18. Period1 conclude shows an order placed=234 arrived=234 (lead_time=0) and demand=266, confirming same-period lead time and recent high demand. I use promised lead time (default L=0). Update demand estimates using all available samples including Period1 demand (samples: 148,175,160,233,308,266) \u2192 mean=215.0, std\u224858.74. With L=0 use default mu_hat=(1+L)*mean=215.0 and sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std\u224858.74. These parameters reflect confirmed 0 lead time and higher recent demand to raise the base-stock while keeping volatility for safety.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed lead_time=0 (Period1 conclude: ordered=234 arrived=234, lead_time was 0); Updated demand mean=215.0 based on samples [148,175,160,233,308,266].

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/2/25. Two concluded periods (Periods 1\u20132) show orders placed arrived same period \u2192 confirmed lead_time=0. On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments. Historical demands now: [148,175,160,233,308,266,316], mean\u2248229.43, std\u224864.84. Use calculated L (average observed lead times=0) to match confirmed fast fulfillment; use default demand scaling (1+L)*mean to let OR compute base-stock from full-sample mean; use default sigma to reflect observed volatility. This balances service (higher mean ensures availability) vs holding cost (L=0 keeps review period short).

Daily Reward (R_t): $520.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Observed lead times from concluded periods 1\u20133 are all 0, and recent sales increased the demand sample set to [148,175,160,233,308,266] (mean=215). On-hand and in-transit are 0, so we must order to cover expected demand this period. I set L to the average observed lead time (0) to match confirmed same-period arrivals. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes base-stock from full-sample mean (1+L)*mean = 215 and full-sample volatility (sqrt(1+L)*std \u2248 64.34). These settings align the backend's base-stock with the updated observed demand while avoiding ad-hoc inflation of safety stock given consistent zero lead time and no evidence of lost shipments.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent concluded history shows all orders arriving same period (lead_time=0 confirmed). Demand samples now: [148,175,160,233,308,266] \u2192 mean=215, std\u224856. With on-hand=0 and in-transit=0, use promised lead time (default L=0). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat to 'default' so OR backend uses (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std (i.e., mu_hat=215, sigma_hat\u224856). This keeps the base-stock tied to observed demand without overreacting to short-term noise and balances service level vs holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

Daily Reward (R_t): $483.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. On-hand=21, in-transit=0. Recent demand has risen vs earlier history (last 5 demands: 266,316,306,283,252 \u2192 mean=284.6), so I bias forecast to recent regime. No concluded late arrivals; promised lead time (0) has been consistently observed. Set L="default" (0). Set mu_hat using recent_N on last 5 samples to capture the higher recent mean: mu_hat=(1+L)*mean_recent=284.6. Set sigma_hat using recent_N (last 5) sample std \u224826.73 to reflect realized volatility. These parameters raise the base-stock to meet elevated demand while keeping holding risk modest given high sell-through.

Carry-over insight: Recent demand regime increased: last 5-period mean=284.6 (periods 1-5 recent demands: 266,316,306,283,252) \u2014 adopt recent_N=5 for demand forecasting until reversed.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Observed concluded lead times = 0 for all past orders; recent demand regime persists (carry-over insight): use recent_N=5 demand estimate (periods 1-5 mean=284.6). On-hand=27, in-transit=0; with L=0 we forecast (1+L)*mean = 284.6 demand over the review+lead period and set sigma from the same 5-sample window (std\u224826.72). These parameters prioritize service (profit>holding cost) while avoiding excessive holding given limited current on-hand and zero pipeline.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-04-01. History shows consistent same-day arrivals (lead_time=0 in concluded periods). Recent demand regime adopted in Period 6: use the 5-period recent mean (284.6) for forecasting. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish to cover expected (1+L) demand. Set L to promised/default (0) since concluded messages confirm 0 lead time. Use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the higher recent demand regime. Use recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility (std of [266,316,306,283,252] = 23.89). These parameters aim to raise base-stock to meet higher demand while keeping holding cost considered (profit=2, holding=1 implies moderate service level).

Carry-over insight: Recent demand regime increase: use recent_N=5 forecast (5-period mean=284.6 from [266,316,306,283,252]); confirmed lead_time=0 from concluded periods.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/8 (Period 9). All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 repeatedly; recent demand regime remains elevated (last 5 demands = [266,316,306,283,252], mean=284.6). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish to cover current-period demand. Choose L by averaging observed lead times (all 0). Use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained higher-demand regime; mu_hat=(1+L)*mean_last5=284.6. sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std_last5 \u224826.72, reflecting recent volatility. These parameters raise the base stock to meet higher demand while avoiding excess holding given holding cost=$1 vs profit=$2 (service-target q=0.667 implicit in OR engine).

Carry-over insight: Recent demand regime increased: use recent_N=5 forecast (last5 mean=284.6 from [266,316,306,283,252]); confirmed lead_time=0 from concluded periods.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15. On-hand=62, in-transit=0. Concluded history consistently shows arrivals with lead_time=0; keep L=0 (promised). Recent demand regime persists (carry-over): use recent_N=5 for demand forecasting (last5 demands [266,316,306,283,252], mean=284.6) so mu_hat=(1+L)*mean=284.6. Volatility estimated from same 5-sample regime: sample std \u224826.72, sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std \u224826.72. These parameters maintain service for the elevated recent demand while limiting excess holding given holding cost=$1 and profit=$2 (q=0.666...), aligning base-stock toward higher service but controlled cap.

Carry-over insight: Recent demand regime increased: use recent_N=5 forecast (last5 mean=284.6 from [266,316,306,283,252]); confirmed lead_time=0 from concluded periods.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Lead time confirmed 0 in concluded history; stay with promised lead time. Recent demand regime persists so use most recent 5 weeks for forecast (periods 6-10 demands: 270,364,372,271,310 -> mean=317.4, std(sample)=49.01). Using L=0 keeps (1+L) factor =1; recent_N forecast raises base_stock to meet higher observed demand while sigma captures increased volatility for service-level sizing.

Daily Reward (R_t): $678.00

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent concluded history shows lead_time=0 consistently (Period1-11 conclude). Demand has shifted up recently: last 5 demands (Periods 7-11) = [364,372,271,310,564], 5-period mean=376.2 and std\u2248100.88. I use L=default (promised 0). For mu_hat I use recent_N=5 to capture the new higher-demand regime (mu_hat = (1+L)*mean = 376.2). For sigma_hat I use recent_N=5 to reflect higher observed volatility (sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std = 100.88). These parameters raise the base-stock to improve service during the higher-demand regime while sigma captures uncertainty to avoid excessive overstock.

Carry-over insight: Recent demand regime increased: last5 mean=376.2 (Periods 7-11 demands [364,372,271,310,564]); confirmed lead_time=0 from concluded periods.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06. History shows consistent concluded arrivals with lead_time=0. Recent demand has stepped up; last 5 demands (Periods 8-12 = [372,271,310,564,424]) average 388.2, higher than earlier regimes. On-hand=1, in-transit=0 so we need same-period coverage (L=0). I set L via calculate (observed lead times average=0). Forecast (mu_hat) uses recent_N=5 to capture the new higher regime: mu_hat=(1+L)*mean(last5)=388.2. Volatility (sigma_hat) uses recent_N=5; sample std of last5 \u2248102.27, scaled by sqrt(1+L)=1 => 102.27. These parameters push the OR backend to hold more stock to avoid stockouts under the elevated demand regime while accounting for holding cost via the backend's service-level cap.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed lead_time=0 from concluded periods; recent demand regime increased \u2014 last5 (Periods 8-12) mean=388.2, std\u2248102.27.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent concluded periods consistently show lead_time=0. Demand has moved to a higher regime; using the most recent 5 observations (Periods 9-13 demands = [271,310,564,424,304], mean=373.8, std\u2248120.62) captures current level and variability. Set L=default to reflect confirmed 0 lead time; use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to bias the base-stock toward current elevated demand while keeping volatility high so OR backend raises safety stock accordingly.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
History shows consistent concluded lead_time=0. Demand has shifted up recently; last 5 concluded demands (Periods 10-14 = 310,564,424,304,431) have mean 406.6 and elevated volatility. Use L=default (promised=0). Use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the new higher-demand regime: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_last5 = 406.6. Use recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility: sample std \u2248106.68 => sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std = 106.68. These parameters raise the base-stock to meet higher near-term demand while the sigma increases safety stock to protect service level without excessive holding given holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Recent demand regime increased: last5 (Periods 10-14) mean=406.6, std\u2248106.68 (evidence: demands 310,564,424,304,431). Confirmed lead_time=0 from concluded periods.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent concluded history (Periods 11-15) shows lead_time consistently 0 and a clear demand uptick. On-hand=11, in-transit=0; I expect current regime to continue. Set L to promised (default=0). Use recent_N=5 for demand because last 5 demands (Periods 11-15: 564,424,304,431,442) give mean=433.0 which captures the new higher-demand regime. Use recent_N=5 for sigma_hat (sample std \u224892.17) to reflect current volatility. These parameters raise the base-stock to meet the higher service-level implied by profit/holding tradeoff while avoiding excess inventory from older low-demand data.

Carry-over insight: Recent demand regime increased: last5 (Periods 11-15) mean=433.0, std\u224892.17; confirmed lead_time=0 from concluded periods.

Lead time has repeatedly concluded as 0 in history, so keep promised lead time. mu_hat set using recent_N=5 (periods 12-16 demands: 424,304,431,442,435) \u2192 mean=407.2 (1+L multiplier applied). sigma_hat set using recent_N=5 sample std \u224857.86 to capture current volatility. These parameters raise the base-stock to meet high short-term demand while avoiding excessive extra safety stock given confirmed short lead time.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent concluded history shows consistent lead_time=0. Demand has stepped up in the last 5 periods (Periods 13-17 demands = [304,431,442,435,640]), indicating a new high-demand regime. I set L to the promised/observed 0. For demand forecast I use recent_N=5 (captures the new regime) producing (1+L)*mean = 450.4 units. Volatility estimated from the same 5-sample window (sample std \u2248 120.37) -> sigma_hat = 120.37. These parameters raise the base-stock to reflect the higher demand while using the observed zero lead time to avoid over-ordering for pipeline.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/17. Historical concludes repeatedly confirm actual lead_time=0. Recent demand has jumped; last 5 demands (Periods 14-18 = 431,442,435,640,419) show a new high regime. On-hand=84, in-transit=0 so we must order to cover (L+1) periods. Set L to promised (0). Use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the new regime (mu_hat=(1+L)*mean_last5=473.4). Use recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect realized volatility (sample std \u224893.56 scaled by sqrt(1+L)). These parameters raise the base-stock to improve service during the higher-demand regime while sigma supports safety stock; keeping L=0 aligns with observed confirms and avoids overestimating pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead_time=0 from concluded periods; new sustained demand regime: last5 mean=473.4, sample std\u224893.56 (Periods 14-18: 431,442,435,640,419).

I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the latest regime (1+L)*mean = 406.2. I set sigma_hat using recent_N=5 (sample std scaled by sqrt(1+L) = 155.83) so the OR backend buffers for observed volatility but reflects the recent downward shift. This balances service (higher mu_hat than long-run mean) against holding cost given substantial recent variability.

Carry-over insight: Recent demand regime decreased: last5 mean=406.2, sample std\u2248155.83 (Periods 17-21: 640,419,439,301,232); confirmed lead_time=0 from concluded periods.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-07-15. On-hand=236, in-transit=0. Recent demand has declined vs prior high regime: last 5 demands (Periods 18-22) = [419,439,301,232,238], mean=325.8, sample std\u224898.27. All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 historically. I set L to promised/default (0) since concluded history consistently shows 0. For demand I use recent_N=5 to capture the recent downshift (N=5 chosen per detected changepoint covering Periods 18-22). mu_hat is (1+L)*recent_mean = 325.8 to align base-stock to the current lower regime and avoid excess holding costs; sigma_hat is recent_N sample std (sqrt(1+L)*std = ~98.27) to reflect current volatility. These parameters reduce overstock risk while maintaining service given on-hand=236 and no pipeline.

Carry-over insight: New sustained recent demand regime: last5 (Periods 18-22) mean=325.8, sample std\u224898.27; confirmed lead_time=0 from concluded periods.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-22 (Period 24). History shows consistent actual lead_time=0 across concluded periods and recent demand regime settled. Use L=promised (default 0). Demand forecast: use recent_N=5 (last 5 demands: 439,301,232,238,212) producing mean 284.4 units for the review+lead horizon (1+L). Volatility: use recent_N=5 sample std \u224892.49. These parameters keep the OR base-stock aligned to the elevated recent demand while reflecting current zero lead time to avoid excess pipeline; balances service level (capture high demand) vs holding cost by using recent regime estimates rather than older low-demand samples.

Daily Reward (R_t): $296.00

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent concluded history (Periods 1-24) consistently shows arrivals with lead_time=0. Demand has fallen in the last 5 periods (Periods 20-24 demands = [301,232,238,212,207], 5-period mean=238.0, sample std\u224837.56). On-hand=118, in-transit=0; with lead_time=0 we only need to cover the current period's demand. I set L using observed concluded lead times (calculate). For demand I use recent_N=5 to capture the recent downward regime; mu_hat=(1+L)*recent_mean -> 238.0. Sigma_hat uses recent_N=5 sample std scaled by sqrt(1+L) -> ~37.56. These parameters reduce overstock risk while maintaining service for the current lower-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: New sustained recent demand regime decrease: last5 (Periods 20-24) mean=238.0, sample std\u224837.56 (evidence demands 301,232,238,212,207); confirmed actual lead_time=0 from concluded periods.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/5 (Period 26). Historical concludes confirm actual lead_time=0 consistently. Recent demand has softened: last 5 observed demands (Periods 21-25) = [232,238,212,207,154], mean=208.6 and sample std\u224833.2. On-hand =101, in-transit=0; no arrivals pending. I set L to promised (default 0) because concluded history repeatedly shows lead_time=0. I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the new lower demand regime (reduces overstock risk) and recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect current lower volatility. These parameters steer the OR backend toward a lower base-stock appropriate for the reduced recent demand while keeping safety stock sized to observed variability.

Carry-over insight: New sustained demand-down regime: last5 (Periods 21-25) mean=208.6, sample std\u224833.2 (demands 232,238,212,207,154); confirmed actual lead_time=0 from concluded periods.

On-hand=121, in-transit=0 so we have ~0.6 periods cover at this mean.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19 (Period 28). On-hand=87, in-transit=0. Recent demand has fallen sharply over the last 5 periods (Periods 23-27: 212,207,154,102,120) \u2014 I expect this lower-demand regime to persist. Promised lead time observed historically = 0 (all concluded orders show lead_time=0), so I keep L=0. I set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the current low-demand regime (mean=159.0 for last 5 periods). I set sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to reflect the reduced volatility (sample std \u224849.77). These parameters reduce target base-stock and orders to avoid excess holding cost while preserving service given the current low-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: New sustained demand-down regime: last5 (Periods 23-27) mean=159.0, sample std\u224849.77 (demands 212,207,154,102,120); confirmed lead_time=0 from concluded periods.

Recent demand regime has dropped; using last 5 concluded demands (Periods 24-28: 207,154,102,120,158) as the most relevant signal. Choice: set L="default" (promised lead time = 0) because concluded history consistently shows lead_time=0. Set mu_hat using recent_N=5 -> (1+L)*mean(last5)=148.2 to reflect the new lower-demand regime and avoid excess holding cost given on-hand=23 and no in-transit. Set sigma_hat using recent_N=5 -> sample std(last5)=40.37 to capture current volatility. These parameters steer the OR backend toward a lower base-stock appropriate for the sustained demand drop while preserving service vs. holding-cost balance.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). Concluded history shows stable actual lead_time=0 across periods; latest demand has fallen into a low regime. Recent 5 demands (Periods 25-29 = 154,102,120,158,140) average 134.8 with sample std \u2248 23.61. On-hand=26, in-transit=0 so we must replenish to cover current-period demand (L+1). I set L='default' (promised 0) and use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new low-demand regime and avoid overstocking given holding cost >0. This balances service (cover current demand ~135 units) vs holding cost by targeting a modest base-stock estimate derived from the recent low-mean and low volatility.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/9. History shows consistent actual lead_time=0 in concluded periods and current on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent demand has trended down; last 5 demands (Periods 26-30) = [102,120,158,140,145], mean=133.0, sample std\u224822.07. I set L=default (promised 0) since concluded history confirms 0.

Carry-over insight: New sustained demand-down regime: last5 (Periods 26-30) mean=133.0, sample std\u224822.07 (demands 102,120,158,140,145); confirmed lead_time=0 from concluded periods.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-16. Historical concluded lead times consistently 0 \u2014 use promised lead time. Recent demand regime has been low: last 5 demands (Periods 26-30) = [102,120,158,140,145], mean=133.0, std\u224822.07. On-hand=2, in-transit=0 \u2014 low immediate cover. To avoid overstock while meeting current low-demand regime, set L=default (0) and use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so base-stock reflects the lowered demand and modest variability.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-23 (Period 33). Historical concluded messages consistently show actual lead_time=0. Recent demand has been in a low regime but the last 5 concluded demands (Periods 28-32 = [158,140,145,141,135]) average higher than the previously recorded trough. I set L to the promised/default (0) since concluded history confirms 0. For demand I use recent_N=5 to capture the current short-term regime; mu_hat = mean(last5) = 143.8. Volatility set from the same 5-sample recent_N (sample std \u2248 8.699) so sigma_hat = 8.699. This keeps the OR base-stock responsive to the current low-but-stable demand while avoiding excess inventory given holding cost > profit sensitivity.

Carry-over insight: New recent demand regime detected: last5 (Periods 28-32) mean=143.8, sample std\u22488.70 \u2014 use recent_N=5 until reversed.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-30 (Period 34). On-hand=1, in-transit=0. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history; recent demand regime is short-term and best captured with recent_N=5. I set L to default (promised 0). For demand I use recent_N=5 (most recent 5 demands Periods 29-33 = [140,145,141,135,147]) \u2192 mean=141.6 so mu_hat=(1+L)*mean=141.6. For volatility I use recent_N=5 (sample std \u22484.674) so sigma_hat\u22484.67. These settings keep the OR backend focused on the current low-variance recent regime and avoid overstock given holding cost.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-07. Demand has settled into the recent 5-period regime detected in Period 33 (last5 mean\u2248143.8, std\u22488.70). All concluded periods show actual lead_time=0. On-hand=38, in-transit=0. I use L='default' (promised 0) because concluded history consistently confirms lead_time=0. For demand I use recent_N=5 to capture the current regime (1+L)*mean = 143.8 units across review+lead period. For volatility I use recent_N=5 with std\u22488.70. These parameters keep the OR base-stock aligned to the low-variance recent demand, avoiding excess holding while maintaining service under the confirmed zero lead time.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/10/14 (Period 36). Historical concludes confirm actual lead_time=0 for many periods. Recent changepoint at Period 33 indicates a new lower-demand regime; last5 demands (Periods 28-32) mean=143.8, std\u22488.70. I set L to promised/default (0) because concluded history consistently shows 0. I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to target the current regime (mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_last5 = 143.8) and recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility (sigma_hat \u2248 8.7). These parameters keep base-stock tied to the observed recent mean, avoiding excess holding cost given low demand while preserving service for one-period lead time.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/10/21 (Period 37). On-hand=51, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments; historical lead_time confirmed 0 in concluded periods. Recent demand has declined sharply. I choose L=default (promised 0). For demand I use recent_N=5 to capture the new low-demand regime (Periods 32-36 demands: 135,147,106,85,84) giving mean=111.4 units for the review+lead period. Volatility estimated from the same 5 samples (sample std\u224828.73).

I set L=promised (0) because concluded history confirms same-period arrivals. Use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current low-demand regime and avoid overstock given holding cost > profit. This yields a (1+L)-period demand forecast (mu_hat) of 106.2 and empirical volatility (sigma_hat) of ~25.57 to guide the OR base-stock calculation and cap.

To avoid overstocks given holding cost=1 vs profit=2, I use a short recent window (N=5) to capture the current low mean/volatility. L uses promised lead time (0). mu_hat uses recent_N with N=5 (forecast = (1+L)*mean of last 5 demands) to keep orders aligned with the latest regime. sigma_hat uses recent_N N=5 to reflect observed short-run variability and keep safety stock modest.

Last 5 actual demands (Periods 35-39) = [85,84,109,78,61], mean=83.4, sample std\u224817.24. I adopt L=default (promised 0) because concluded history strongly confirms 0. Use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to track the new low-demand regime and avoid overstock; sigma_hat recent_N=5 to reflect current lower volatility. These parameters reduce base-stock and cap, lowering holding cost while maintaining service for the current demand level.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). Recent concluded periods show continued lead_time=0 (all concluded orders arrived same period). On-hand=22, in-transit=0 \u2014 low buffer versus recent low demand. Recent 5-period demand (Periods 36-40 = [84,109,78,61,69]) indicates a new lower-demand regime: mean=80.2, sample std\u224818.33. I set L="default" (promised 0) since concluded history consistently shows lead_time=0. For demand forecasting I use recent_N=5 to capture the new low-demand regime (mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_recent = 80.2). For volatility I use recent_N=5 (sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*sample_std = 18.33). These choices reduce ordering to match the new lower-demand regime and limit holding cost while preserving service given reliable zero lead time.

Carry-over insight: New sustained low-demand regime: last5 (Periods36-40) mean=80.2, sample std\u224818.33; confirmed actual lead_time=0 from concluded periods.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead_time=0. Recent demand has shifted to a low regime; last 5 demands (Periods 38-42) = [78,61,69,67,109], mean=76.8, sample std\u224819.01. To avoid excess holding cost while meeting near-term demand, set lead time to promised (default=0) and base forecasts to the recent-5 regime (mu_hat and sigma_hat based on last 5 samples). These parameters reduce target base-stock to match current low-demand regime and limit overstock risk given holding cost >0.

Carry-over insight: New sustained low-demand regime: last5 (Periods 38-42) mean=76.8, sample std\u224819.01 (demands [78,61,69,67,109]); confirmed actual lead_time=0 from concluded periods.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09. Recent concludes show a sustained low-demand regime (last 5 demands: Periods 39-43 = [61,69,67,109,61], mean\u224873.4, std\u224820.22). Lead_time has repeatedly concluded as 0. On-hand=24, in-transit=0 so coverage is low vs. recent demand; keep forecast tied to the recent low regime to avoid excess holding. Choose L=default (promised 0). Use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current low-demand regime and recent volatility, giving (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std respectively.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16 (Period 45). On-hand=28, in-transit=0. Historical concludes repeatedly confirm actual lead_time=0. Recent demand has dropped \u2014 last 5 periods (Periods 40-44) demands = [69,67,109,61,55], mean=72.2, sample std\u224821.29. I set L to promised/default (0) since concluded history supports lead_time=0. Use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new low-demand regime and avoid overstock given $2 profit / $1 holding tradeoff.

Carry-over insight: New sustained low-demand regime: last5 (Periods 40-44) mean=72.2, sample std\u224821.29; confirmed actual lead_time=0 from concluded periods.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (pre-Christmas) \u2014 demand has settled into the low-demand regime detected in recent periods. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0, and last 5 demands (Periods 41-45 = [67,109,61,55,64]) show a stable low mean and moderate variance. I use L="default" (promised 0) because concluded history confirms 0 lead time. For demand I use recent_N=5 to capture the current low-demand regime: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last5) = 71.2 units. sigma_hat uses recent_N=5 sample std \u224821.59 (scaled by sqrt(1+L)). These parameters keep the base-stock small to avoid holding costs while meeting the reduced demand observed.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30 (pre-holiday week). All concluded periods show actual lead_time=0. Recent demand regime is low: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 42-46) = [109,61,55,64,92], mean=76.2, sample std\u224823.22. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so order must cover this period's demand. Use L=default (promised 0). Use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained low-demand regime and keep inventory low to limit holding cost while maintaining service.
