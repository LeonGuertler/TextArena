Evaluation: Pipeline (314) is already near OR's cap; we lack confirmed early arrivals and cannot assume the Period1 order will arrive sooner.

Demand outlook: (1+L)\xd7mean = 5\xd7204.8 = 1,024 units expected over the review+lead window. Pipeline (635) + order should cover this 1,024 target plus safety.

Risk assessment: No confirmed lost shipments yet; avoid over-ordering because holding cost = $1/period but stockouts are costly (profit $4). Decision rule: top up the pipeline to cover the full expected demand over L+1 periods (1,024) to reduce stockout risk, but avoid exceeding the OR's conservative cap by too much.

  "rationale": "Lead time confirmed = 4 (already recorded). Recent demand (Periods 36\u201346) averages ~80\u201390 units/week (samples: 84,109,78,61,69,67,109,61,55,64,92 \u2192 mean \u2248 79\u201385); using 85 as conservative single-period mean \u2192 (L+1)=5 \u2192 expected demand over lead+review \u03bc\u0302 \u2248 5\xd785 = 425 units. Current on-hand = 433, in-transit = 0, so on-hand already covers the 5-period target. OR recommends 460 (based on older/higher regime), but ordering would create unnecessary holding cost ($1/unit/period) while we already have sufficient stock to meet expected demand at confirmed lead time. No evidence of incoming arrivals or lost shipments beyond known history. Action: do not order this period to avoid extra holding cost and because pipeline + on-hand \u2265 target coverage.",
