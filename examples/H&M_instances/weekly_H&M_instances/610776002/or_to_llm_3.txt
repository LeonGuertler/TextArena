Strategy: We need roughly (L+1)*expected_mean \u22485*~205=~1025 units to cover next (L+1) periods. Pipeline (635) leaves a shortfall \u2248390 units. OR's cap (~315) is conservative; given two recent high-demand observations (avg 291) I boost the order to cover a portion of the upward shift but avoid overstock if shift reverses. Final action: order 390 units now to bring pipeline+order \u22481025, covering (L+1) periods at the historical mean while partially hedging the observed higher recent demand.
