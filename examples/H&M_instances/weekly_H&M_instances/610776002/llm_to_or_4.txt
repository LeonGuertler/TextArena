Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. SKU 610776002 is a womens' basic T-shirt; no strong seasonal event this date. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 and no concluded arrivals yet so use promised lead time. Historical demands: [148,175,160,233,308] show moderate upward volatility but no clear recent changepoint. Choose L=default (use promised 4 periods) and let mu_hat and sigma_hat use defaults so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This is conservative given no evidence of lost shipments or regime shift and balances service level vs holding cost.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). On-hand=0, in-transit=314 from Period 1 order (arrival not yet concluded). No concluded arrivals exist to infer actual lead time, so use promised lead time. Historical demand samples = [148,175,160,233,308] (mean=204.8). With promised L=4, set demand across review+lead = (1+L)*mean to cover 5 periods of demand. Use default volatility estimate. This keeps the base-stock target aligned with long-run mean demand while acknowledging the outstanding in-transit shipment that may still arrive.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). Demand history samples: [148,175,160,233,308] (mean=204.8). On-hand=0, in-transit=635 (matches orders 314+321 placed in Periods 1\u20132 but not yet concluded). No concluded arrivals observed \u2192 insufficient evidence to change promised lead time; shipments appear delayed but not confirmed lost. Use default promised lead time to let OR backend compute base_stock from full-sample mean; default sigma to reflect full historical variability. This balances service (covers mean demand over review+lead) and holding cost conservatively while awaiting concluded arrivals to update lead-time inference.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/4. History: three consecutive periods (Periods 1\u20133) show orders placed but arrived=0; on-hand=0, in-transit=980. No concluded arrivals to infer actual lead time \u2014 this suggests shipments are delayed or possibly lost. To avoid stockouts during uncertain/extended lead time, I explicitly extend lead time to L=6 (conservative buffer beyond promised 4). I use default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples, scaling safety stock with the longer L. This balances service (avoid lost sales with higher safety stock) against holding cost given moderate profit/holding ratio (profit=$2, holding=$1). Reassess when a conclude message shows arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Delayed/lost shipments: orders placed in Periods 1\u20133 have not arrived (arrived=0); treat lead time as extended until arrival evidence; using L=6 as temporary regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent period concludes (Periods 1\u20134) show ordered shipments not arriving (arrived=0) despite promised L=4; evidence of extended lead time. On-hand=0, in-transit=1335 (old pipeline). Recent realized demand has jumped vs. historical sample mean (recent demands: 266,316,306,283 vs. historical [148,175,160,233,308]) \u2014 detect a higher-demand regime. Set L explicitly to 6 to hedge against observed extended lead times until arrival evidence appears. Use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility on the most recent 4 realized demands, capturing the upward demand shift and higher variability. These choices raise the base-stock to improve service under longer lead times while accounting for higher recent demand, trading higher holding cost for reduced lost sales given profit > holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Lead time appears extended/lost for orders placed in Periods 1\u20134 (no arrivals observed); adopt temporary lead-time regime L=6 until conclude messages show arrivals.

=== Period 5 Summary ===
610776002: ordered=330, arrived=314 units (ordered on Period 1, lead_time was 4 periods), starting on-hand inventory=314, demand=252, sold=252, ending on-hand inventory=62

Daily Reward (R_t): $442.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). Recent concluded message (Period 5) shows arrival=314 units (ordered Period 1, lead_time=4), so at least one order followed the promised 4-period lead time. Current on-hand=62, in-transit=1351 (matches outstanding orders minus the arrived 314). Historical demand samples = [148,175,160,233,308] (mean=204.8). No clear changepoint in demand; evidence no longer supports the temporary L=6 regime. Use promised lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes base-stock from full-sample mean/variance and the promised L, balancing service level vs holding cost while we await further conclude messages to reassess actual lead times.

Carry-over insight: Retire temporary extended lead-time regime (L=6). Period 5 conclude: arrived=314 (ordered Period 1) demonstrates actual lead_time=4 for that shipment; continue to monitor concluded arrivals for any genuine lead-time extension.

Daily Reward (R_t): $427.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). Recent concluded arrivals show shipments from Periods 1 and 2 arrived with lead_time=4, removing evidence of extended/lost lead times. Demand history (samples=[148,175,160,233,308]) has mean=204.8. On-hand=113 + in-transit=1030 provides substantial pipeline cover. Given confirmed lead_time=4, use lead-time estimate derived from observed lead times and default demand aggregation to let the OR backend compute base stock and caps. This balances service (use realized L) against holding cost given large pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Retire temporary extended lead-time regime (L=6). Concluded arrivals: Period 5 conclude arrived=314 (ordered Period 1, lead_time=4); Period 6 conclude arrived=321 (ordered Period 2, lead_time=4). Evidence supports actual lead_time=4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $634.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). On-hand=94, in-transit=836. Concluded arrivals in Periods 5\u20137 confirm orders from Periods 1\u20133 arrived with lead_time=4, so actual lead time aligns with promised L=4. Demand has been strong recently (period demands in concludes: 266,316,306,283,252,270,364) so maintain default forecasting that uses all samples; let the OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. Using default L/mu/sigma lets the backend balance service level vs holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1 while respecting pipeline coverage and avoiding overreaction to the earlier delayed shipments.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead_time=4 confirmed by concluded arrivals: Period 5 arrived=314 (ordered P1, lead_time=4); Period 6 arrived=321 (ordered P2, lead_time=4); Period 7 arrived=345 (ordered P3, lead_time=4). Retire temporary L=6 regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $667.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019/4/8). Recent concluded demands have risen to ~300 units/period (Periods 5-8 demands: 252,270,364,372) vs older low-sample history. On-hand=77, in-transit=849 (pipeline appears healthy; recent concluded arrivals show actual lead_time=4). Set L to promised lead time (default=4) because concluded arrivals from Periods 5-8 confirm lead_time=4. For demand forecast use recent_N (N=5) to capture the upward demand regime observed in the last 5 concluded periods; multiply by (1+L) downstream. For sigma use recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent demand volatility. These choices raise target base-stock to meet higher short-term demand while relying on confirmed lead time to avoid overreacting to transient past delays.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead_time=4 confirmed by concluded arrivals: Period5 arrived (ordered P1, lead_time=4); Period6 arrived (ordered P2, lead_time=4); Period7 arrived (ordered P3, lead_time=4); Period8 arrived (ordered P4, lead_time=4).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15).

Current inventory: on-hand=136, in-transit=919. Given confirmed LT=4 and stable historical demand samples [148,175,160,233,308], use default lead time and default demand estimators so the OR engine computes base stock from (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This balances service level (use confirmed LT) while avoiding manual over-adjustment for volatility or lost shipments that are not currently observed.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/29 (Period 12). Recent concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead_time=4 (Period5 arrived=ordered P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, P7 all with lead_time=4; Period11 conclude shows arrived=151 for order from P7). On-hand=0, in-transit=1259 \u2014 pipeline is large but arrivals are delayed until their conclusion periods. Use promised/confirmed lead time to keep OR engine aligned with backend assumptions and let backend compute demand aggregate and variability from full sample history. Default methods keep parameters consistent with observed stable lead_time and historical demand samples while avoiding overfitting to recent demand spikes.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). Recent concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead_time=4 (orders from Periods 1\u20138 concluded with lead_time=4). On-hand=0, in-transit=1164 (covers multiple future periods). Historical demands [148,175,160,233,308] and observed periodic demands in concludes average ~310 recently; use promised lead time (4) and default demand statistics so backend computes base-stock using full sample mean/variance. This keeps policy aligned with confirmed lead time, avoids overreacting to prior temporary delays, and balances service level vs holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead_time=4 confirmed by concluded arrivals (evidence: Periods 5\u201312 conclude show arrivals for orders placed in Periods 1\u20138 with lead_time=4).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/13 (Period 14). Recent concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead_time = 4 (orders from P1\u2013P9 concluded with W=4), so use the promised/confirmed lead time. On-hand = 96, in-transit = 1175; pipeline plus on-hand provides multi-period coverage but demand history is limited to the provided samples. Use default demand/volatility calculations so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, which balances service level (profit=2 vs holding=1) via the backend's critical fractile.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 (orders placed in Periods 1\u201310 concluded with lead_time=4). Recent demand samples = [148,175,160,233,308] (mean=204.8). Current on-hand=7, in-transit=1136 \u2014 pipeline is large relative to demand. Given confirmed lead_time=4 and stable demand samples, use default lead time and default demand stats so the OR backend computes base-stock from (1+L)\xd7sample mean and corresponding sigma. This balances service (large pipeline) vs holding cost without overreacting to past transient delays.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead_time=4 confirmed by concluded arrivals (evidence: Periods 5\u201314 conclude show arrivals for orders placed in Periods 1\u201310 with lead_time=4); retire temporary L=6 regime.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019/5/27). Recent concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead_time=4 (concludes for P5\u2013P15 confirm orders placed 1 period earlier arrive after 4 periods). On-hand=0, in-transit=1455 \u2014 pipeline is large and should cover (1+L) periods. No persistent changepoint in demand or lead time detected; revert to promised lead time. Use default demand/volatility calculations so OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7sample mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7sample std over historical demand.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). Concluded arrivals through Period 16 consistently show orders arriving with lead_time=4 (orders placed in Periods 1\u201312 have concluded with W=4), so use promised/default lead time. On-hand=0, in-transit=1376 \u2014 pipeline exceeds (1+L) periods of typical demand (mean historical demand \u2248205 \u2192 (1+4)*205\u22481025), so current pipeline should cover near-term demand while avoiding extra holding. Use default demand/volatility estimates to let OR backend compute base-stock and cap based on full sample history.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead_time=4 confirmed (evidence: Periods 5\u201316 conclude show arrivals for orders placed in Periods 1\u201312 with lead_time=4).

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=0, in-transit=1468 (covers multiple future periods). Demand history seed (provided) = [148,175,160,233,308]; use conservative default estimators so OR backend uses full sample mean/variance scaled by (1+L). Set L to promised/default=4 to match observed regime. Using default mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the OR engine compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given stable lead-time evidence and large pipeline.

On-hand=29, in-transit=1321 \u2014 pipeline is large relative to on-hand. Demand history shows high variability and elevated demand; given confirmed actual lead time equals promised lead time, use default lead-time and default demand estimators so OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over all samples. This keeps the base-stock anchored to full-sample stats while the large pipeline protects service; defaults avoid overfitting to short-term spikes.

On-hand=72, in-transit=1497 \u2014 pipeline is large relative to on-hand. No evidence of extended or lost shipments currently.

Current inventory: on-hand=336, in-transit=1206 (healthy pipeline). Given clear, repeated evidence of actual lead_time=4 and ample pipeline, set lead time by calculating observed average. Use default aggregate demand estimates for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend applies (1+L) scaling to the full sample statistics. This balances service (avoid stockouts given large pipeline) against holding cost.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29 (Period 25). On-hand=698, in-transit=835. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead_time = 4 (multiple concluded arrivals mapped to orders placed 4 periods earlier). No recent evidence of lost or extended lead-times. Demand history seed (provided samples) used by default estimators. Therefore use default lead time (promised L=4) and default demand estimators so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the supplied samples; this keeps the base-stock anchored to long-run sample statistics while the pipeline (on-hand + in-transit) already provides substantial coverage to balance service vs holding cost.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Concluded arrivals from Periods 5\u201328 consistently show orders placed earlier arriving with lead_time=4 (e.g., P5 arrived=314 ordered P1, P6 arrived=321 ordered P2, ... P28 arrived=191 ordered P24). No evidence of extended or lost shipments remains. Current inventory: on-hand=999, in-transit=479. With actual lead time confirmed at 4, use the promised/default lead time so the OR backend uses L=4. Demand data seed (historical samples) will be used by default formulas: mu_hat default = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat default = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). These default settings align the base-stock calculation with observed stable lead time and historical demand, balancing service level vs holding cost given high on-hand + pipeline.

Recent demand samples [148,175,160,233,308] seed the forecast but observed on-hand=1046 and in-transit=429 provide strong coverage. No evidence of lost or extended shipments currently. Use promised/default lead time to align with concluded evidence and let OR backend compute (1+L)-horizon demand statistics. Default mu_hat and sigma_hat let the backend use full-sample mean/std scaled by (1+L), balancing service level vs. holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

=== Period 36 Summary ===
610776002: ordered=63, arrived=121 units (ordered on Period 32, lead_time was 4 periods), starting on-hand inventory=1079, demand=84, sold=84, ending on-hand inventory=995

Daily Reward (R_t): $-827.00

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/10/21 (Period 37). Recent concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead_time=4 (orders placed in Periods 1..32 concluded with W=4); on-hand=995, in-transit=393 (pipeline healthy). Use promised/default lead time (L=4) because concluded history confirms it. Demand seed data (provided samples) mean=204.8; to cover review+lead (1+L)=5 periods use default mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean. Variability will use default sigma_hat to let OR backend compute safety stock from observed sample std. This keeps service high while avoiding excess holding given already-large on-hand inventory.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019/10/28). Recent concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead_time = 4 (orders placed in Periods 1..33 concluded with W=4), so use promised/observed lead time. On-hand = 1001, in-transit = 341; pipeline looks healthy vs. steady weekly demand (historical demand samples available). To balance service level vs. holding cost (profit $2, holding $1 \u2192 q = 2/(2+1)=0.666...), use default demand estimates so the OR backend computes base_stock from full-sample mean/std with L=promised. No evidence of ongoing lost shipments; retire the temporary L=6 regime.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead_time = 4 confirmed by concluded arrivals (Periods 5\u201337 conclude show arrivals for orders placed in Periods 1\u201333 with lead_time=4); temporary extended lead-time regime L=6 retired.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=1052, in-transit=303. Concluded arrivals through Period 38 consistently show orders arriving with lead_time=4 (orders placed in Periods 1\u201334 concluded with W=4), so use the promised/observed lead time. I choose 'default' for L so backend uses the promised lead time (4). Demand history provided is limited to the seed samples; use 'default' mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This conservative setting leverages the confirmed lead-time regime and lets the backend calculate the base-stock that balances the profit ( $2 ) vs holding cost ( $1 ) tradeoff.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11): historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead_time=4 (arrivals for orders placed P1\u2013P35 concluded with W=4). On-hand=1077, in-transit=275 \u2014 no recent lost shipments visible. No demand regime change detected. Use L=default (promised lead time=4) so backend assumes standard pipeline. Use mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level (z based on profit/(profit+holding)=2/3) against holding cost given healthy on-hand inventory and confirmed lead time.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=1071, in-transit=252. Concluded arrivals through Period 40 consistently show orders arriving with lead_time=4 (e.g. Periods 5\u201340 concludes correspond to orders placed 4 periods earlier). No evidence of lost or extended lead times currently. Demand history shows stable patterns; given confirmed actual lead_time=4, use promised/default lead time so OR backend uses L=4. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history, balancing service level vs holding cost without overreacting to short-term noise.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-933.00

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). Concluded history consistently shows arrivals for orders placed 4 periods prior (many conclude messages with lead_time=4), so actual lead time = promised lead time of 4. On-hand = 1067, in-transit = 239; pipeline plus on-hand is ample vs typical weekly demand levels. I choose L=default so backend uses promised lead time=4. I choose mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the full sample history; this leverages long-run demand stats while keeping parameter updates simple given stable lead-time evidence. This balances service (use full-sample mean) against holding cost given high on-hand inventory and confirmed stable LT.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/2 (Period 43). Recent concluded history consistently shows actual lead_time=4 (multiple concluded arrivals mapping orders to 4-period lead). On-hand=1049 and in-transit=196 provides strong coverage vs. recent weekly demands (historical demands show moderate weekly demand ~100\u2013150 in later periods). Use promised/default lead time so OR backend uses L=4. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (use full-sample mean/std scaled by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L)) so the backend's base-stock and cap reflect long-run demand estimates while leveraging observed stable lead time; this avoids overreacting to short-term variability and keeps holding costs in check given high on-hand inventory.

On-hand=1046 and in-transit=233 provide healthy coverage; no evidence of ongoing lost or extended lead-time. Use promised lead time to align with confirmed arrivals.
