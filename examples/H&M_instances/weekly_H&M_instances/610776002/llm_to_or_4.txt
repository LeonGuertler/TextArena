Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 and no concluded arrivals yet. Historical demand samples = [148,175,160,233,308] (mean \u2248 204.8). Promised lead time=4 periods; require coverage for (1+L)=5 periods. No evidence of lead-time deviations or recent demand regime change, so use default lead time and default demand estimates based on all samples. This balances service (cover ~5-period demand) against holding cost by relying on sample mean and standard deviation rather than up-weighting recent noise.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). History: past demands [148,175,160,233,308] (mean=204.8). Period 1 conclude shows the order placed in Period 1 (314 units) has arrived=0 \u2014 this is expected under promised lead time (4) because arrivals aren't visible until Period (1+L) conclude. On-hand=0, in-transit=314. I keep L at the promised/default since no concluded arrivals exist to infer a different lead time. Demand forecast uses all samples: default mu_hat = (1+L)*mean to cover review+lead period and default sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std to reflect aggregated uncertainty. These settings produce conservative base-stock sizing to balance the $2 profit vs $1 holding cost given the long promised lead time and the current in-transit volume.

Carry-over insight: Possible delayed/lost shipment: Period 1 ordered=314 arrived=0 (ordered on Period 1); monitor for conclude after Period 5 to confirm arrival or loss.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). Recent concluded history shows large demands (266, 316) and two recent orders still showing arrived=0 \u2014 possible delayed shipments but not yet past promised lead time (4). Promised lead time remains the best prior; do not overreact to missing concludes yet. Use default lead time to keep ordering aligned with promised L=4. Set demand estimates to default (use full-sample mean and std scaled by 1+L) because no clear changepoint in demand mean/variance is confirmed; this yields a base-stock that covers (1+L) periods of expected demand while the OR backend applies safety stock via z*. This balances service level against holding cost while we wait for further conclude messages to confirm any lost shipments.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04 (Period 4). Recent concluded periods show three consecutive orders (Periods 1-3) with zero arrivals and high realized demand in those same periods (266, 316, 306), suggesting lost/delayed shipments and an upward demand regime. Because no positive lead-time observations exist, I explicitly extend assumed lead time to 6 to be conservative against unseen in-transit/lost behavior. For demand I use the most recent 3 realized demands (periods 1-3) to capture the new higher mean; sigma also based on the last 3 to reflect recent volatility. These choices increase target pipeline to prioritize service (profit > holding cost) while acknowledging holding cost tradeoff.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand regime shift upward: recent demands 266,316,306 (Periods 1-3) exceed historical mean ~205; treat as new regime until contradicted. Possible lost/delayed shipments: Orders placed in Periods 1-3 concluded with arrived=0; monitor for any future concludes\u2014assume extended lead time for now.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/11 (Period 5). Recent demand shows a clear upward regime: last 4 demands = [266,316,306,283] (mean ~292) vs historical mean ~205. Three consecutive prior orders (Periods 1-3) plus Period 4 order have not concluded (arrived=0), indicating shipments are delayed or lost; do not trust promised L=4. To protect service and cover extended transit, set lead time explicitly longer. Use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new higher-demand regime (covering review+lead with chosen L). This increases target base-stock to prioritize sales while accepting higher holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed upward demand regime starting Periods 1-4: recent mean ~292 (periods 1-4) vs historical mean ~205; treat as new regime until contradicted; Multiple orders (Periods 1-4) failed to arrive (arrived=0) \u2014 assume extended lead time / supply disruption until arrival concludes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $442.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). Recent demand has shifted up: last 5 demands = 266,316,306,283,252 (mean \u2248284.6). Supply: on-hand=62, in-transit=1336; Period 5 conclude shows arrival from Period 1 with lead_time=4 (one observed concluded lead time=4). Given clear upward regime and confirmed lead time, set L by calculating observed lead times, and base demand estimates on the most recent 5 periods to capture new regime while keeping volatility from the same window.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed upward demand regime starting Period 1\u20135: recent mean \u2248284.6 (periods 1\u20135) vs historical mean \u2248205; treat as new regime until contradicted; observed lead_time=4 (Period1\u2192Period5 arrival), multiple earlier orders delayed then concluded\u2014monitor but assume lead_time=4 now.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). Recent concluded demands (Periods 1-6) show a sustained upward regime vs historical seed data: recent mean \u2248284.6 (Periods 1-5) and Period6=270, well above prior historical mean ~205. Multiple previously missing arrivals have now concluded with observed lead_time=4 (Period1\u21925, Period2\u21926). On-hand=113 and in-transit=1066 (large pipeline). To respect observed supply behavior, set lead time by averaging observed lead times, and center demand estimates on the recent high-demand regime using the last 5 concluded demands to capture current demand level and volatility. These choices increase target base-stock to avoid stockouts during the extended/high-demand regime while recognizing heavier pipeline to limit overordering.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed upward demand regime starting Period 1\u20135: recent mean \u2248284.6 vs historical mean \u2248205; treat as new regime until contradicted; observed lead_time=4 (Period1\u21925, Period2\u21926); multiple earlier delayed shipments have concluded\u2014assume lead_time=4 going forward.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Recent demand evidence shows a sustained upward regime: Periods 1-5 demands = [266,316,306,283,252], mean \u2248284.6 vs historical mean \u2248205. Multiple early orders experienced 4-period lead time; concluded arrivals show lead_time=4 for orders placed in Periods 1-3. On-hand=94, in-transit=995 so pipeline is large but supply reliability now appears to follow L=4. I set L using observed lead times (calculate). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the new higher-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, which will raise the base-stock to meet higher demand while acknowledging observed volatility. This balances service level (avoid stockouts given high pipeline and higher demand) against holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Upward demand regime confirmed starting Period 1\u20135: recent mean \u2248284.6 (Periods 1\u20135) vs historical mean \u2248205; observed lead_time=4 from concluded arrivals (Period1\u21925, Period2\u21926, Period3\u21927); treat lead_time=4 and higher demand regime as current until contradicted.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019/04/08): recent concluded history shows consistent actual lead_time=4 (Period1\u21925, 2\u21926, 3\u21927, 4\u21928). Demand has shifted up vs historical: recent demands (Periods 4\u20138 = 283,252,270,364,372) show a higher mean and volatility. Given confirmed LT=4 and an upward demand regime, set L by calculation (use observed lead times) and estimate demand & volatility from the most recent 5 periods to capture the new regime while remaining responsive to further shifts. This balances service level (capture higher mean demand over review+lead) against holding cost by using a recent sample rather than all-time mean.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead_time=4 (evidence: Period5 arrived order from Period1, Period6 from Period2, Period7 from Period3, Period8 from Period4). Upward demand regime confirmed\u2014recent demands Periods4\u20138 mean \u2248308 vs historical mean \u2248205; treat as active until contradicted.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15): recent demands remain elevated vs historical. Concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=4 (Period1\u21925,2\u21926,3\u21927,4\u21928,5\u21929). On-hand 121 + in-transit 1092 comfortably covers multiple review+lead periods, but demand regime is higher so base-stock should use recent demand. Set L to calculated average of observed lead times (4). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture current high-demand regime (Periods 5\u20139 mean \u2248305.8; backend will apply (1+L)\xd7mean). Use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead_time=4 (evidence: arrivals in Periods 5\u20139 correspond to orders from Periods 1\u20135). Upward demand regime active: recent mean over Periods 5\u20139 \u2248305.8 vs historical mean \u2248205.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=1413. Historical concludes show consistent actual lead_time=4 (orders from Periods 1\u20136 arrived after 4 periods). Demand regime shifted up \u2014 recent periods show ~306 avg (Periods 5\u20139). Set L to inferred average lead time to match concluded evidence. Use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base forecast and volatility on the latest high-demand regime (captures Periods 5\u20139). This ensures pipeline targets (1+L) periods of elevated demand while reflecting observed lead time reliability.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead_time=4 (evidence: concluded arrivals Period5\u2190P1, P6\u2190P2, P7\u2190P3, P8\u2190P4, P9\u2190P5, P10\u2190P6). Sustained upward demand regime active: recent mean \u2248306 over Periods 5\u20139 vs historical \u2248205.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29): on-hand=0, in-transit=1361. Historical concludes show consistent actual lead_time=4 (multiple Period X conclude messages: orders from P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7, P4\u2192P8, P5\u2192P9, P6\u2192P10, P7\u2192P11). Demand has shifted upward vs original history; recent demands (Periods 7\u201311 = 364, 372, 271, 310, 564) indicate a higher regime (recent mean \u2248376, though P11=564 is an extreme spike). I set L via calculate to let backend use observed lead times. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current elevated regime while keeping horizon short to react to the large spike. I use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices ensure base_stock and caps are driven by the recent high-demand regime and the empirically observed lead time, balancing service level vs holding cost given large in-transit volume.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead_time=4 (evidence: arrivals mapping P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7, P4\u2192P8, P5\u2192P9, P6\u2192P10, P7\u2192P11); Sustained upward demand regime\u2014recent demands (Periods 7\u201311) mean \u2248376 vs historical \u2248205; treat as active until contradicted.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/6 (Period 13). On-hand=0, in-transit=1556. Historical concludes show consistent actual lead_time=4 (orders from P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7, P4\u2192P8, P5\u2192P9, P6\u2192P10, P7\u2192P11, P8\u2192P12). Demand has shifted upward and is sustained in recent periods (large demands in P5\u2013P12). To reflect confirmed lead-time and recent high-demand regime, set L using observed lead times and set demand forecasts from the most recent data window to capture the new mean/volatility while keeping pipeline coverage for (1+L) periods. This increases service level given long lead time and large in-transit, while limiting excess holding by using a recent-window estimate rather than full-history smoothing.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead_time=4 based on multiple concluded arrivals mapping earlier orders to +4 periods (evidence P1\u2192P5 ... P8\u2192P12). Sustained upward demand regime active (recent periods show much higher mean vs historical).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). Demand regime has shifted materially upward since Periods 9\u201313 (recent demands: 271,310,564,424,304). Actual lead time repeatedly observed as 4 periods in concluded messages (orders from P1\u2192P5 ... P9\u2192P13). Current inventory: on-hand=96, in-transit=1652 \u2014 ample pipeline but long lead time means orders placed now arrive after 4 periods. Set L by observed evidence (calculate average observed lead times = 4). For demand forecast, use recent_N (N=5) to capture the sustained upward regime; mu_hat uses recent 5-period mean scaled by (1+L). For sigma_hat, use recent_N (N=5) to reflect current volatility. These choices align the backend base-stock target to the higher recent demand while using confirmed lead-time to avoid underordering during the supply delay.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead_time=4 (evidence: multiple concluded arrivals mapping orders +4 periods: P1\u2192P5 ... P9\u2192P13); Sustained upward demand regime active \u2014 recent demands Periods 9\u201313 mean \u2248374.6 vs historical mean \u2248205; treat as current until contradicted.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/20 (Period 15). Historical concludes show consistent actual lead_time = 4 (multiple concluded arrivals mapping orders \u2192 +4 periods). Demand has shifted up materially in recent periods (Periods 10\u201314 demands = 310, 564, 424, 304, 431). I set L to promised (default) which equals observed 4; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=5 to capture the current high-demand regime (most recent 5 demands) so the OR engine targets stock for the elevated demand while keeping volatility based on the same recent window.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/27 (Period 16). Historical concludes show consistent actual lead_time=4 (multiple concluded arrivals mapping orders +4 periods). Demand has shifted to a higher regime: recent demands (Periods 11\u201315 = 564,424,304,431,442) average \u2248433, well above long-run mean \u2248205. To match current regime and confirmed lead time, set L by calculating observed lead times and set demand estimates from the most recent 5 periods to capture the new mean and volatility. This balances service (high recent demand) against holding cost by sizing forecast over (1+L) with recent data so orders reflect current high demand rather than legacy low mean.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead_time=4 (concluded arrivals mapping orders from P1\u2192P5 ... P11\u2192P15); sustained upward demand regime active\u2014recent mean (Periods 11\u201315) \u2248433 vs historical \u2248205.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019/06/03). Historical concludes show consistent actual lead_time=4 (multiple concluded arrivals map orders \u2192 arrivals at +4 periods). Demand has shifted upward and is sustained: recent regime (approx Periods 11\u201315) shows much higher demand (mean \u2248433) vs historical mean \u2248205. On-hand=127, in-transit=1692 (pipeline large). Choose L by calculating observed lead times to reflect actual behavior. For demand forecast use recent_N over the identified upward regime (N=5) to capture the new higher mean across the review+lead window. Use recent_N for sigma_hat (N=5) to reflect recent volatility in the current regime. These choices align the OR base-stock calculation with the sustained higher demand and confirmed lead time while relying on recent data to avoid understocking given long lead times and high pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead_time=4 based on multiple concluded arrivals mapping orders to +4 periods (evidence across Periods 5\u201316). Sustained upward demand regime active; recent demands Periods 11\u201315 mean \u2248433 vs historical \u2248205; treat as current until contradicted.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). Recent periods show a sustained upward demand regime (recent 5 demands: 304,431,442,435,640 \u2192 mean \u2248450.4). Actual lead_time has been repeatedly observed = 4. On-hand=0, in-transit=1469 which is short of (1+L)*recent_mean \u22482252, so we should forecast using the recent high-demand regime. Choose L=default (use promised 4), mu_hat=recent_N with N=5 to capture the current elevated mean across the review+lead window, and sigma_hat=recent_N with N=5 to reflect recent volatility. This focuses the OR backend on servicing the higher demand while letting its cap limit control extreme ordering.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). On-hand=0, in-transit=1876. Historical concluded arrivals consistently map orders \u2192 arrivals with lead_time=4; demand has shifted to a higher regime recently (very high demands in last 5 periods). Set lead-time by observed average to capture actual supply timing. Use recent_N=5 for demand forecast and volatility to reflect the elevated, volatile recent regime (last 5 demands: 431,442,435,640,419). These parameters aim to align base-stock with elevated demand while respecting the observed 4-period transit.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24): actual lead_time has been consistently observed = 4 (multiple concluded arrivals mapping orders +4 periods). Recent demand has shifted materially upward \u2014 last 5 demands (Periods 15\u201319) = [442,435,640,419,439], mean \u2248475 with high variance. On-hand=138, in-transit=1881 \u2192 pipeline is large and covers many future periods. Choose L=default (promised 4) since concluded evidence matches promised lead time; use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained high-demand regime and higher volatility. This raises the target base-stock to meet elevated demand while the large pipeline limits urgent ordering; using recent statistics avoids understating demand given the regime shift and compensates for prior delayed shipments now resolved.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead_time=4 (evidence: multiple concluded arrivals mapping orders to +4 periods through Period 19); Sustained upward demand regime active \u2014 recent 5-period mean (Periods 15\u201319) \u2248475 with high variance.

Demand has shifted up materially (recent 5-period demands: P16\u2013P20 = [435,640,419,439,301], mean\u2248446.8) so use a recent-window forecast. On-hand=214 and in-transit=1950 provide substantial pipeline cover; keep L at promised (actual=promised) and compute mu_hat/sigma_hat from the last 5 observed demands to capture current high-mean, high-variance regime.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-08 (Period 22). Historical concludes consistently show actual lead_time = 4 (multiple arrives mapping orders +4 periods). Recent demand has shifted sharply upward; last 5 concluded demands (Periods 17\u201321) = [640,419,439,301,232] indicating a sustained higher-demand regime. To capture current supply reality use calculated lead time from observed concludes and focus forecasts on the recent high-demand regime. Set L to be inferred from observed lead times (calculate). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility to the latest regime, improving service during elevated demand while avoiding excessive safety stock beyond recent variance.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead_time=4 based on many concluded arrivals mapping orders to +4 periods (evidence across Periods 5\u201321); sustained upward demand regime active \u2014 recent 5-period mean (Periods 17\u201321) = 406.2 vs historical mean \u2248205; treat as current until contradicted.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019-07-15). Demand has been in a sustained higher regime with confirmed actual lead_time=4 from concluded arrivals. On-hand=666, in-transit=1278 \u2014 healthy pipeline but demand remains elevated; continue using observed actual lead time and recent demand to size orders. Set L by calculating the average of observed lead times (captures confirmed LT=4). Set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the current elevated 5-period demand regime and make the base-stock responsive to the new mean. Set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the recent high variance and avoid understating safety stock. This combination aligns the OR backend's base-stock with the sustained higher demand and observed lead time while keeping safety stock responsive to recent volatility.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019/7/22). On-hand=1036, in-transit=696. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead_time=4 (multiple concluded arrivals mapping orders +4 periods). Demand regime shifted upward and is sustained (recent 5-period mean >> historical mean). I set L to promised/default since observed actual lead_time=4 matches promised and is stable. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (protect service level while avoiding over-reliance on long-ago low-demand samples). This prioritizes meeting elevated demand while the OR backend applies the capped ordering rule to limit exposure to holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead_time=4 based on many concluded arrivals mapping orders to +4 periods; sustained upward demand regime (recent 5-period mean much higher than historical) \u2014 treat as active until contradicted.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/29 (Period 25). Historical concludes consistently show actual lead_time=4 (multiple concluded mappings P1\u2192P5 ... P20\u2192P24). Demand has been in a sustained higher regime vs baseline; recent 5-period mean (Periods 20\u201324) is elevated. On-hand=1275 and in-transit=250 provide strong coverage; continue using lead_time=promised (4) and base forecasts that reflect the recent high-demand regime. Choose recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-mean, high-variance regime while letting the OR engine compute pipeline-aware orders.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead_time=4 (evidence: many concluded arrivals mapping orders to +4 periods through Period 24); sustained upward demand regime active (recent 5-period mean elevated vs historical baseline).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Multiple concluded arrivals across history consistently show actual lead_time = 4 periods (orders from P1\u2192P5 ... P21\u2192P25). Current inventory on-hand 1309 + in-transit 62 = 1371 units \u2014 ample cover vs expected short-term demand but demand regime has shown large swings so use recent data. Set L to promised (default) = 4 to match confirmed actual lead time. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent demand regime and higher variability while keeping responsiveness to recent drops/spikes. This keeps the base-stock responsive (reducing stockout risk given high observed demand) but caps orders per OR engine to control holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead_time = 4 (evidence: many concluded arrivals mapping orders +4 periods through Period 25); sustained but volatile elevated demand regime observed in recent history\u2014treat as active until contradicted.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-1065.00

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/12 (Period 27). Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead_time = 4. On-hand = 1269, in-transit = 0. Recent realized demand has fallen sharply over the last 5 periods (Periods 22\u201326 demands = 238,212,207,154,102; recent mean \u2248182.6), so current demand appears lower than the earlier elevated regime. To avoid excess holding cost given large on-hand inventory, set lead-time inference from observed concludes and use a recent 5-period demand estimate for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the recent downturn. This reduces ordering aggressiveness while respecting actual lead_time=4 so arrivals align with observed pipeline timing.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead_time = 4 based on many concluded arrivals mapping orders +4 periods (evidence through Period 26). New short-term demand downturn detected: Periods 22\u201326 demands = [238,212,207,154,102], recent 5-period mean \u2248182.6 \u2014 treat as current short-run regime until contradicted.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period start 2019/8/19 (Period 28). History shows many concluded arrivals mapping orders\u2192+4 periods so actual lead_time=4 is well-supported. Recent demand has dropped vs prior elevated regime: Periods 22\u201326 demands = [238,212,207,154,102], mean \u2248182.6 (downturn). On-hand=1149, in-transit=0 (no pipeline). To avoid excess holding cost while matching the recent downturn and known LT=4, set L using observed lead times, and use recent-5 demand stats for mu_hat/sigma_hat so ordering reflects the short-run lower demand and the 1+L review horizon. This reduces overordering given zero pipeline and elevated on-hand.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead_time=4 (many concluded arrivals mapping orders to +4 periods through Period 26); new short-term demand downturn active: Periods 22\u201326 mean \u2248182.6 (vs prior elevated regime) \u2014 treat as current until contradicted.

Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead_time=4 (orders from Period t arrive in Period t+4) \u2014 use promised/default lead time. Recent demand has softened: Periods 24\u201328 demands = [207,154,102,120,158], 5-period mean \u2248148.2 and elevated variability vs earlier elevated regime. To reflect the short-run downturn while keeping responsiveness, set demand forecast based on the most recent 5 periods for both mean and volatility (recent_N, N=5). This reduces ordering to match lower recent demand and avoids excess holding cost given already-large on-hand stock.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). On-hand=851, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently map orders -> +4 periods (many periods), so actual lead_time=4 is confirmed; use promised/default lead time. Recent demand has moved into a short-term downshift: last 5 demands (Periods 25-29) = [154,102,120,158,140], mean \u2248134.8, lower than prior elevated regime. To reflect current regime, set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5). This keeps orders aligned with the recent lower demand while backend enforces service-cap via its cap.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead_time=4 (multiple concluded arrivals mapping orders to +4 periods through Period 29). New short-term demand downturn: Periods 25\u201329 demands = [154,102,120,158,140], mean \u2248134.8; treat as current until contradicted.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/9 (Period 31). On-hand=706, in-transit=0. Actual lead_time has been repeatedly confirmed as 4 in concluded history; recent demand has shifted down: Periods 25\u201329 demands = [154,102,120,158,140], mean \u2248134.8. With high on-hand and no pipeline, we should plan using the short-run downturn regime. Set L to promised/confirmed 4, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 periods to reflect the new lower mean and reduced/appropriate volatility so OR backend orders conservatively and avoids excess holding cost.

Carry-over insight: New short-term demand downturn active: Periods 25\u201329 demands = [154,102,120,158,140], recent 5-period mean \u2248134.8 (down from prior elevated regime). Confirmed actual lead_time = 4 from concluded arrivals through Period 29.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/16 (Period 32). On-hand=565, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent actual lead_time = 4 (many Period X conclude messages mapping orders \u2192 X+4). Demand has shifted to a short-term downturn: recent 5-period demands (Periods 27\u201331 = 120,158,140,145,141) mean \u2248140.8, well below the prior elevated regime. To protect service while avoiding excess holding cost given large on-hand stock, use recent-N demand estimates (N=5) to reflect the current low-demand regime; keep L as promised (default = 4) since concluded history confirms lead_time=4. Sigma estimated from recent N=5 to capture current volatility.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/23 (Period 33). On-hand=430, in-transit=153. Historical concludes show actual lead_time=4 consistently; promised lead_time=4 so use default L. Recent demand shows a short-term downturn vs prior elevated regime; I will target the recent 5-period demand regime to avoid overstock. Choose mu_hat recent_N N=5 to scale (1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 demands (captures current downturn). Use sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. This keeps orders aligned to current lower demand while the confirmed LT=4 keeps pipeline coverage appropriate.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/30 (Period 34). Recent short-term downturn: last 5 demands (Periods29\u201333) mean \u2248141.6 units/period with moderate variance. Many concluded arrivals show actual lead_time=4 historically; promised lead_time=4 remains appropriate. Current inventory: on-hand=283 + in-transit=298 = 581 units in pipeline. With L=4 (review+lead horizon =5 periods) expected demand \u22485\xd7141.6\u2248708 units \u2014 pipeline is short (~127 units). To avoid stockouts given short lead-time stability but recent lower demand, use recent_N estimates (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so forecasting reflects the downturn while keeping L at promised value to match supplier behavior observed in concludes. This balances service (avoid stockout) vs holding cost by sizing safety to recent volatility rather than long-term elevated regime.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07). Recent demand has fallen from prior elevated regime; last 5 demands (Periods 30\u201334) mean \u2248134.8. On-hand=177, in-transit=430 \u2192 pipeline=607 units. Promised lead time=4 and concluded history strongly confirms actual lead_time=4, but use promised lead time (default) so backend remains consistent. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new short-term downturn; this yields (1+L)\xd7mean based on the most recent 5 samples and volatility from the same window. This choice aligns orders to current lower demand while recognizing pipeline is slightly below 5-period demand (607 vs \u2248674), reducing overstock risk given holding cost > profit tradeoff.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/10/14 (Period 36). Historical concluded arrivals consistently map orders \u2192 arrivals +4 periods (many confirmations through Period 35) so actual lead_time = 4. Demand has moved from an elevated regime into a short-term downturn: recent demands (Periods 31\u201335 = 141,135,147,106,85) show a falling 5-period mean \u2248122.8 versus prior elevated means. On-hand=92 and in-transit=514 (pipeline sufficient) but demand softness recommends cutting forecast. Set L by calculating observed lead times; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to reflect the new short-run regime and current volatility so the OR engine reduces target base-stock and limits excess holding.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead_time = 4 (multiple concluded arrivals mapping orders to +4 periods through Period 35); new short-term demand downturn active\u2014recent 5-period mean (Periods 31\u201335) \u2248122.8, treat as current until contradicted.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/10/21 Period 37 start. Recent concluded arrivals confirm actual lead_time=4 (Period32 arrival observed in Period36 conclude). Inventory: on-hand=161, in-transit=395 (pipeline adequate but demand recently softened). Recent demand (Periods 32\u201336) = [135,147,106,85,84], mean \u2248111.4 \u2014 a clear short-term downturn vs prior elevated regimes. Set L conservative to promised lead time to match observed mapping and OR expectations. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new low-demand regime and reduce over-ordering while pipeline clears. This balances service (cover current + lead demand) against holding cost given profit=$2, holding=$1.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead_time=4 based on concluded arrivals through Period36; new short-term demand downturn active: Periods 32\u201336 mean \u2248111.4 (evidence: demands [135,147,106,85,84]).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Actual lead_time has been consistently observed = 4 (multiple conclude messages). Recent demand shows a short-term downturn: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 32\u201336) average \u2248111.4 vs prior elevated regime. Current inventory: on-hand=197, in-transit=279 (pipeline covers ~2\u20133 periods of recent demand). To respond I use L=default (promised=4) since actual=4 is confirmed; forecast demand across review+lead based on the recent 5-period downturn (recent_N N=5) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 samples; sigma_hat also set from last 5 samples to capture current lower volatility. This keeps target base-stock low to avoid excess holding cost while protecting service with observed lead time and recent demand regime.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). Historical concludes consistently show actual lead_time = 4; recent demand has entered a short-term downturn. Last 5 concluded demands (Periods 34\u201338) = [106,85,84,109,78], mean = 92.4. On-hand=251 + in-transit=227 = 478 units in pipeline. With L=4, review+lead horizon = 5 periods; (1+L)*recent_mean \u2248 462 units \u2014 pipeline roughly covers this forecast, so use recent 5-period demand to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. Methods: L use promised/default=4 (consistent with observed concludes); mu_hat use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current downturn; sigma_hat use recent_N (N=5) to reflect reduced recent volatility. This balances service (cover ~5 periods of lowered demand) while avoiding excessive holding cost given elevated inventory.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead_time = 4 (multiple concludes mapping orders to +4 periods through Period 38); New short-term demand downturn active: recent 5-period mean (Periods 34\u201338) = 92.4 vs prior elevated regimes \u2014 treat as current until contradicted.

Recent demand has moved into a short-term downturn: last 5 realized demands (Periods 35\u201339) = [85,84,109,78,61], mean \u224883.4 and low volatility. To match current regime and the confirmed L=4, set L using observed lead times and forecast demand using the most recent 5-period regime so the OR backend sizes base stock to cover (1+L) review+lead demand while keeping holding cost low. sigma_hat uses the same recent 5 sample window to reflect reduced volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-101.00

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/18 (Period 41). Historical concludes show stable actual lead_time = 4 (multiple concluded mappings Pn\u2192Pn+4). Recent demand has fallen from prior elevated regime; most recent 5-period demands (Periods 36\u201340) = [84,109,78,61,69], mean \u224880.2. On-hand = 239, in-transit = 126 (pipeline covers some upcoming demand). To avoid overstocking in the current short-term downturn, set lead time to promised (default=4) and base demand forecast using the most recent 5 samples. Use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=5) so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the recent weak-demand regime. This balances service vs holding cost given profit=$2, holding=$1 (favor lower safety stock during downturn).

Carry-over insight: Short-term demand downturn active: Periods 36\u201340 demands = [84,109,78,61,69], recent 5-period mean \u224880.2; actual lead_time=4 continues to be confirmed by concluded arrivals through Period 40.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). Recent history shows confirmed actual lead_time=4 and a short-term demand downturn: recent 5 demands (Periods 37\u201341 = 109,78,61,69,67) have mean \u224876.8, well below earlier elevated regimes. On-hand=201 + in-transit=151 gives pipeline coverage; to avoid excess holding cost while maintaining service with L=4, I use recent-N estimates (N=5) for demand mean and volatility so the OR backend targets inventory appropriate for the current low-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Short-term demand downturn active: recent 5-period demands (Periods 37\u201341) mean \u224876.8 vs historical mean \u2248205; confirmed actual lead_time=4 by concluded arrivals through Period 41.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). Historical concludes confirm actual lead_time=4 and a recent short-term demand downturn: recent 5-period demands (Periods 38\u201342) = [78,61,69,67,109], mean=76.8. On-hand=172, in-transit=122 \u2192 pipeline covers some demand but with L=4 we must plan for 5-period coverage. Choose L=default (promised lead time=4). Set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current downturn ((1+L)*recent_mean \u22485*76.8=384). Set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices align base-stock to the observed low-demand regime while respecting confirmed lead time and avoiding excess inventory during the downturn.

Carry-over insight: Short-term demand downturn active: recent 5-period mean (Periods 38\u201342) = 76.8 vs historical mean \u2248205; confirmed actual lead_time=4 by concluded arrivals through Period 41.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/9 (Period 44). Historical concludes consistently show actual lead_time=4 (many orders from Period t arriving in t+4); recent demand has shifted to a short-term downturn: last 5 demands (Periods 38\u201342) = [78,61,69,67,109], mean=76.8. On-hand=111, in-transit=231 gives pipeline cover but demand is low recently; to avoid excess holding cost, set L=default (promised 4) while basing demand forecast and volatility on the recent 5-period regime. Using recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat captures the current low-demand regime and reduces order quantities to limit inventory holding costs given profit=$2, holding=$1.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead_time=4 (evidence: many concluded arrivals mapping orders from Period t\u2192t+4 through Period 41). New short-term demand downturn active: recent 5-period demands (Periods 38\u201342) mean=76.8 vs historical mean\u2248205; treat as current until contradicted.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/16 (Period 45). Recent history confirms actual lead_time = 4 (many concluded arrivals mapping orders t\u2192t+4). Demand has entered a short-term downturn: recent 5 demands (Periods 40\u201344) = [69,67,109,61,55], mean \u224872.2, well below historical average. Inventory: on-hand=73, in-transit=259 \u2192 pipeline=332 units; expected (1+L)=5 period demand \u2248361 (using recent mean) so pipeline is slightly short for the downturn-adjusted demand horizon. Set L to promised/default (confirmed =4). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to make the OR backend target the current low-demand regime and avoid excess holding given holding cost > unit profit tradeoff.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead_time=4 (evidence: many concluded arrivals mapping orders t\u2192t+4 through Period 41+); New short-term demand downturn active: Periods 40\u201344 demands = [69,67,109,61,55], recent 5-period mean \u224872.2 \u2014 treat as current until contradicted.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (Period 46). Recent history shows a sustained short-term demand downturn (recent 5-period mean \u224872.2 for Periods 40\u201344) and actual lead_time consistently observed = 4 from concluded arrivals. On-hand=63, in-transit=255 (pipeline adequate but monitor arrivals). Set L by calculate to reflect observed lead_time=4 from concluded arrivals. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to target the current short-run downturn (keeps forecast and safety stock responsive to lower demand and reduces holding cost risk).

Daily Reward (R_t): $162.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/30 (Period 47). Historical concludes consistently show actual lead_time = 4 (many t\u2192t+4 mappings through Period 46). Recent demand has fallen from prior elevated regime; last 5 demands (Periods 42\u201346) = [109,61,55,64,92], recent 5-period mean \u224876.2 and elevated relative variance. On-hand=22 + in-transit=263 => pipeline inventory covers several periods but upcoming demand is low. I set L to default (promised 4) because concluded history confirms lead_time=4 and the backend expects promised L. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to make the OR engine forecast (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility based on the most recent short-term downturn, reducing order quantities to avoid excess holding cost while preserving service. This balances profit vs holding cost given Profit=$2 and Holding=$1/unit/period and current low demand signal.
