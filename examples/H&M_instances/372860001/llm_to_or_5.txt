Period 1 (2019-03-18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019-03-18). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. No late arrivals observed in history; use promised lead time. Demand history (5 samples) shows mean=631.2 units/period and sample std \u2248161.9. Using default formulas with L=1: mu_hat=(1+L)*mean=2*631.2=1262.4 to cover review+lead demand; sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std\u2248\u221a2*161.88=228.9 to reflect demand uncertainty over the review+lead window. These settings give the OR backend a baseline service-focused base-stock while the capped order limit will curb overly large replenishments given holding cost.

Period 2 (2019-04-01) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 (2019-04-01). On-hand=0, in-transit=929 (matches the order placed previously) but Period 1 concluded showing ordered=929 arrived=0 \u2014 missing arrival could indicate delays/loss but we have no observed concluded lead-times to change promised LT. Use promised LT=1. Demand history (samples=[486,574,559,947,590]) shows mean=631.2 and std\u2248160.62; scale for review+lead (1+L=2) to get mu_hat and sigma_hat. These settings keep service targets driven by observed demand while the capped OR cap will limit extreme ordering given holding cost=$1 vs profit=$2.

Carry-over insight: Missing arrival: 929 units ordered earlier did not show as arrived in Period 1 conclusion; monitor for a delayed or lost shipment.

Period 3 (2019-04-15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15 (Period 3). Historical observed lead time = 1 (Period 2 concluded: arrival from Period 1 had LT=1). On-hand 225 + in-transit 474 = 699 units in pipeline; demand history (samples = [486,574,559,947,590]) has mean 631.2 and std ~161.87. Using promised LT=1 (no evidence to extend LT beyond the single observed LT=1), I apply defaults: L=1, mu_hat = (1+L)*mean = 2*631.2 = 1262.4 to cover the two-period review+lead demand, and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std = sqrt(2)*161.874 \u2248 228.95. These settings raise the base-stock to target higher availability given high recent demand variability (the 947 spike) while the capped-order limit in the OR engine will restrain extreme replenishment; this balances service level vs holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

Period 4 (2019-04-29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 4). History shows observed lead times of 1 in concluded Periods 2 and 3 (orders placed in Period 1\u2192arrived Period 2; Period 2\u2192arrived Period 3). Current in-transit (711) matches the Period 3 order, no new evidence of lost/delayed shipments. I use L=1 (default/promised). Demand history (samples = [486,574,559,947,590]) has mean 631.2 and std ~161.88; with review+lead factor (1+L)=2 this yields mu_hat = 2 * 631.2 = 1262.4 and sigma_hat = sqrt(2) * 161.88 \u2248 228.9. These default choices keep the OR backend's base-stock calculation aligned with observed demand and the confirmed 1-period lead time, providing service while limiting excess holding given holding cost = $1 and profit = $2.

Period 5 (2019-05-13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
History shows consistent observed lead times = 1 (Period2\u20134 arrivals all had LT=1); Period1 missing arrival was delayed but subsequently arrived in Period2, so no sustained LT regime change. Use promised/default L=1. Demand history (samples [486,574,559,947,590]) gives mean=631.2 and sample std\u2248181.01; with L=1 set mu_hat=(1+L)*mean=1262.4 and sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std\u2248256.0. These parameters keep the OR engine's base-stock tied to empirical demand while keeping safety via sigma to cover observed volatility and the one delayed shipment.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1150.00

Period 6 (2019-05-27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent concluded periods (P1\u2013P5) show consistent realized lead times of 1 (arrivals in P2..P5 came from orders placed in prior period). Demand over the last three concluded periods (P3\u2013P5 = 735, 705, 623) shows a modest downward shift from earlier levels; I use that recent regime to avoid overstating mean. Therefore: use promised LT=1 (default). Set mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) -> (1+L)*mean(last 3 demands) to capture the current demand level. Set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=3) -> sqrt(1+L)*std(last 3) to reflect observed volatility in the recent regime. This raises safety relative to a single-period forecast while avoiding carrying excessive inventory given holding cost = $1 and profit = $2.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1197.00

Period 7 (2019-06-10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-06-10). On-hand 137, in-transit 607. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent 1-period actual lead times after the one delayed arrival (Period1 arrival missing then observed in Period2); therefore use promised lead time L=1. Demand history (provided sample set: [486,574,559,947,590]) has mean 631.2 and population std \u2248161.87. Using default formulas (1+L factor): mu_hat = 2 * 631.2 = 1262.4 to cover the review+lead period; sigma_hat = sqrt(2) * 161.87 \u2248 228.9 to reflect volatility over the same window. These conservative defaults keep base-stock centered on recent long-run mean while the inflated sigma for the 2-period window raises safety stock to protect service given occasional high demand spikes and the earlier delayed shipment.

Period 8 (2019-06-24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
All concluded arrivals show consistent observed lead time 1 (orders from Period t arrive in Period t+1). On-hand=116, in-transit=665. I use L=promised (1). I compute mu_hat and sigma_hat from all concluded period demands (Periods 1\u20137: [744,704,735,705,623,667,628]) to capture full recent history: mean demand=686.571, mu_hat=(1+L)*mean=1373.142. Sample std of demands \u224848.548; sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std \u224868.682. These parameters let the OR backend set a base-stock around expected 2-period demand with safety from observed variability; given profit $2 and holding $1 this balances service vs holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1037.00

Period 9 (2019-07-08) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-08 (Period 9). Promised LT=1 and historical concluded arrivals show a stable lead-time of 1 in all observed periods (Period2\u20138), so keep L=1. Recent demand has settled below earlier high spikes; the last 5 concluded demands (Periods 4\u20138 = 705,623,667,628,606) form a more relevant regime than older outliers. I use recent_N=5 to capture this regime: mean demand \u2248 645.8 over one period, so (1+L)*mean = 2*645.8 = 1291.6 for the review+lead demand. Volatility computed from the same 5 samples (sample std \u2248 39.92) scaled by sqrt(1+L)=\u221a2 gives sigma_hat \u2248 56.45. These parameters lower target stock versus using older large spike(s), reducing holding cost while preserving service for the current lower-demand regime. On-hand=175 and in-transit=619 are consistent with maintained service; no new sustained lead-time issues detected.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1201.00

Period 10 (2019-07-22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Promised LT=1 and concluded arrivals in Periods 2\u20139 all show lead_time=1 (initial Period 1 arrival was late but then consistent). Demand recent history (Periods 1\u20139) shows stable level around mean\u2248675 units/period. On-hand=129 + in-transit=522 => pipeline=651. I use default methods: L=promised (1) because observed lead times since the initial late arrival are consistently 1; mu_hat computed as (1+L)*mean(all 9 historical demands) to capture demand over review+lead; sigma_hat as sqrt(1+L)*std(all 9 demands) to reflect observed volatility. These parameters give the OR backend a base-stock calibrated to observed demand and keep safety stock moderate given stable 1-period lead time, while pipeline inventory is accounted for by the engine's capped ordering rule.

Period 11 (2019-08-05) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 11). On-hand=118, in-transit=735. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent observed lead time = 1 (every concluded arrival was 1 period after order); the earlier missing arrival (Period 1 order) was delivered in Period 2, so no persistent lead-time shift observed. Use promised lead time (L=1). Demand samples provided ([486,574,559,947,590]) give mean=631.2 and std\u2248161.86; with (1+L)=2, set mu_hat = 2 * mean = 1262.4 and sigma_hat = sqrt(2) * std \u2248 229.0. These settings reflect current stable LT and historical demand dispersion so the OR backend's base-stock and cap calculations balance service (profit=2 vs holding=1) without overstating safety stock for unobserved delays.

Period 12 (2019-08-19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-08-19): observed lead times in concluded history are consistently 1 period (every concluded arrival shows lead_time=1). On-hand=294, in-transit=517; no new sustained lost-delivery signal (earlier missing arrival subsequently arrived). I use the promised/default lead time. I compute mu_hat and sigma_hat from all 11 concluded demand samples (periods 1\u201311: mean demand=652.63636, sample std=65.7806). With L=1, mu_hat=(1+L)*mean=2*652.63636=1305.2727 and sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std=sqrt(2)*65.7806=93.0479. These parameters keep base-stock centered on recent average demand over the review+lead window while reflecting observed variability; using defaults avoids overreacting to the one earlier delayed arrival.

Period 13 (2019-09-02) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02. History of concluded periods shows consistent observed lead times = 1 (every concluded arrival tied to an order had lead_time 1); the earlier missing arrival from Period 1 was resolved in Period 2 and there's no new missing/delayed arrival in concluded periods. On-hand=288, in-transit=547. Use promised lead time (L=1). Demand sample mean = 631.2 (samples [486,574,559,947,590]); default formulas: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean \u2192 1262.4 to cover review+lead demand; sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(samples) \u2192 228.95 to reflect observed volatility. These conservative defaults keep the OR engine's base-stock tied to recent empirical mean/variance while honoring promised LT and avoiding over-adjustment for an isolated past missing shipment.

Period 14 (2019-09-16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
No new news; historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead time=1 in all observed periods (arrivals linked to orders with lead_time=1). I use promised/default L=1. Demand history provided (samples mean=631.2) shows no recent changepoint, so I use default mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_all = 2*631.2 = 1262.4. Volatility: std(all samples)=162.48, scaled by sqrt(1+L)=\u221a2 \u2192 sigma_hat = 229.77. These defaults keep the OR engine's base-stock focused on historical mean demand over the review+lead period while reflecting observed variability; no carry-over adjustments needed for lost shipments.

Period 15 (2019-09-30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-30 (Period 15). Recent demand has softened versus earlier periods; last 5 concluded demands (Periods 10\u201314 = 533, 559, 523, 528, 653) show a lower mean and moderate dispersion. Lead-time history: all observed concluded arrivals indicate a 1-period lead time (recent sequences show lead_time=1 consistently). No new evidence of lost shipments. I set L to the promised lead time (1). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the apparent downward regime: mu_hat = (1+L) * mean(last 5) = 2 * 559.2 = 1118.4. Volatility estimated from the same recent window: sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L) * std(last 5) \u2248 1.4142 * 48.51 = 68.6. These choices lower the target base-stock to reflect the recent lower demand while keeping safety stock for observed variability and the 1-period lead time, balancing service vs holding cost.

The earlier missing arrival (Period 1 order missing in Period 1 conclusion, arrived in Period 2) resolved and all subsequent observed lead times = 1. Use promised LT=1. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat from full-sample defaults scaled for review+lead (1+L) to give the OR engine a representative forecast and reasonable safety stock given occasional variability.

Period 17 (2019-10-28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-10-28). On-hand=28, in-transit=751. Promised LT=1 and concluded periods consistently show observed lead times = 1 (arrivals in each conclude correspond to orders placed one period earlier; the earlier missing arrival in Period 1 subsequently arrived in Period 2). No convincing demand regime shift in available samples. Use defaults to let OR engine combine mean/variance with cost ratio. Defaults: L=promised(1) to reflect stable observed LT; mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples) computed from provided demand samples [486,574,559,947,590]. These parameters raise target base-stock to cover one-period lead plus review, while sigma scales uncertainty over the same horizon.

Demand sample set provided (486,574,559,947,590) shows mean=631.2; apply default (1+L)*mean -> mu_hat=1262.4. Use default volatility scaling: sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples) = 228.9.

Period 19 (2019-11-25) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25. Historical concluded arrivals show a consistent observed lead time of 1 period (all concluded arrivals map to orders placed one period earlier). On-hand=337, in-transit=508. No new sustained changepoint in demand or lead time detected. Use promised LT=1 (default). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using defaults so OR backend uses full-sample mean/variance scaled by (1+L): mean(demands) = 631.2 \u2192 mu_hat = (1+1)*631.2 = 1262.4. Sample std \u2248 181.0, scaled by sqrt(1+L) gives sigma_hat \u2248 256.0.

LLM Rationale:

Historical concluded arrivals show consistent observed lead time = 1 (every concluded arrival tied to prior-period order had lead_time 1); the earlier missing arrival was subsequently delivered in Period 2 so no persistent delay signal. Demand samples provided (486,574,559,947,590) give mean=631.2 and std\u2248180.28. Promised LT=1 is supported by history, so use default lead time. Use default mu_hat = (1+L)*mean and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std to reflect review+lead demand and observed variability; this keeps the OR engine's base-stock calculation aligned with recent demand while letting its capped cap limit moderate orders given holding cost.

Period 21 (2019-12-23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23. On-hand=357, in-transit=488. Historical concluded lead-times are consistently 1 period (all observed arrivals tied to prior-period orders had lead_time=1); the early missing arrival (Period 1) subsequently arrived with LT=1 and no further misses are observed. Demand sample set provided is [486,574,559,947,590] (mean=631.2, std\u2248161.85). I use the promised lead time (L=1) and default formulas so the OR backend computes base_stock from (1+L)*mean and scales volatility by sqrt(1+L). This keeps parameters aligned with observed stable LT and the sample demand distribution while the carry-over missing-arrival alert remains monitored.

Carry-over insight: Period 2: Missing arrival: 929 units ordered earlier did not show as arrived in Period 1 conclusion; monitor for a delayed or lost shipment.
