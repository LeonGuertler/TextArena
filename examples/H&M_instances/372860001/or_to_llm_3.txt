Using initial samples from train.csv: /Users/tianyipeng/Documents/Operations_Research_Code/25-11-supply-chain-agent/OR_Agent/examples/H&M_instances/372860001/train.csv
  Samples: [486, 574, 559, 947, 590]
  Mean: 631.2, Count: 5
Promised lead time (used by OR, shown to LLM): 1 periods (1 period = 14 days)
Note: OR uses promised lead time for recommendations. Actual lead times in CSV may differ.
      LLM must infer actual lead time from arrivals and adjust OR recommendations accordingly.

{
  "rationale": "Date 2019-03-18: no external news suggesting demand shift; SKU is basic socks (stable, not seasonal right now). Historical sample mean demand = 631 units/period, sample std \u2248 181. Promised LT=1 with no concluded arrivals yet, so no evidence of lead-time drift. OR recommended 929 (capped policy). OR's baseline is higher than the news-free basestock (\u03bc\u0302 + z*\u03c3\u0302 \u2248 631 + 0.431\xb7181 \u2248 709) because OR applies its cap/lead-time adjustments. Given zero on-hand/pipeline, I start from the OR baseline but reduce to the news-consistent basestock to limit high holding costs: order = 709 units. This matches the calculated service-oriented basestock (balances profit vs. holding cost) and avoids excess ending inventory that would reduce R_t under the current demand outlook.",
