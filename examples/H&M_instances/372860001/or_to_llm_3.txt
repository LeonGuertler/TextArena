  "rationale": "Date 2019-03-18: no special seasonal event detected for basic cotton trainer socks. Historical sample mean demand \u2248631 units (samples: 486,574,559,947,590); demand variance moderate with one high outlier (947). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so full unmet exposure. OR recommends 929 units (capped baseline using promised LT=1 and higher safety-stock). I believe the OR recommendation is biased upward by the high outlier and an aggressive safety factor. Given profit=$2 vs holding=$1 (service quantile q=2/3 \u2192 z\u22480.43) and promised LT=1, a target closer to the empirical mean plus modest safety is preferable to avoid high holding cost. I choose 700 units: this covers expected demand (~631) plus a conservative buffer for variability while limiting holding cost if demand stays near its typical level. This balances service-level goals and holding-cost sensitivity.",

Evidence: history shows consistent 1-period lead time (multiple concluded periods where orders arrive one period later); recent realized demand has moderated around ~687 units/period (carry-over estimate). Inventory: on-hand=0, pipeline=150 (order from Period 9). OR recommends 841 (uses promised LT and higher service target). Interpretation & decision: with LT=1 I expect the 150 in-transit to arrive for Period 10 demand; target stocking \u2248 expected demand (~687) to balance profit vs holding cost (profit=$2, holding=$1 favors service but not large overstocks). Therefore I order 537 = 687 demand forecast \u2212 150 pipeline so expected available \u2248687.
