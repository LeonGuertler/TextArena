Any order placed now (LT=1) will arrive next period and cannot help Period 15. e) Order logic: to cover expected next period demand (~580\u2013600) and provide a small safety buffer given demand variability, place an order of 600 units (arrives Period 16) to restore stock for the next period while avoiding excessive holding cost.",
