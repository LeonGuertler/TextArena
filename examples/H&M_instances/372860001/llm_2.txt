That 30 is expected to arrive for Period16 demand but not for Period17. Forecast: next-period demand \u2248580 (rounded from recent mean, allow for some variability). Ordering logic: holding cost is high ($1/unit/period) relative to profit ($2/unit) so avoid excess stock; we should order to cover expected demand in the next period (Period17) only. Expected starting inventory for Period17 will be 0 (the 30 in-transit will be consumed in Period16). Therefore place order \u2248580 to meet Period17 demand while minimizing holding cost.",
