No recent periods to indicate a regime shift. c) Lead time: supplier promised LT=1; no concluded periods showing arrivals yet, so no evidence LT has changed or orders lost. d) Inventory & pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Because of sequencing, any order placed now will NOT arrive for Period 1 demand (arrivals occur after decision for orders placed in earlier periods). Order placed now will be expected to arrive before demand in Period 2 assuming LT=1. e) Order logic: forecast next-period demand \u2248 historical mean 631. Holding cost = $1/unit/period vs profit = $2/unit; ordering to meet expected demand maximizes profit while avoiding excess inventory. Place order to cover expected Period 2 demand (rounded).",

Historical seed samples align with mid-high 500s. Lead time vs missing orders: history repeatedly shows orders placed one period prior arriving next period (many concluded periods with ordered -> arrived = LT=1). Use only concluded arrivals to infer LT=1; no overdue/lost orders in history. Inventory & pipeline: on-hand=67, in-transit=546 (this in-transit was ordered in Period 17 and will arrive for current-period demand, giving available stock ~613 for Period 18 demand). Forecast & decision logic: expected Period 18 demand \u2248558 < available 613, so no order required now. Ordering now would arrive next period and risk excess holding cost ($1/unit/period) relative to profit ($2/unit), so defer ordering until we observe actual shortfall.
