{
  "rationale": "a) Date/context: Period 1 (2019-03-18). No holiday/season signal for mid\u2010March affecting womens socks. b) Demand regime: historical unified samples for SKU 372860001 = [486, 574, 559, 947, 590]; mean \u2248 631 units/14\u2010day period, some variance (one high 947). No evidence of regime shift in provided history. c) Lead time: supplier promised LT=1 but no concluded periods showing arrivals yet; per playbook we cannot infer any change \u2014 assume LT=1 for planning. d) Inventory/pipeline: on\u2010hand 0, in\u2010transit 0, no overdue or in\u2010flight arrivals. e) Order logic: with LT=1, an order placed now will arrive for Period 2 demand. Use the historical mean demand \u2248631 as a point forecast for the next period. Given profit $2/unit and holding $1/unit/period (moderate holding cost) and no evidence of rising demand, order to cover expected next\u2010period demand while avoiding large overstock that would incur holding penalties.",
