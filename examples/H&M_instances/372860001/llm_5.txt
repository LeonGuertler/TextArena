Inventory/pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=0, so no arrivals will satisfy upcoming demand this period; order placed now will arrive after this period (given LT=1) and so is for future periods. Final order logic: balance expected demand (~631) against high per-period holding cost ($1 vs profit $2). Order approximately one period's expected demand to meet next-period sales while limiting holding cost exposure. Rounded order: 630 units.",

Lead time vs. missing orders: History shows Period 1 concluded: ordered=630, arrived=0 \u2014 no concluded arrivals yet, so we have NO evidence that promised LT=1 delivered; cannot assume arrival will occur this period.

Given sequencing, any order placed now will not help meet current Period 2 demand. Economics: profit = $2/unit, holding = $1/unit/period. Holding cost is high relative to profit, so overstock is costly. Final order logic: be conservative \u2014 do not add inventory before confirming the outstanding shipment.
