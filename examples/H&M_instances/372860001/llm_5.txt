{
  "rationale": "a) Date/news: Period 1 = 2019-03-18 (no special holiday signal for this SKU). b) Demand regime: Use provided historical samples [486,574,559,947,590] -> mean = 631 units/14-day period; no additional evidence of regime change. c) Lead time: supplier promised LT=1; no concluded periods exist to contradict this, so assume LT=1 for planning but do NOT expect arrivals this current period (orders placed now will arrive next period). d) Inventory & pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=0; cannot satisfy Period 1 demand (arrivals step already passed for any new order). e) Order logic: demand expected ~631 next period; holding cost is high (1$/unit/period) versus profit 2$/unit, so avoid meaningful overstock. Place an order to approximately expected demand (631 units) to serve upcoming period while limiting holding exposure.",
