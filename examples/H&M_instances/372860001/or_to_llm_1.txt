  Samples: [486, 574, 559, 947, 590]
  Mean: 631.2, Count: 5
Promised lead time (used by OR, shown to LLM): 1 periods (1 period = 14 days)
Note: OR uses promised lead time for recommendations. Actual lead times in CSV may differ.
      LLM must infer actual lead time from arrivals and adjust OR recommendations accordingly.

{
  "rationale": "Date/news: Period 1 (2019-03-18), no special seasonal signal for basic socks. Demand evidence: historical sample mean = 631.2 units (samples: 486,574,559,947,590); variance moderate with one high outlier (947). Lead time: supplier promised LT=1 and no concluded periods exist to contradict it, so assume LT=1 for now. OR recommendation: baseline (capped) = 929 units \u2014 it targets a high base-stock using historical stats and promised LT. Decision: with on-hand=0 and in-transit=0 we need to cover expected period demand ~631 while avoiding excessive holding cost (holding $1 vs profit $2 implies q\u22480.667, moderate service level). I scale OR down because 929 seems high relative to mean and would incur substantial holding cost if demand stays near historical mean; ordering ~650 balances service and holding cost for one 14-day period with LT\u22481. Final qty covers ~1.03\xd7mean, retains some buffer for variability while avoiding large overstock relative to profit/holding tradeoff.",
