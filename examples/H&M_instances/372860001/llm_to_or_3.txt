Period 1 (2019-03-18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019-03-18). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no arrivals visible. Historical demands = [486,574,559,947,590]; mean=631.2, population std\u2248161.869. Promised lead time = 1 and no concluded periods to contradict it. I use default methods so the OR backend sees demand over review+lead (1+L) periods. I keep L at the promised value (1) because the history contains lead-time observations only via concluded-period records and none indicate drift. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat based on all samples (not downweighting the 947 spike) to reflect overall demand and elevated variability; this raises safety stock to protect service rate given profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 2 (2019-04-01) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 (2019-04-01). One outstanding order of 929 placed in Period 1 has not yet arrived at Period 1 conclude \u2014 a single missed arrival so far but not enough evidence to lengthen lead time. Demand history (5 samples) shows mean 631.2 and sample std ~181.0. Use promised LT=1 (default) so review+lead = 2 periods. Set mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_all = 2*631.2 = 1262.4 to cover expected demand over review+lead. Set sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std_all = sqrt(2)*181.0 = 256.0 to reflect observed variability. These parameters keep the OR backend\u2019s base-stock driven by observed demand while the larger sigma preserves service during possible arrival variability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1183.00

Period 3 (2019-04-15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15 (Period 3). Demand history shows five samples (486,574,559,947,590) with mean 631.2 and sample std ~181.0. Current inventory: on-hand 225, in-transit 474 (this 474 is the order placed in Period 2). History shows one observed arrival with lead_time=1 (Period 2: ordered on Period 1, arrived in Period 2). No overdue/lost shipments evident in concluded periods. I use promised lead time (L=1) because observed arrivals match the promise. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the default formulas to let the OR engine compute base-stock and the capped order: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(history) = 2*631.2 = 1262.4 to cover the two-period review+lead window; sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(history) = sqrt(2)*181.0 = 256.0 to reflect observed variability. These settings balance service (profit $2 vs holding $1 implying moderate service target) while accounting for the single-period lead time and current pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Observed lead time = 1 period (Period 2 conclude: ordered on Period 1, arrived in Period 2).

Period 4 (2019-04-29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 4). History shows consistent observed lead time = 1 (arrivals in Periods 2 and 3 were 1-period lag). On-hand=0, in-transit=711 (this is pipeline from Period 3 order). No evidence of demand regime shift; use full-sample statistics from past demands [486,574,559,947,590]. Therefore keep L at promised 1. Set mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(demand) = 2 * 631.2 = 1262.4 to cover demand over review+lead. Use sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(demand) = sqrt(2)*161.87 = 228.9 to reflect observed volatility. These parameters keep the OR engine\u2019s base-stock aligned with recent average demand while preserving safety stock for observed variance and the 1-period lead time; no new carry-over insight.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1404.00

Period 5 (2019-05-13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13 (Period 5). On-hand = 6, in-transit = 713. Promised lead time = 1; observed arrivals in concluded periods 2\u20134 show lead time = 1 consistently (orders placed in Periods 1\u20133 arrived one period later). Demand history (samples) mean ~631.2, std ~181.0. No clear recent demand regime shift. Use default methods: L=promised (1) to reflect stable observed LT; mu_hat = (1+L)*mean to cover review+lead demand; sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std to reflect aggregate variability. This balances service (reasonable base-stock) vs holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed = 1 based on arrivals in Periods 2\u20134 (orders on Periods 1\u20133 each arrived after 1 period).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1150.00

Period 6 (2019-05-27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Promised lead time has been consistently observed as 1 in concluded periods 2\u20135; no evidence of lead-time drift. Recent realized demands (Periods 1\u20135) average 702.2 units/period (sample: [744,704,735,705,623]) so I use those to set demand over review+lead. With L=1 default, mu_hat = (1+L)*mean = 2*702.2 = 1404.4. Sample std = 42.67; sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std = 1.4142*42.67 = 60.36. Current on-hand=96 and in-transit=708 => pipeline=804. These parameters produce a base-stock ~1430 and a target replenishment \u22481430\u2212804\u2248626 (cap >> that), balancing service (q=profit/(profit+holding)=2/3 -> z\u22480.431) against holding cost given confirmed LT=1 and recent demand levels.

Carry-over insight: Lead time regime confirmed = 1 period (evidence: arrivals in Periods 2\u20135 correspond to orders from Periods 1\u20134; observed LT=1).

Period 7 (2019-06-10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Promised lead time = 1 and concluded periods 2\u20136 show arrivals consistent with LT=1; use default LT=1. Historical demand samples (given) have mean=631.2 and std\u2248161.87. Using default aggregation across review+lead (1+L=2) gives mu_hat=2\xd7631.2=1262.4 and sigma_hat=\u221a2\xd7161.87\u2248229.0. Current inventory (on-hand 137 + in-transit 609 = 746) is below the computed base_stock, so parameters raise target stock to improve service while accounting for observed demand volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1138.00

Period 8 (2019-06-24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24 (Period 8). Historical concluded periods 1\u20137 show consistent arrivals with promised LT=1 (orders on Periods 1\u20136 arrived after 1 period). On-hand=118, in-transit=663. I use L=promised (1) since multiple consecutive concluded periods confirm LT=1. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using defaults: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(demand of concluded periods 1\u20137) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(demand of concluded periods 1\u20137). Demand mean over periods 1\u20137 = 686.5714286 \u2192 mu_hat = 1373.142857. Demand population std = 44.9438 \u2192 sigma_hat = 63.5785. These parameters keep the OR backend anchored to recent realized demand and the stable LT regime, balancing service level (via base-stock) against holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime confirmed = 1 period (evidence: arrivals in Periods 2\u20137 correspond to orders from Periods 1\u20136; observed LT=1).

Period 9 (2019-07-08) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-08 (Period 9). Lead time has been consistently 1 in concluded history (Periods 2\u20138 arrivals), so keep L=1. Recent demand has stepped down from earlier volatility to ~600s over the last 5 periods (Periods 4\u20138: demands 705,623,667,628,606); I use this recent regime to set forecast and volatility. On-hand=175 + in-transit=619 => pipeline=794; with (1+L)-horizon demand forecast ~1291.6 this signals we may be short over the review+lead period absent additional arrivals, so we use recent-based mu_hat and sigma_hat to keep service while limiting excess stock given holding cost=$1 and profit=$2.

Period 10 (2019-07-22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-07-22. On-hand=129, in-transit=522. Historical concluded demand (Periods 1\u20139) average = 675.222 units/period; demand variance stable with no recent changepoint. All concluded arrivals through Period 9 show lead time = 1 (orders on Periods 1\u20138 arrived in Periods 2\u20139). Promised LT=1 is supported by evidence, so use L=default (1). Use default mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) to reflect the two-period review+lead demand (conservative given stable demand). Use default sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples) to capture observed variability. These parameters give the OR backend the appropriate base-stock and cap balancing profit ($2) vs holding ($1) by using the empirical mean and volatility over the full recent history.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime confirmed = 1 period (evidence: orders on Periods 1\u20138 arrived in Periods 2\u20139).

Mean=631.2; use (1+L)*mean to cover review+lead demand and sqrt(1+L)*sample_std for volatility. This raises mu_hat to 1262.4 (covers two-period demand) and sigma_hat to 255.9, which the OR backend will convert to a base-stock and capped order to balance the $2 profit vs $1 holding cost.

Period 12 (2019-08-19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Promised lead time has strong, consistent evidence of 1 period (arrivals in Periods 2\u201311 match orders from Periods 1\u201310 with LT=1). Use L=1. Demand samples (486,574,559,947,590) give mean=631.2; using default (1+L) scaling yields mu_hat=1262.4. Sample std \u2248161.87, scaled by sqrt(1+L) gives sigma_hat\u2248228.88. These defaults keep the OR backend's base-stock tied to observed demand and the stable LT, providing service while limiting holding given holding cost=$1 vs profit=$2 (q=0.667). Current on-hand 294 + in-transit 517 gives significant pipeline; parameters reflect observed demand variability without overreacting to recent ordering fluctuations.

Period 13 (2019-09-02) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-09-02. On-hand=288, in-transit=547. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent 1-period realized lead time across periods 2\u201312, so use promised lead time. I use all available demand history (periods 1\u201312) to estimate demand: mean demand = 641.0 units/period; with L=1 the review+lead demand forecast mu_hat = (1+L)*mean = 1282.0. Sample std dev across the 12 period demands is \u224875.63; sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std \u2248 107.0. These parameters keep the OR engine anchored to full-sample demand evidence while the explicit L=1 keeps pipeline timing accurate given consistent arrivals; this balances service (profit $2 vs holding $1) with inventory cost via the backend's target z* and cap.

Period 15 decision on 2019-09-30. History shows consistent observed lead time = 1 (arrivals in concluded Periods 2\u201314 match orders from Periods 1\u201313); use promised/default L=1. Current inventory: on-hand=163, in-transit=515 (pipeline=678). Demand history (provided) = [486,574,559,947,590]; no recent changepoint detected. Use default estimators: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) = 2*631.2 = 1262.4 to cover review+lead demand; sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples) \u2248 1.4142*181.0 = 256.0 to reflect observed volatility. These settings keep the OR engine's base-stock responsive to the observed mean and variance while relying on the confirmed LT=1 so the capped order constraint will limit oversized orders given current large pipeline.

No recent evidence of a regime shift in demand. Using default methods: L = promised lead time = 1. mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) = 2 * 631.2 = 1262.4. sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples) = sqrt(2) * 161.87 \u2248 228.9. These settings keep the OR backend's base-stock anchored to long-run sample mean while accounting for one-period lead time and observed volatility, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

Period 17 (2019-10-28) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 17). Historical concluded arrivals show a stable lead-time=1 across many periods (Periods 2\u201316); no evidence of recent LT drift or lost shipments. Demand history shows no clear changepoint vs. older samples, so use full-sample defaults. Set L to promised=1. Use default mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples) based on provided demand samples [486,574,559,947,590] (mean=631.2, std\u2248181.0) so mu_hat=1262.4 and sigma_hat\u2248255.9.

Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using defaults: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all 17 demands) to cover review+lead period; sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all 17 demands) to reflect demand variability over the review+lead window. This balances service (captures observed demand mean) vs holding cost (uses historical variability rather than extra safety).

Period 19 (2019-11-25) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 19). Historical concluded periods 2\u201318 consistently show observed lead time = 1; current inventory: on-hand=337, in-transit=508. Demand history (provided seed) has mean 631.2 and sample std 180.28. I use L=default (promised lead time=1) because multiple concluded periods confirm LT=1 with no missed arrivals. I set mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_all = 2*631.2 = 1262.4 to cover review+lead demand; sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std_all = sqrt(2)*180.28 = 254.8 to capture combined-period volatility. These choices give the OR backend an up-to-date forecast and safety buffer consistent with observed variability and the 1-period lead time, balancing service (profit $2 vs holding $1) while avoiding excessive holding given substantial pipeline (508 units).

Recent demand sample set mean = 631.2 (samples: 486,574,559,947,590). I use default methods: L=promised (1) given consistent evidence; mu_hat = (1+L)*mean = 2*631.2 = 1262.4 to cover review+lead demand; sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std = sqrt(2)*181.0 \u2248 256.0 to capture demand variability.
