No evidence yet of a new regime. c) Lead time: supplier promised LT=1 but no concluded periods with arrivals to confirm actual LT; treat LT as 1 per playbook but do not expect any arrivals this period. d) Inventory & pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=0, so Period 1 demand cannot be satisfied now. e) Order logic: to maximize profit*units - holding*ending_inventory, serve expected next-period demand while avoiding excess holding cost (holding = $1/unit/period is high relative to profit $2). I will order ~ expected demand for the next period \u2248 631 units (rounded to 631). This balances capturing profitable sales next period while limiting holding cost if demand is lower.",
