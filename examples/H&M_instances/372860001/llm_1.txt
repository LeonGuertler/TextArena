  "rationale": "Date/context: Period 1 (2019-03-18), no special holiday influence. Historical demand prior to observations (SKU 372860001): samples [486, 574, 559, 947, 590] \u2192 mean \u2248 631 units/14-day period; variance elevated due to 947 outlier. Lead time: supplier promised LT=1 but no concluded periods exist to confirm actual LT; treat LT as 1 for planning but remain cautious. Inventory/pipeline: on-hand 0, in-transit 0; any order placed this period will NOT arrive for Period 1 demand (sequencing). Forecast: use prior mean \u2248631 for next period demand; given high holding cost ($1/unit/period) relative to profit ($2/unit sold), be conservative to avoid excess ending inventory while maintaining service level. Order logic: place enough to cover one expected period demand (~631) for Period 2 while avoiding significant overstock. Therefore order 630 units (rounded slightly down from mean).",
