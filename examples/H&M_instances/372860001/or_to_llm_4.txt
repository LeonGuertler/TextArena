  Mean: 631.2, Count: 5
Promised lead time (used by OR, shown to LLM): 1 periods (1 period = 14 days)
Note: OR uses promised lead time for recommendations. Actual lead times in CSV may differ.
      LLM must infer actual lead time from arrivals and adjust OR recommendations accordingly.

{
  "rationale": "Date 2019-03-18: no special seasonal factors detected for this SKU. Historical sample mean demand \u2248631 units (samples: 486,574,559,947,590) with sample SD \u2248181. OR baseline (capped) recommends 929, but its base_stock using estimated mean and service z* (profit/(profit+holding)=2/3 \u2192 z\u22480.43) yields \u2248631 + 0.43\xb7181 \u2248 709. On-hand and in-transit are 0 and there is no concluded history to contradict the supplier's promised LT=1, so assume LT=1 for planning. Given moderate holding cost (holding=$1 vs profit=$2) I reduce OR's higher recommendation to the statistically supported base_stock to balance service level and holding cost. Final order targets base_stock to cover expected period demand plus safety stock: 709 units.",
