Using initial samples from train.csv: /Users/tianyipeng/Documents/Operations_Research_Code/25-11-supply-chain-agent/OR_Agent/examples/H&M_instances/372860001/train.csv
  Samples: [486, 574, 559, 947, 590]
  Mean: 631.2, Count: 5
Promised lead time (used by OR, shown to LLM): 1 periods (1 period = 14 days)
Note: OR uses promised lead time for recommendations. Actual lead times in CSV may differ.
      LLM must infer actual lead time from arrivals and adjust OR recommendations accordingly.

{
  "rationale": "Date 2019-03-18 \u2014 no special seasonal event for basic socks. Historical sample: mean demand \u2248631 units, sample SD \u2248181. OR capped recommendation = 929 (starts from its base-stock). Promised lead time = 1 (no concluded periods to contradict). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so all future service depends on this order. Given profit=$2 and holding=$1 (q\u22480.667), the OR recommendation is conservative/high relative to observed mean; high holding cost argues against matching 929. I scale OR down toward the observed demand mean while retaining a safety buffer for variability and LT=1. Final order = 700 units balances service-level (targets slightly above mean) against holding cost risk.",
