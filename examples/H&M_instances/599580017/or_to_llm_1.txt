OR recommendation: 523 units (caps applied by OR baseline) \u2014 I treat this as a high-side starting point. Decision: be conservative versus OR because on-hand=0, in-transit=0, holding cost is high ($1/unit/period) relative to profit ($2), and LT unconfirmed. I order slightly above the historical mean to cover early-season uplift but avoid large holding cost if demand does not rise.

Evidence: Period 1 concluded demand=671 (we had zero on-hand so sold=0), which is far above the historical mean (330) and implies demand has jumped this horizon. Lead time: supplier promised LT=1; pipeline=360 (the order placed in P1 is still in-transit) and we have no concluded late-arrival evidence yet, so assume LT=1 for planning. OR recommendation: OR (which didn't see P1 demand) recommends 520 units. Interpretation: OR's number is a sensible base_stock target but is blind to the P1 spike; with pipeline=360 we would still stockout next period if we only ordered OR's net amount. Adjustment: update demand estimate by including P1=671 (new mean \u2248387) and keep conservative safety stock given uncertainty.

On-hand=0 and in-transit=639 (this in-transit was ordered in Period3 and, given observed LT=1 historically, is expected to arrive before Period4 demand but is not visible at decision time). OR recommended 505 (capped baseline using promised LT and historical demand). I treat OR as a starting point but adjust: OR's 505 would likely understock given the recent demand regime (~770 units per period recently). Because orders placed now arrive next period (so cannot help Period4) I must plan for Period5 demand. If high demand persists (~772 recent average), we should target about that level arriving next period. Therefore I order 772 units to rebuild availability for the next period while accepting holding cost risk if demand softens.
