Use this as prior for per-period demand. c) Lead time / missing orders: supplier-promised lead time = 1 period. No prior arrivals recorded yet (on-hand=0, in-transit=0) so actual lead time not yet verifiable; treat lead time as 1 for planning but monitor arrivals to detect deviations. d) Inventory & pipeline: on-hand 0, in-transit 0. With L=1 and no pipeline, we should cover (L+1)=2 periods of demand to avoid stockouts when next arrival occurs. e) Final order logic: forecast = 330 units/period (historical mean). Order = forecast * (L+1) = 330 * 2 = 660 units. This balances service against holding cost given early-season uplift; will reassess when Period 1 conclude arrival/demand data appear.",
