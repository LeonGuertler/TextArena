History shows an order placed in Period 1 is still listed as in-transit (310) and Period 1 concluded with arrived=0, so no concluded evidence of LT>1 or lost order; assume LT=1 but remain cautious. d) Inventory & pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=310 (likely to arrive before demand this period per promised LT=1).

Historical demand evidence: Period1 demand=671, Period2 demand=844 (vs unified prior mean ~330), so demand appears to have shifted up. Lead time vs missing orders: Concluded Period2 shows the Period1 order (310) arrived in Period2 (ordered on Period1, lead_time=1). Thus supplier LT=1 (use only concluded arrivals to infer). Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0; in-transit=140 (this is the order placed in Period2) \u2014 that shipment will arrive after I make the Period3 decision but before Period3 demand, so only 140 units will be available to meet Period3 demand. Orders placed now (Period3) will arrive in Period4 and will NOT affect Period3 demand.
