{
  "rationale": "Date/context: Period 1 (2019-04-01). Swimwear season approaching (spring \u2192 rising demand into summer). Demand regime: historical unified samples = [159,281,388,354,468] show an upward pattern; recent samples higher, so expect elevated demand next period. Lead time & pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=0, no concluded arrivals to infer deviations from promised LT=1; assume supplier LT=1 for ordering (orders placed now arrive next period). Inventory strategy: holding cost is high (Holding=$1 vs Profit=$2), so avoid large multi-period overstock; order roughly one-period expected demand plus modest safety. Forecast & order logic: target ~350 units for Period 2 demand (mid/upper range of historical samples) to capture demand ramp while limiting holding exposure. Action: place order for 350 units (will arrive in Period 2).",
