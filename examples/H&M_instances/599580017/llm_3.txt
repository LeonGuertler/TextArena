Supplier promised LT=1 but arrival missing for one concluded period; this is insufficient evidence to declare increased LT or lost order. In-transit=360 likely still expected to arrive but timing uncertain. d) Inventory & pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=360. If those 360 arrive before demand this period they will cover at least part of demand; any new order placed now will not arrive before demand for Period 2 (orders arrive after decision). e) Final order logic: Because holding cost ($1) is high relative to profit ($2), avoid large speculative orders. Given elevated demand signal but uncertain persistence and 360 units already in pipeline, place a modest replenishment to top up for future periods without creating high holding cost.
