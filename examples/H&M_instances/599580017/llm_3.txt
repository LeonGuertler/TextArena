Period 1 (2019-04-01) VM Action:
============================================================
{
  "rationale": "a) Date/news: Period start 2019-04-01 (early-April). Swimwear is seasonal with demand ramping into spring/summer in Northern Hemisphere, so expect rising demand vs. baseline. b) Demand regime: historical unified samples = [159,281,388,354,468], mean=330 units/period. Recent two-sample mean (Periods with 354,468) = 411 indicating an upward shift. Use a modest uplift vs. long-run mean to reflect seasonality. c) Lead time vs missing orders: Supplier promised LT=1, but no concluded periods show arrivals yet, so LT=1 is unverified. Cannot count any arrivals for Period 1 decision. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no arrivals will occur before Period 1 demand since any LT=1 arrivals would be from prior orders (none). Orders placed now will arrive in Period 2. e) Final order logic: Forecast Period 2 demand ~330\u2013410; balance profit ($2) vs high holding cost ($1/period) by targeting expected demand rather than a large safety stock. Place order to cover ~mean demand with modest season uplift. Order 330 units for arrival in Period 2.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Demand shows upward shift: recent two samples (354 on ? , 468 on ?) average 411 > historical mean 330, indicating seasonal ramp into spring; treat as tentative sustained increase. Lead time: promised LT=1 but unverified\u2014no concluded arrivals yet.",
