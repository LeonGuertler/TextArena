Period 1 (2019-04-01) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019-04-01). On-hand=0, in-transit=0; no concluded arrivals in history to infer LT changes. Historical demand samples: [159,281,388,354,468] (mean=330, sample std\u2248116.86). Promised LT=1 used (no evidence of delays). Use default aggregation over all samples so base-stock reflects full-sample mean and variability; this balances service (capturing an observed uptick in recent points) against holding cost given profit=2, holding=1.

Carry-over insight: Recent uptick in demand: last 3 periods avg=403.3 vs overall mean=330 \u2014 monitor for sustained regime shift.

Period 2 (2019-04-15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 decision (2019-04-15). History: recent large demand spike (Period1 demand=671) added to prior series [159,281,388,354,468], supporting a persistent upward shift. Promised LT=1 and there is 523 in-transit but no concluded arrivals yet; this is a single missed arrival observation so keep L at promised=1. I treat a new higher-demand regime: use recent_N for demand with N=3 (most recent three demands 354,468,671) to reflect the uptick and raise service level while limiting holding cost. Calculations: L=1 so review+lead multiplier=(1+L)=2. recent mean of last 3 = 497.6667 -> mu_hat = 2 * 497.6667 = 995.3334. Sample std of last 3 = 160.5579 -> sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*160.5579 = 227.1100. These parameters raise base-stock to meet higher demand while using the OR engine's cap to limit oversized orders given the single outstanding in-transit shipment.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shifted up: recent 3-period avg (354,468,671)=497.7 vs prior overall mean\u2248330; treat as sustained until contradicted.

Period 3 (2019-04-29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent history shows an upward demand regime (carry-over insight from Periods 1\u20132). Promised lead time observed =1 in concluded history (Period 2 arrival from Period 1), so keep L=1 (default). For demand I use recent_N=3 to capture the regime shift detected earlier (most recent 3-sample mean =403.333), and scale by (1+L) to cover review+lead period: mu_hat = 2 * 403.333 = 806.666. Volatility is based on the same recent 3 samples (std \u224858.56) scaled by sqrt(1+L): sigma_hat = sqrt(2)*58.56 \u224882.82. These parameters raise the base-stock to reflect the sustained higher demand while keeping sigma elevated to allow safety stock for variability and potential late arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand uptick: recent 3-period mean=403.33 vs prior overall mean\u2248330 (evidence from recent periods); treat as new regime until contradicted.

Period 4 (2019-05-13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13 (Period 4). History shows two observed arrivals with lead_time=1 (Period2 and Period3 concluded arrivals), and pipeline=866 units from order in Period3 expected to arrive with LT=1 after this decision. Demand has clearly shifted up: recent 3-period demands = [671,844,800] (mean=771.6667) >> earlier low samples. I set L to the promised/observed lead time (1). I use recent_N=3 for demand because a sustained high-demand regime is evident (changepoint at start of these three high periods); mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_recent to capture review+lead demand; sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std_recent to reflect observed volatility in the new regime. These parameters increase target base-stock to protect service level given the higher realized demand and the one-period lead time while keeping holding cost in mind.

Period 5 (2019-05-27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Promised LT=1 and concluded periods 2\u20134 show arrivals with lead_time=1 consistently \u2192 use observed average LT=1. Demand shows a clear sustained uptick: recent 3 concluded demands = [844,800,787], recent-3 mean=810.33 vs earlier sample mean\u2248330 (prior history [159,281,388,354,468]). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the new higher-demand regime. This raises the base-stock to protect service while sigma_hat accounts for observed variability; cap will still limit extreme orders.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand uplift: recent 3-period mean=810.33 vs prior overall mean\u2248330 (evidence: Periods with demands 844,800,787); treat as new higher-demand regime until contradicted.

Period 6 (2019-06-10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 decision on 2019-06-10: history shows three consecutive high-demand periods (Periods 3-5 demands = 800, 787, 855) and all observed arrivals had lead time=1. On-hand=0, in-transit=827 (order placed in Period 5). I treat the recent high-demand regime as sustained and base demand estimates on the last 3 periods. L is set to the average observed lead time (1). mu_hat uses recent_N (last 3) to capture the raised mean: (1+L)*mean(800,787,855)=2*814=1628. sigma_hat uses recent_N (last 3) with population std scaled by sqrt(1+L): std_population(800,787,855)=29.52 \u2192 sigma_hat=29.52*sqrt(2)=41.77. These parameters raise base-stock to satisfy service under the higher recent demand while recognizing holding cost by not expanding beyond the recent-demand-driven forecast.

Carry-over insight: Sustained higher-demand regime: recent 3 periods (Periods 3-5) demands = [800,787,855], mean=814 \u2192 use higher demand regime until contradicted.

Period 7 (2019-06-24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24 (Period 7). History shows consistent observed lead time = 1 (every concluded arrival was ordered one period earlier). Recent demand has shifted sharply higher: periods 3\u20136 demands = [800,787,855,819], mean=815.25, std\u224829.58. On-hand=8, in-transit=823 (pipeline large). To protect service in this sustained high-demand regime, set lead time to the observed average (1) and base-stock using the recent high-demand regime (N=4). mu_hat = (1+L)*recent_mean -> 2*815.25 = 1630.5. sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*recent_std -> sqrt(2)*29.58 \u2248 41.85. These parameters raise target inventory to match the new demand level while sigma captures the observed variability; large pipeline reduces immediate ordering pressure.

Carry-over insight: Sustained higher-demand regime: Periods 3\u20136 demands = [800,787,855,819], mean=815.25, std\u224829.58; use higher-demand regime until contradicted.

Period 8 (2019-07-08) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-08 (Period 8). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime: Periods 3\u20136 demands = [800,787,855,819], mean=815.25, std\u224829.58; Period 7 had a one-off large demand (1363) but it appears to be an outlier vs. the established higher regime. On-hand=0, in-transit=818 (this is the order placed in Period 7; arrivals from recent orders are observed only from concluded periods). Observed lead times in concluded history are consistently 1 period. To protect service under the higher-demand regime while avoiding overreaction to the single extreme spike in Period 7, set L to the observed promised lead time (1), use a recent_N demand estimate based on the 4-period higher-demand regime (N=4) for mu_hat, and compute sigma_hat from the same 4 samples. This raises the base-stock to meet elevated mean demand while sigma is modest (reflecting low variability in the 4-period regime), limiting excessive holding costs.

Period 9 (2019-07-22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-22 (Period 9). Recent history shows a clear sustained uplift with large spikes: recent demands (Periods 5\u20138) = [855, 819, 1363, 1052], mean=1022.25 and elevated variance. All concluded periods show observed lead times =1 (orders placed on Period N arrived on Period N+1). On-hand=0, in-transit=1261 (pipeline). To protect service vs. recent high/volatile demand I set lead time L=1 (average observed), and use a recent-N demand estimate (N=4, last 4 periods) so mu_hat reflects the new higher regime: mu_hat=(1+L)*mean_recent =2*1022.25=2044.5. Volatility is scaled from the same recent sample: std_recent \u2248249.26, sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std_recent \u22481.4142*249.26=352.5. These parameters raise base-stock to meet the higher mean and account for the recent spike-driven variance while the OR backend will still cap order size via its cap formula. 

Carry-over insight: Sustained higher-demand regime: Periods 5\u20138 demands = [855,819,1363,1052], recent mean=1022.25, recent std\u2248249.3; use higher-demand regime until contradicted.

Period 10 (2019-08-05) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 10). History shows a clear sustained uplift starting around Period 5: recent demands = [855,819,1363,1052,1019] (Periods 5\u20139). All observed arrivals in concluded periods indicate lead time=1 consistently. I therefore keep L at the promised lead time=1. To capture the new higher-demand regime I use recent_N for demand (N=5, Periods 5\u20139) giving a recent mean of 1021.6 units; mu_hat = (1+L)*mean = 2*1021.6 = 2043.2. Volatility is estimated from the same recent window: sample std \u2248215.78; sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std = 1.4142*215.78 \u2248305.24. These settings raise the base-stock to cover the uplifted mean demand over the review+lead horizon while reflecting observed variability; keeping L=1 is supported by all concluded-period lead-time observations.

Carry-over insight: Sustained higher-demand regime starting ~Period 5: Periods 5\u20139 mean=1021.6, std\u2248215.8; use higher-demand regime until contradicted.

Period 11 (2019-08-19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19 (Period 11). History shows a sustained higher-demand regime beginning ~Period 5: Periods 5\u20139 demands = [855,819,1363,1052,1019], mean=1021.6, std\u2248215.8. All concluded arrivals in history show observed lead time = 1 (orders arriving one period after order) so use promised LT=1. Per policy, set demand forecast across review+lead (1+L) using the recent regime (N=5) to capture the sustained uplift; choose N=5 because regime length=5 and rule N = max(min(regime_length,20),3). For volatility use same recent window to reflect current dispersion. These parameters raise base-stock to serve the higher demand while sigma increases safety stock to cover observed variability; keeping L=1 avoids overreacting to transient arrival issues (none observed).

Carry-over insight: Sustained higher-demand regime starting ~Period 5: Periods 5\u20139 mean=1021.6, std\u2248215.8; use higher-demand regime until contradicted.

Period 12 (2019-09-02) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 12). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime since ~Period 2\u20139 with volatile peaks and some low periods (Periods 10\u201311 small). All concluded arrivals in history show observed lead times = 1 (every concluded arrival cites ordered on prior period, lead_time=1). I therefore use L=promised (1). To capture the sustained elevated demand I use the full historical sample (Periods 1\u201311) to set demand moments: mean(demand)=801.0909 \u2192 mu_hat=(1+L)*mean=1602.1818. Sample std \u2248308.02; sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std \u2248435.78. These settings reflect the empirically observed high mean and high volatility so the OR backend raises the base-stock (to meet service) while sigma inflates safety stock for the observed demand swings; keeping L=1 matches consistent observed lead times.

Period 13 (2019-09-16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-09-16. On-hand=1625, in-transit=0. Historical arrivals consistently showed lead_time=1 in concluded periods (Period2\u201312 all arrivals tied to orders placed one period earlier), so use promised LT=1. Recent demand has fallen sharply since Period 9: Periods 10\u201312 demands = [308,294,143], recent 3-period mean=248.33 vs prior higher-demand regime mean\u22481021.6; this is a clear changepoint. To react quickly, I use a 3-period recent window for demand. Set L=default (promised=1). Use mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last 3 demands) to size stock for the shorter recent regime and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(last 3) to reflect observed lower-volatility but still capture variability. These parameters reduce overstock risk given the recent demand drop while preserving service through current on-hand coverage.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime reversed down starting Period 10: Periods 10\u201312 demands = [308,294,143], mean=248.33 (use recent low-demand regime until contradicted).

Period 14 (2019-09-30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Promised LT historically observed =1 in all concluded periods \u2192 keep L=1. Recent demand regime reversed down starting Period 10: last 4 concluded demands (Periods 10\u201313) = [308,294,143,65], mean=202.5, volatility std\u2248102.41. Use recent_N=4 to capture the low-demand regime when computing demand over review+lead (1+L=2). This reduces target base-stock and avoids excess holding given on-hand=1560 and zero in-transit. Parameters chosen: L=default(1); mu_hat = (1+L)*recent_mean = 405.0; sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*recent_std \u2248 144.84. These lower-demand estimates align service level to current low-demand regime and limit holding cost drag on the large on-hand position.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-14 (Period 15). On-hand=1460, in-transit=0. History shows consistent promised lead time of 1 (all concluded arrivals with nonzero qty had lead_time=1). Recent demand has reverted down starting ~Period 10: periods 10\u201314 demands = [308,294,143,65,100], mean=182.0, std\u2248100.45. I therefore use the promised LT=1 and set demand forecast to the recent low-demand regime (last N=5 periods) to avoid overstocking. mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_recent = 2*182.0 = 364.0. sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std_recent = sqrt(2)*100.45 \u2248 142.1. These parameters reduce target base-stock to match the lower recent demand while preserving some safety stock for variability and uncertain arrivals.

Period 16 (2019-10-28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 16). On-hand=1367, in-transit=0; no arrivals expected from recent orders (Period 15 ordered=0). Historical concluded lead-times are consistently 1 period (many observations of arrived units ordered previous period with LT=1). Demand has been in a lower regime since ~Period 10: last 6 demands = [308,294,143,65,100,93], mean=167.17, std\u2248106.74. I set L to the promised lead time=1 (no evidence of persistent LT drift). I use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat to capture the low-demand regime: mu_hat=(1+L)*mean_recent =2*167.17=334.33. I use recent_N (N=6) for sigma_hat: sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std_recent =\u221a2*106.74\u2248151.0. These parameters lower the target base-stock to reflect the sustained drop in demand, avoiding excess holding cost given currently high on-hand inventory.

Period 17 (2019-11-11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 17). History shows lead times historically =1 (many concluded periods with arrived units matching orders placed previous period). Demand has been in a sustained low-demand regime since ~Period 10 (periods 10\u201316 demands = [308,294,143,65,100,93,70], recent mean \u2248153.29, std \u224896.42). I set L to the promised lead time (1) because concluded-period evidence consistently shows LT=1. For demand I use recent_N over the detected low-demand regime (N=7, Periods 10\u201316) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_recent to reflect the review+lead demand under the current regime, and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std_recent to capture current lower volatility. These parameters reduce ordering toward the new low-demand regime (protect service level given LT=1) and avoid excess holding given high on-hand inventory.

For demand I use recent_N over the last 9 periods (regime length=9) to capture the sustained low-demand regime: mu_hat=(1+L)*mean=2*144.0=288.0. sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std = sqrt(2)*95.73 \u2248135.4.

I use L=1 (promised) and set demand forecast over review+lead (1+L=2) using the recent low-demand regime (N=10 most recent periods) to reflect the persistent drop and avoid overstock. sigma_hat uses the same recent window scaled by sqrt(1+L) to capture reduced volatility. These choices reduce target base-stock to match current low demand and lower holding costs while maintaining service for the observed regime.
