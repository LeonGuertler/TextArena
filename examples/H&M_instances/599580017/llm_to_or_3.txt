Period 1 (2019-04-01) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019-04-01). No on-hand or in-transit inventory; past 5 demands = [159,281,388,354,468], mean=330, demand shows rising variability but no clear recent changepoint with only 5 samples. Promised LT=1 and no concluded arrivals to suggest deviation, so use promised lead time. Use default (all-sample) demand stats scaled by (1+L) to let the OR engine compute base-stock given profit $2 vs holding $1 (service target ~66.7%). This keeps safety stock moderate while avoiding excess holding from an overestimated LT or recent spike not yet confirmed.

Period 2 (2019-04-15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15 (Period 2). Promised lead time = 1. History: Period 1 concluded: ordered=523 arrived=0 \u2014 arrival missing but per sequencing we cannot treat this as confirmed LT>1 (no concluded arrival with explicit lead-time). Demand history samples = [159,281,388,354,468], mean=330, sample std \u2248104.54. I use default (promised) lead time L=1 because we lack concluded arrivals to prove longer LT. mu_hat = (1+L)*mean = 2*330 = 660 to cover review+lead demand. sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std = sqrt(2)*104.54 \u2248 147.86 to reflect demand variability over review+lead. These parameters keep service level driven by profit/(profit+holding)=2/(2+1)=0.666.. while not inflating safety stock for an unconfirmed shipment loss; if future concluded periods show late/missing arrivals, escalate L and safety stock.

Period 3 (2019-04-29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 decision (2019-04-29): on-hand=0, in-transit=357 (ordered in Period 2). History shows one concluded observed lead time: Period 2 arrival of the Period 1 order with lead_time=1. Demand history (samples=[159,281,388,354,468]) has mean=330 units. Promised LT=1 and observed arrivals support LT=1 this period. I use L=1 (calculated average of observed lead times). With L=1 I set mu_hat using the default (1+L)*mean = 2*330 = 660 to cover review+lead period demand. sigma_hat uses default sqrt(1+L)*std(samples); sample std \u2248116.86, so sigma_hat \u2248165.3. These settings keep the OR engine's base-stock aligned to recent demand scale while the cap will limit orders; using observed LT avoids overreacting to the current in-transit quantity which will arrive after decision sequencing.

Carry-over insight: Lead time observed = 1 period (Period 2 concluded: 523 arrived from order placed in Period 1).

Period 4 (2019-05-13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-05-13 (Period 4). History shows two observed lead times =1 (orders placed Period1->arrived Period2; Period2->Period3), so no evidence of LT drift. Recent demand in concluded periods is much higher than the older samples (Period1-3 demands: 671, 844, 800) \u2014 clear upward regime versus the prior low-sample series. I set L to the promised/default (1). I use a recent_N demand estimate to capture the new high-demand regime: N=3 (the three most recent concluded demands) -> mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last3) to target service for the review+lead period. For volatility I use recent_N with the same N to reflect current demand variability: sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(last3). These parameters raise the base-stock to meet the sustained higher demand while L=1 keeps lead-time uncertainty low based on observed arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift upward: Periods 1-3 concluded demands = 671, 844, 800; recent mean = 771.67 over last 3 periods; use recent regime for forecasting.

Period 5 (2019-05-27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
History shows consistent 1-period arrivals in concluded periods (orders placed in P1->arrived P2, P2->P3, P3->P4). Demand has shifted up recently: last 3 concluded demands = [844, 800, 787] (mean=810.33), so use a recent-3 regime for forecasting. Set L based on observed lead times (average=1). mu_hat is (1+L)*recent_mean to cover review+lead; sigma_hat uses sqrt(1+L)*std of the same recent window to reflect current volatility. These choices raise safety stock to cover the sustained higher demand while respecting the known 1-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Lead time stable at 1 period (observed P2,P3,P4 arrivals from prior-period orders); Demand regime elevated \u2014 recent 3-period mean=810.33 (periods with demands 844,800,787).

Period 6 (2019-06-10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10 (Period 6). History shows consistent observed lead times = 1 (Periods 2-5 arrivals each from prior-period orders) and a clear elevated demand regime in the most recent 3 periods (Period 3-5 demands = 800, 787, 855). On-hand=53, in-transit=731 (pipeline large). Set L to observed-average lead time=1. Use recent_N=3 for demand forecast to capture the elevated regime: recent mean = 814.0 \u2192 mu_hat = (1+L)*814.0 = 1628.0. Use recent_N=3 for volatility: sample std of [800,787,855] \u2248 36.11, scaled by sqrt(1+L)=\u221a2 gives sigma_hat \u2248 51.05. These parameters raise the base-stock to match the higher recent demand while preserving cap constraints; they rely on stable LT=1 and recent demand evidence.

Period 7 (2019-06-24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24 (Period 7). History shows stable promised lead time = 1 and confirmed arrivals with LT=1 in multiple concluded periods (Periods 2\u20136). Recent demand regime is elevated: last 3 concluded demands = [787, 855, 819], mean = 820.33, std (population) = 27.78. On-hand = 0, in-transit = 866 (order placed in Period 6) \u2014 arrival will be observed only after next decision per sequencing. I therefore set L to the promised/stable value 1. For demand over the review+lead window (1+L=2 periods) I use a recent_N = 3 regime to capture the elevated demand mean; mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_recent = 2 * 820.3333 = 1640.6667. For volatility I use recent_N = 3: sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std_recent = sqrt(2) * 27.7778 = 39.3104. These parameters raise the base-stock to reflect the higher recent demand while keeping LT=1 (observed stable), balancing service vs holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

Carry-over insight: Lead time stable at 1 period (Periods 2\u20136 arrivals confirmed); Recent demand regime elevated \u2014 last 3 demands mean=820.33, std=27.78 (Periods 4\u20136).

Period 8 (2019-07-08) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-08 (Period 8). Historical arrivals show a stable observed lead time of 1 period (all concluded arrivals were 1 period). Demand experienced an elevated regime prior to Period 7 spike: periods 4\u20136 demands = [787,855,819], mean=820.33, sd\u224834.02. Period 7 demand=1363 is a clear outlier/spike; I treat it as an isolated event and base forecast on the recent elevated regime (periods 4\u20136). Therefore set L=1 (observed), use recent_N=3 for demand to capture the elevated regime (mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_recent), and sigma_hat based on the same recent window scaled by sqrt(1+L). This raises target base-stock to cover the higher steady demand while avoiding overreaction to the single large spike.

Period 9 (2019-07-22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-22 (Period 9). History shows a stable promised lead time of 1 with all concluded arrivals from Periods 2\u20138 matching prior-period orders. Current inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=1414 (order placed in Period 8). Recent demand has jumped (Periods 6-8 demands = 819, 1363, 1052) indicating a new high regime; use a recent-3 estimate to capture this. I set L=1 (promised/stable), mu_hat using recent 3-period mean for (1+L)\xd7mean = 2\xd71078.0 = 2156.0, and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(recent 3) to reflect elevated volatility (std(recent 3)=222.86 \u2192 sigma_hat\u2248315.22). These parameters raise target base-stock to meet the higher demand while keeping cap logic in the OR engine to limit extreme replenishment.

Carry-over insight: Lead time stable at 1 period (observed arrivals in Periods 2\u20138). Demand regime elevated: recent 3-period mean demand=1078.0, std\u2248222.9 (Periods 6\u20138).

Period 10 (2019-08-05) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 10). Historical concluded arrivals show a stable 1-period lead time (every concluded period P2\u2013P9 shows arrivals from prior-period orders). Recent demand has jumped; last 3 concluded demands (Periods 7\u20139 = 1363, 1052, 1019) show an elevated regime. I set L to the promised/stable value 1. I use recent_N=3 for mu_hat to capture the current elevated mean and recent_N=3 for sigma_hat to capture current volatility; this raises both mean demand and safety stock to avoid stockouts given the recent spike. Parameters: L=1 -> mu_hat=(1+L)*mean_last3 = 2*1144.6667 = 2289.3334; sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std_last3 = sqrt(2)*189.789 = 268.606. These increase target base-stock to prioritize service vs holding given profit/holding (q=2/(2+1)=0.666...).

Carry-over insight: Lead time stable at 1 period (observed arrivals P2\u2013P9); Demand regime elevated \u2014 last 3 demands (Periods 7\u20139) mean=1144.67, std\u2248189.79.

Period 11 (2019-08-19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19 (Period 11). Lead time has been observed stable at 1 in concluded history (arrivals from Periods 2\u201310 confirm LT=1). On-hand=996, in-transit=1101 (pipeline already substantial). Recent demand regime remains elevated \u2014 use the last strong-demand regime (Periods 7\u20139) rather than the anomalous low in Period 10. I set L to the promised/default (1). I set mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to capture the elevated regime (mean of Periods 7\u20139 = 1144.67 \u2192 mu_hat=(1+L)*mean = 2*1144.67 = 2289.33). I set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=3) to reflect observed variability in that regime (std of Periods 7\u20139 \u2248189.79; sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std \u2248 268.56). These parameters raise the base-stock to protect service against the high recent demand while the cap in the OR engine will limit overly large shipments given existing pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Lead time stable at 1 period (arrivals observed in Periods 2\u201310); Demand regime elevated \u2014 Periods 7\u20139 mean=1144.67, std\u2248189.79.

Period 12 (2019-09-02) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 Period 12. Lead time has been stable at 1 period across concluded history (arrivals observed for Periods 2\u201311). Recent demand has dropped sharply: last 3 concluded demands = [1019, 308, 294] with last-two very low, indicating a new lower-demand regime. To react quickly I use promised LT (1) and a recent-N demand estimate (N=3) to capture the downturn while retaining some smoothing. These parameters reduce target base-stock to avoid excess holding given holding cost=$1 vs profit=$2 (service quantile q=0.667).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shifted down: last 3 demands mean=540.33 (Periods 9\u201311) and last 2 mean=301.0 (Periods 10\u201311); treat recent lower regime as active.

Period 13 (2019-09-16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-16 P13. On-hand=1660, in-transit=0; no arrivals expected (Period12 ordered=0). Recent demand dropped sharply (P10=308, P11=294, P12=143). Lead time history is stable at 1. I choose L=promised(1). For demand I use recent_N (last 3 periods, P10\u2013P12) to capture the new low regime: mean=(308+294+143)/3=245 so mu_hat=(1+L)*mean=2*245=490. Volatility from same 3-sample regime: sample std\u224891.6, sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std\u22481.4142*91.6\u2248129.6. These parameters lower target base-stock to avoid excess holding cost given the clear recent demand decline while respecting LT=1.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shifted down: recent 3 periods (P10\u2013P12) mean=245, sample std\u224891.6; treat lower-demand regime as active.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-30 (Period 14). Lead time has been observed stable at 1 in concluded periods (P2\u2013P10 arrivals); recent demand regime has shifted down (Periods 10\u201312 recent mean=245, std\u224891.6) and remains low through Period 13 (ending on-hand high at 1595). To avoid excess replenishment given high on-hand, use promised LT=1 and a demand forecast based on the recent low regime (N=3). This keeps base-stock conservative and reduces holding cost exposure while still covering expected demand over review+lead (1+L) periods.

Period 15 (2019-10-14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent concluded periods show lead time stable at 1 (arrivals observed through Period 10 and no evidence of late shipments); demand has clearly shifted down \u2014 last 3 concluded demands (Periods 12\u201314) = [143, 65, 100], mean=102.67, sample std\u224839.08. I set L to promised 1. I use recent_N=3 for demand (capturing the new low-demand regime) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean = 2*102.6667 = 205.3334. sigma_hat uses recent_N=3: sqrt(1+L)*sample_std = sqrt(2)*39.075 = 55.253. These conservative low-demand parameters reduce ordering to avoid holding cost while preserving service against observed variability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime is low: Periods 12\u201314 mean=102.67, sample std\u224839.08; treat lower-demand regime as active.

Period 16 (2019-10-28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 16). On-hand=1402, in-transit=0. Historical arrivals show stable promised lead time=1 (all concluded arrivals from Periods 2\u201315 had LT=1). Demand has shifted to a low regime: recent demands are small (Periods 13\u201315 = 65, 100, 93). I set L to the promised lead time (1). For demand I use recent_N (N=3) to capture the new low-demand regime: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last3) = 2*86 = 172. Sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*sample_std(last3) = sqrt(2)*18.520 = 26.18. These parameters reduce ordering to reflect the sustained low-demand regime and avoid excess holding cost while keeping modest safety stock to cover small variability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime low and persistent: Periods 13\u201315 demands = [65,100,93], mean=86, sample std\u224818.52; use low-demand regime for forecasting until evidence of uplift.

Period 17 (2019-11-11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 17). Lead time has been stable at 1 in concluded history (arrivals observed P2\u2013P16). Demand shows a persistent low regime in recent periods (Periods 14\u201316 demands = [100,93,70], recent 3-mean \u224887.67, sample std \u224815.70). I choose L=promised(1). For forecasting I use recent_N=3 to capture the low-demand regime: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_last3 to keep target base-stock lean; sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*sample_std_last3 to reflect observed low volatility. This reduces holding cost risk given high on-hand (1332) while preserving service for the low-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand low regime persistent: Periods 14\u201316 demands = [100,93,70], recent-3 mean\u224887.67, sample std\u224815.70; use low-demand regime until uplift evidence.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 18). On-hand=1273, in-transit=0; recent demand regime is low and persistent (recent periods show small weekly sales). Promised LT historically stable at 1 period \u2014 use default L=1. Demand forecast set to recent_N (last 3 concluded demands: Periods 15\u201317 = [93,70,59]) because of a clear sustained downward regime; (1+L)*mean => mu_hat limits replenishment to match low demand and avoid heavy holding costs given holding=$1 vs profit=$2. Volatility estimated from the same 3 samples. These parameters bias the OR base-stock low (keep service but reduce holding penalty) while OR backend cap still applies to prevent extreme orders.

Carry-over insight: Low-demand regime persistent: last 3 concluded demands (Periods 15\u201317) mean=74.0, sample std\u224817.35; treat low-demand regime as active until uplift evidence.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09 (Period 19). On-hand=1109, in-transit=0 so no near-term refill needed. Historical concluded lead times consistently 1; keep L=1. Recent demand regime remains low overall; last 3 concluded demands (Periods 16\u201318 = 70, 59, 164) show a small uptick but not a clear sustained regime change. To avoid overstock given high on-hand and holding cost = $1, forecast using the recent-3 demand regime. Selected L=default(promised)=1. mu_hat set via recent_3: (1+L)*mean(last3)=2*97.6667=195.3334 to capture review+lead demand. sigma_hat set via recent_3: sqrt(1+L)*sample_std(last3)=1.4142*57.7\u224881.6 to reflect observed volatility. These parameters keep the backend base-stock low, reducing new receipts while covering short-run demand variability.

Period 20 (2019-12-23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (Period 20). On-hand=994, in-transit=0. Historical arrivals show stable promised lead time=1 (all observed arrivals from past concluded periods had LT=1). Recent demand shows a modest uptick versus the prior low regime: last 3 concluded demands (Periods 17\u201319) = [59, 164, 115], mean=112.67, sample std\u224852.54. To respond quickly to this recent change while keeping inventory discipline (high on-hand), I use L=default (promised=1) and base mu_hat and sigma_hat on the most recent 3-period regime (N=3). This produces mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_recent and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std_recent, capturing current short-term demand uncertainty and limiting over-ordering given large on-hand stock.

Carry-over insight: Recent small demand uptick: Periods 17\u201319 mean=112.67, std\u224852.54; short-term regime shifted up from prior very-low regime\u2014use recent-3 for forecasting until further evidence.
