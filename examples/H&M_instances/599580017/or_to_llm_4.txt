Using initial samples from train.csv: /Users/tianyipeng/Documents/Operations_Research_Code/25-11-supply-chain-agent/OR_Agent/examples/H&M_instances/599580017/train.csv
  Samples: [159, 281, 388, 354, 468]
  Mean: 330.0, Count: 5
Promised lead time (used by OR, shown to LLM): 1 periods (1 period = 14 days)
Note: OR uses promised lead time for recommendations. Actual lead times in CSV may differ.
      LLM must infer actual lead time from arrivals and adjust OR recommendations accordingly.

{
  "rationale": "Date/news: 2019-04-01 (no seasonality signal). Demand evidence: historical sample mean = 330 units, sample SD \u2248 117. OR recommendation (523) is the starting point but appears elevated versus observed mean; OR used promised LT=1 and its capped formula. Lead time: promised LT=1 but no concluded periods yet so treat as 1 for now. Decision: place a smaller order than OR (380 units) \u2014 equals my estimate of base_stock using observed mean (330) plus a moderate safety buffer (z*\xb7\u03c3 \u2248 50) consistent with profit/holding tradeoff. Rationale: preserves a high service level given profit>holding while avoiding excessive holding cost from OR's larger recommendation, and accounts for zero on-hand/in-transit and uncertainty about supplier reliability.",
