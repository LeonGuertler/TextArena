Period 20 (2019-12-23) Hybrid Decision:
============================================================
{
  "rationale": "Date 2019-12-23 (late December) and SKU = swimwear \u2192 out-of-season; recent concluded demand has fallen sharply versus earlier-season peaks. Evidence: Periods 14\u201319 concluded demands = [100,93,70,59,164,115], 6-period avg \u2248100 units/period; Periods 10\u201319 avg \u2248141 units/period, both well below the earlier elevated 800\u20131,300 range. Lead time has been reliably 1 period in concluded history. OR recommends 275 based on full historical data and promised lead time, which overstates current demand and would increase holding cost (holding=$1/unit/period vs profit=$2). With on-hand=899 and no in-transit, we already have ~9\xd7 the current single-period demand and more than enough to cover (L+1)=2 periods. Therefore order 0 to avoid excess holding cost while meeting expected demand.",
