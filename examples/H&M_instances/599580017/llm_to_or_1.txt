Period 1 (2019-04-01) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 decision (2019-04-01). No on-hand or in-transit inventory; promised lead time = 1 and no concluded arrivals in history to contradict it. Historical demands = [159,281,388,354,468], mean=330, std\u2248104.54. Use default lead time (promised=1) because no observed lead-time deviations. Set mu_hat = (1+L)*mean = 2*330 = 660 to cover review+lead demand. Set sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std = sqrt(2)*104.54 \u2248 147.86 to reflect demand variability over review+lead. These parameters keep the OR engine anchored to observed demand while using the promised LT; increases safety stock via the (1+L) multiplier to balance service level vs holding cost given modest profit/holding ratio.
