Period 1 (2019-04-01) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019-04-01): on-hand=0, in-transit=0, no concluded periods to infer lead-time drift. Use promised lead time = 1. Demand history (5 samples) shows mean=330 and std\u2248104.53 (population). Use default formulas: mu_hat=(1+L)*mean to cover review+lead demand; sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std to reflect aggregated variability. These settings give a balanced base-stock with the OR engine's service-level cap and the profit/holding tradeoff (profit=$2, holding=$1) handled downstream.

Period 2 (2019-04-15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15 (Period 2). Historical demand samples = [159,281,388,354,468] => mean=330, std\u2248104.54. Promised LT=1 but last concluded period shows ordered=523 arrived=0 (Period 1), so shipment is overdue; however per sequencing we cannot treat that missing arrival as confirmed LT change. Use default LT=promised to avoid overfitting, keep demand estimates across review+lead (1+L) periods. Parameters chosen use population stats: mu_hat=(1+L)*mean=2*330=660 to cover two-period exposure; sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std=\u221a2*104.54\u2248147.86 to reflect aggregated variability. This balances service level (q=2/(2+1)=0.667 \u2192 z\u22480.431) against holding cost while noting elevated operational risk from the overdue 523-unit shipment.

Carry-over insight: Last order of 523 placed earlier did not arrive by Period 1 conclude (ordered=523, arrived=0) \u2014 treat as potential delayed/lost shipment; monitor subsequent concluded periods for confirmation.

Period 3 (2019-04-29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 decision date 2019-04-29. Recent history: Period1 order (523) that was missing at Period1 conclude DID arrive in Period2 (lead_time observed=1). Current on-hand=0, in-transit=357 (order placed in Period2). No persistent evidence of lead-time drift; treat LT as promised=1. Use default demand estimates from full sample [159,281,388,354,468]: mean=330, (1+L)=2 -> mu_hat=660.0. Sample std\u2248104.56, sqrt(1+L)=\u221a2 -> sigma_hat\u2248148.0. These settings use the OR engine's default scaling for review+lead period and volatility; they provide moderate safety stock given profit/holding (profit $2, holding $1) to balance service level vs holding cost.

Period 4 (2019-05-13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Observed arrivals in concluded periods show consistent 1-period actual lead time (Period2: P1->arrived=523, LT=1; Period3: P2->arrived=357, LT=1). Demand has shifted up sharply in recent periods: last 3 concluded demands = [671, 844, 800] vs earlier historical samples much lower. I treat this as a sustained upward demand regime and use recent_N=3 for demand moments. Set L as recent average of observed lead times (N=2). mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last3) to capture the higher demand over review+lead, sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(last3) to reflect recent volatility. These parameters raise the base-stock to improve fill rate while keeping the OR engine cap in place to limit over-ordering given holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead time=1 based on Period2 and Period3 concluded arrivals (P1->arrived in P2, P2->arrived in P3); Recent demand regime shift: mean of last 3 demands=771.67 (periods 1-3 concluded: 671,844,800) \u2014 treat as new higher-demand regime.

Period 5 (2019-05-27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27 (Period 5). Recent history shows consistent observed lead times =1 (Period1->2, 2->3, 3->4 all arrived after 1 period) and a sustained higher-demand regime: last 4 concluded demands = [671,844,800,787] (mean=775.5, sample std\u224873.79). I set L via average of observed lead times to reflect confirmed LT=1. I use recent_N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new, higher-demand regime (N chosen = regime length =4, meets min 3). mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_recent = 2*775.5 = 1551.0 to size stock for review+lead coverage. sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std_recent = sqrt(2)*73.79 \u2248 104.42 to reflect observed variability over the review+lead window. These parameters raise base-stock to meet elevated demand while sigma scales safety stock appropriately given the 1-period lead time and observed volatility.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed lead time =1 based on Period1->2,2->3,3->4 arrivals; Sustained higher-demand regime: last 4 demands mean=775.5 (periods 1-4: 671,844,800,787).

Period 6 (2019-06-10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 decision (2019-06-10): history shows consistent arrivals one period after ordering for Periods 1->2,2->3,3->4,4->5 so lead time remains 1. Demand has moved to a higher regime: recent concluded demands (Periods 2-5) = [844,800,787,855], showing a higher mean and modest volatility. I set L based on the observed recent lead-time regime (average of observed L=1). For demand I use recent_N=4 to capture the new regime: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last4) to scale across review+lead; sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(last4) to reflect observed variability over the same horizon. These parameters raise the base-stock to protect service level given higher demand while keeping volatility-driven safety stock modest to control holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed lead time=1 based on Periods 1->2,2->3,3->4,4->5 arrivals; Sustained higher-demand regime: mean of last 4 concluded demands=821.5 (Periods 2-5: 844,800,787,855).

Period 7 (2019-06-24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24 (Period 7). History shows consistent realized lead time = 1 (arrivals in P2..P6 each matched orders from prior period). Demand has moved to a higher regime; recent concluded demands (Periods 3-6 = 800, 787, 855, 819) are representative and stable. On-hand=0, in-transit=876 (orders placed in P6). I set L to the promised/confirmed lead time=1. For demand I use recent_N with N=4 (most recent stable regime length) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last4)=2*815.25=1630.5. Volatility uses the same recent 4 samples: sample std \u224825.615; scale by sqrt(1+L)=\u221a2 \u2192 sigma_hat \u224836.24. These parameters raise the base-stock to cover the higher recent demand while keeping sigma scaled for one-period lead variability; using recent N=4 captures the newest regime without overreacting to a single period spike.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed lead time = 1 (observed arrivals P2..P6 matched prior-period orders); sustained higher-demand regime: mean of most recent 4 concluded demands (Periods 3-6) = 815.25.

Period 8 (2019-07-08) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 decision on 2019-07-08. History shows consistent actual lead time = 1 (orders in P1->P2, P2->P3, P3->P4, P4->P5, P5->P6, P6->P7 all arrived after one period). Recent demand regime is elevated; exclude the single large spike in P7 (1363) as an outlier and use the stable recent window (Periods 3-6 demands = [800,787,855,819], mean=815.25) to set forecast. I set L=1 (average observed lead time) to reflect confirmed behavior. I set mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) as (1+L)*mean_recent = 2*815.25 = 1630.5 to cover review+lead demand. I set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4) as sqrt(1+L)*std_recent; std_recent = 25.617 -> sigma_hat = 36.24. These parameters raise target base-stock to service the sustained higher-demand regime while keeping safety stock grounded in observed variability; they also account for the confirmed LT=1 so pipeline calculation will be accurate given arrivals history. Current in-transit=773 will be included by OR engine when computing order quantity.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed lead time = 1 (observed P1->P2, P2->P3, P3->P4, P4->P5, P5->P6, P6->P7 arrivals); sustained higher-demand regime: mean of recent 4 concluded demands (Periods 3-6 = 800,787,855,819) = 815.25.

Period 9 (2019-07-22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-22 (Period 9). Historical concluded arrivals consistently show 1-period actual lead time (orders in Pn arrive in Pn+1) \u2014 no evidence of new delays. Demand has shifted to a higher regime recently: the most recent 4 concluded demands (Periods 5-8 = 855,819,1363,1052) average 1022.25. To target service while controlling holding cost, I use L=1 (promised), set mu_hat using the recent-4 regime to capture the elevated mean across review+lead (1+L=2), and set sigma_hat from the recent-4 sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L) to reflect current variability and avoid underestimating safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed lead time = 1 (observed arrivals P1->P2 through P6->P7); sustained higher-demand regime: recent 4 concluded demands (Periods 5-8) mean = 1022.25.

Period 10 (2019-08-05) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent concluded arrivals consistently show lead time=1. Demand has stepped up sharply in the last 4 concluded periods (Periods 6-9). I set L by averaging observed lead times (=1). For demand I use recent_N (N=4) to capture the new high-demand regime; mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last4)=2*1063.25=2126.5. Volatility uses recent_N (N=4) scaled by sqrt(1+L): std(last4)=224.78 -> sigma_hat=224.78*sqrt(2)=318.0.

Period 11 (2019-08-19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Promised lead time has consistently been observed =1 in concluded periods; use L=1. Demand shows a recent shift and high volatility (periods 7-10 demands = [1363,1052,1019,308]) \u2014 Period 10 is a sharp drop but short window; to respond quickly I use a recent_N=4 regime to capture current average and volatility. This increases base-stock to protect service against the previously high demands while acknowledging the sudden drop by using only the last 4 samples rather than the full history. Parameters chosen: L=1 (promised and confirmed), mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last4 demands)=2*935.5=1871.0 to target service under current regime, sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*sample_std(last4 demands) \u2248 630.8 to reflect observed volatility. These raise safety stock to avoid stockouts given recent high peaks while limiting exposure by using a short recent window.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed lead time = 1 (observed arrivals matching prior-period orders through Period 10); recent demand regime is highly volatile \u2014 last 4 concluded demands (Periods 7-10) = [1363,1052,1019,308], mean=935.5, sample std\u2248446.13; treat recent 4-period regime for forecasting.

Period 12 (2019-09-02) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 12). History shows consistent realized lead time = 1 in concluded periods through Period 11. Recent demand regime is volatile; carry-over analysis uses the most recent 4 concluded demands (Periods 7-10 = 1363,1052,1019,308) with mean=935.5 and sample std\u2248446.13. On-hand = 1662 and in-transit = 187 (pipeline = 187). To prioritize service under high recent demand and volatility while acknowledging substantial on-hand stock, I set L to the confirmed promised lead time (1). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the recent-4 regime to reflect the abrupt, high-variance demand pattern (mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_recent; sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std_recent). These parameters raise the target base-stock and the capped order allowance to protect against stockouts from the recent demand spikes while the large on-hand reduces actual ordering quantity via the backend cap/min logic.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed lead time = 1 (observed arrivals matching prior-period orders through Period 11); recent demand regime highly volatile \u2014 recent 4 concluded demands (Periods 7-10) mean=935.5, std\u2248446.13.

Period 13 (2019-09-16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-09-16. On-hand=1706, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show promised lead time = 1 (every concluded period shows prior-period orders arriving), so use L=1. Recent demand has fallen: last 4 concluded demands (Periods 9-12) = [1019, 308, 294, 143], mean = 441.0 and sample std \u2248 392.09. I use a recent_N forecast (N=4) to capture the latest downshift and high volatility; mu_hat = (1+L)*mean = 2*441.0 = 882.0. Sigma scaled for review+lead: sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*sample_std \u2248 1.4142*392.09 = 554.7. These parameters keep base-stock responsive to the recent lower demand while the inflated sigma preserves safety against volatility and possible delayed/lost shipments observed earlier.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed lead time = 1 based on consistent concluded arrivals through Period 12; recent demand regime has shifted down \u2014 last 4 concluded demands mean=441.0 (Periods 9-12).

Period 14 (2019-09-30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-30 (Period 14). On-hand=1641, in-transit=0. Historical concluded periods through P13 show a clear downward demand shift starting P10\u2013P13 (demands 308,294,143,65). Lead time has been consistently observed as 1 in concluded history. I therefore use L=1 (promised & confirmed). For demand I detect a recent changepoint and use the last 4 concluded periods (P10\u2013P13) to capture the new low-demand regime: mean=(308+294+143+65)/4=202.5 \u2192 mu_hat=(1+L)*mean=405.0. Volatility estimated from the same 4-sample regime: sample std \u2248118.2, scaled by sqrt(1+L) \u2192 sigma_hat\u2248167.2. These parameters tell the OR backend to target a low base stock reflecting the recent collapse in demand while keeping some safety for remaining variability; with on-hand >> mu_hat no immediate order is expected.

Carry-over insight: New sustained downward demand regime: last 4 concluded demands (Periods 10-13)= [308,294,143,65], mean=202.5; treat as current forecast regime.

Period 15 (2019-10-14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-14 (Period 15). Lead time has been consistently observed as 1 in concluded periods. Demand has moved sharply down in recent periods; the most recent four concluded demands (Periods 11-14 = 294,143,65,100) indicate a new lower regime. I use L=1 (promised lead time). I forecast demand across review+lead using recent_N with N=4 to capture the new downward regime: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last4) = 2*150.5 = 301.0. Volatility is set from the same recent window: sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(last4) \u2248 123.56. These choices reduce holding risk given high on-hand (1541) while reflecting the lower recent demand to avoid excess inventory holding costs.

Carry-over insight: New sustained downward demand regime: mean of most recent 4 concluded demands (Periods 11-14 = 294,143,65,100) = 150.5; treat as current forecast regime.

Period 16 (2019-10-28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 16). History shows consistent concluded arrivals with lead time = 1; recent demand has moved to a sustained downward regime. Last 4 concluded demands (Periods 12-15) = [143, 65, 100, 93], mean=100.25, sample std\u224832.27. I use L=promised (1) because arrivals have consistently matched prior-period orders. To reflect the new low-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=4: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_recent = 2*100.25 = 200.5; sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std_recent = sqrt(2)*32.27 \u2248 45.66. These choices lower the base-stock target to avoid excess holding cost given high on-hand inventory (1448 units) and low expected demand.

Carry-over insight: New sustained downward demand regime: recent 4 concluded demands (Periods 12-15) mean=100.25 (143,65,100,93); confirmed lead time = 1 based on consecutive concluded arrivals.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 17). On-hand=1378, in-transit=0. Lead time has been consistently observed as 1 in concluded history (multiple periods P1->P2 through P11->P12 arrivals); no missing arrivals in recent concluded periods \u2014 keep promised LT=1. Demand has fallen to a low, stable regime: last 4 concluded demands (Periods 13-16) = [65,100,93,70], mean=82.0, low volatility (sample std \u224817.11). Use a recent-4 forecast to reflect the sustained downward regime and avoid excess holding cost.

These settings lower the base-stock to match the new low-demand regime and reduce unnecessary orders while preserving service given low volatility.

Period 18 (2019-11-25) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Recent concluded arrivals confirm promised lead time = 1. Demand has shifted sharply down; I use the most recent 4 concluded periods (Periods 14-17 demands = 100,93,70,59) to represent the current regime. Set L by confirmation (method=recent_N with N=4 => 1). mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last4) = 2 * 80.5 = 161.0 to size orders to the new low demand over review+lead. sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(last4) \u2014 sample std \u2248 19.23, so sigma_hat \u2248 27.19 \u2014 captures recent volatility while keeping safety stock low given large on-hand inventory (1319) and no in-transit units.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 decision: on-hand=1155, in-transit=0; promised LT=1 and historical concluded arrivals consistently show LT=1 so use promised lead time. Recent demand shows a downward regime with some volatility but the last 4 concluded demands (Periods 15-18 = 93,70,59,164) give a practical short-term forecast. Use recent_N=4 to capture current regime while reacting to the large spike in Period 18. Set L=1 (promised), mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last4) = 2*96.5 = 193.0 to size stock for review+lead; sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*sample_std(last4) \u2248 1.4142*47.18 = 66.75 to reflect elevated volatility from the spike. This keeps service higher than using long-run low-demand mean while limiting excess holding because on-hand is already high (1155) and there are no in-transit shipments.

Period 20 (2019-12-23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (Period 20). Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 1; no new missing arrivals to contradict. Demand has been in a sustained downward regime but with a small uptick in the last period. I therefore set L to the promised/default (1). I forecast demand using the most recent short-run regime (last 4 concluded demands: periods 16-19 = [70,59,164,115]) to capture the current level and recent volatility. mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_recent and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std_recent so the OR engine targets service for the current low-but-volatile regime while avoiding excess stock given holding cost > profit.

Carry-over insight: New recent regime (Periods 16-19): mean of last 4 concluded demands = 102.0, sample std \u2248 47.91; confirmed lead time = 1.
