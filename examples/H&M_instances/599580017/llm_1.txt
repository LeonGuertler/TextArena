{
  "rationale": "Date/news: 2019-04-01 (early April) \u2014 swimwear season approaching; modest seasonal lift expected into spring/summer. Demand regime: historical unified samples for SKU 599580017 = [159,281,388,354,468]; mean = 330 units/14-day period, with increasing trend toward higher values (recent samples 354,468). No recent concluded periods to indicate any shift from these historical samples. Lead time vs missing orders: supplier promised LT=1, but no concluded arrivals in history to confirm actual LT; treat LT=1 for planning but monitor arrivals. Inventory & pipeline: on-hand = 0, in-transit = 0, no overdue or pending arrivals. Final order logic: order to cover one period of expected demand (mean 330) to balance service level versus high holding cost ($1/unit/period) and profit $2/unit. This aims to meet expected period demand while avoiding excess ending inventory.",
