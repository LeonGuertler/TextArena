This single high observation suggests demand may be higher than prior but is not yet a sustained regime change.

Decision logic: orders placed now would arrive in a future period (not useful for Period 2 demand) so I order for upcoming demand (Period 3+).

No in-transit stock and no overdue shipments in concluded history. Inventory & pipeline: on-hand = 148, in-transit = 0. That on-hand alone covers ~1.5 periods at current demand levels. Forecast & ordering logic: forecast next-period demand \u224895 units with low variance implied by recent data; given high holding cost ($1/unit/period) versus profit ($2/unit sold), avoid tying up capital in extra inventory. Do not place an order now so inventory can deplete toward target service without incurring unnecessary holding cost.
