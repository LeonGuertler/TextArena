Orders placed now will arrive in Period 2 and cannot satisfy Period 1 demand. e) Order logic: target next-period demand while avoiding excessive holding. With L=1 we should cover ~1 future period (Period 2) plus safety for variability; using historical mean ~330, order 660 units to cover ~2 periods of demand once arrivals are observed (balances service vs. holding given Profit=$2 and Holding=$1).",
