Period 1 (2019-04-01) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no concluded arrivals observed so use promised lead time. Historical demand samples = [159,281,388,354,468], mean=330, std\u2248104.53. Use default lead time L=1 (promised). Set mu_hat=(1+L)*mean = 2*330 = 660 to cover review+lead demand. Set sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std = sqrt(2)*104.53 \u2248 147.87 to capture demand variability over review+lead. Profit $2 vs holding $1 implies q\u22480.667 (moderate service target); these parameters let the OR backend compute base-stock and cap balancing service level and holding cost given promised LT and historical demand.

Period 2 (2019-04-15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15 (Period 2). History: Period 1 ordered=523 but arrived=0 (shipment overdue or delayed). Demands past 5 periods = [159,281,388,354,468], mean=330, sample std\u2248116.84. Promised LT=1 but only one concluded period with a missing arrival\u2014insufficient to change lead-time estimate; treat as delayed but keep promised LT to avoid overreacting. Use default aggregation over all samples to keep estimates stable given limited data. Parameters chosen to reflect (1+L)-period demand: mu_hat=(1+1)*330=660; sigma_hat=sqrt(1+1)*116.84\u2248165.2. This raises base-stock for service (z*\u22480.43) while the OR cap will limit order size vs. pipeline (pipeline=523), so we avoid excessive new ordering despite the overdue shipment.

Carry-over insight: Period1 order 523 did not arrive by Period1 conclude (ordered on Period1, arrived=0) \u2014 possible delayed/lost shipment; monitor next conclude to confirm lead-time change.

Period 3 (2019-04-29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Promised LT=1 is confirmed by Period2 conclude: Period1 order 523 arrived in Period2 (lead_time=1). Pipeline=357 equals Period2 order; on-hand=0. Use default lead time. Demand history (samples [159,281,388,354,468], mean=330, std\u2248104.56) shows no recent regime shift. With L=1, set mu_hat=(1+L)*mean=2*330=660 to cover review+lead demand, and sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std=\u221a2*104.56\u2248148 to capture volatility. These parameters keep the OR base-stock anchored to historical mean while the capped order constraint will limit excessive orders given pipeline.

Period 4 (2019-05-13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-05-13. Recent history shows a clear upward demand regime: Periods 1-3 concluded demands = [671, 844, 800] (much higher than earlier baseline samples). Observed lead times from concluded periods: Period1->Period2 (1), Period2->Period3 (1) \u2192 use average lead time =1. Because demand has shifted abruptly and is sustained for 3 periods, I use recent_N=3 for demand estimates. mu_hat set to (1+L)*mean(last 3 demands) = 2 * 771.6667 = 1543.3334 to cover review+lead period under the new regime. sigma_hat set to sqrt(1+L)*std(last 3 demands) where std(population)=73.4039 \u2192 sigma_hat = 1.4142136 * 73.4039 = 103.8016. These parameters raise the base-stock and safety to match the higher demand while L=1 reflects observed delivery behavior.

Carry-over insight: Lead time observed stable at 1 period (Period1->2 =1; Period2->3 =1). Demand regime jumped to high-volume in last 3 concluded periods: mean=771.67 over Periods 1-3; monitor for persistence.

Period 5 (2019-05-27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent history shows a clear upward demand regime: Periods 1-3 concluded demands = [671,844,800] (mean=771.67) and Period 4 demand=787 consistent with the higher regime. All observed arrivals that concluded show lead time = 1. On-hand=0, in-transit=908 (one outstanding order placed in Period 4). To protect service while limiting hold cost, I set L to the observed average lead time (1). I use a recent_N=3 demand estimate to capture the new high-volume regime: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last 3 demands) to size across review+lead; sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(last 3 demands) to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep base-stock tuned to the confirmed higher demand and the observed stable LT while the outstanding in-transit 908 is recognized by the OR pipeline subtraction.

Carry-over insight: Lead time stable at 1 period (observed arrivals: Period1->2=1; Period2->3=1; Period3->4=1); Recent demand regime elevated: last 3 concluded demands mean=771.67 (Periods 1-3) and Period4=787 supports persistence.

Period 6 (2019-06-10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent concluded history shows consistent actual lead times of 1 period (arrivals from Period1->2, 2->3, 3->4, 4->5 all had lead_time=1). Demand has shifted to a higher regime and is persistent across concluded periods (Period1-5 demands = [671,844,800,787,855], mean=791.4). I use L=1 (calculated average of observed lead times). To capture the elevated, persistent demand I use default demand aggregation over all concluded samples: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all demands). Volatility is set with the default scaling: sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all demands). These choices raise the base-stock target to meet the higher observed demand while keeping safety stock proportional to observed variability and the 1-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Lead time stable at 1 period (observed arrivals: Period1->2=1; Period2->3=1; Period3->4=1; Period4->5=1); Demand regime elevated and persistent: Period1-5 mean demand=791.4.

Period 7 (2019-06-24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24 (Period 7). On-hand=0, in-transit=496 (order placed in Period 6). Historical concluded lead times have been stable at 1 (observed arrivals: Period1->2, Period2->3, Period3->4, Period4->5, Period5->6 all =1). Recent demand is elevated and stable across concluded periods: demands = [671,844,800,787,855,819], mean=796.0, sample std\u224866.39. I use the promised lead time L=1 and set demand parameters from all concluded samples to reflect the persistent high-volume regime. This yields mu_hat = (1+L)*mean = 2*796 = 1592.0 and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std \u2248 1.4142*66.39 = 93.91. These parameters increase base-stock to meet the sustained high demand while sigma captures observed variability; using observed LT=1 avoids over-reacting to the earlier single delayed arrival.

Period 8 (2019-07-08) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of 2019-07-08 (Period 8) on-hand=0, in-transit=830. Historical concluded lead times have been stable at 1 period across all observed arrivals (Period1->2, 2->3, 3->4, 4->5, 5->6, 6->7 = 1). Recent demand has stepped up, with a large spike in Period 7 (1363) and elevated levels in Periods 3\u20137. I treat lead time as the promised/default (L=1). To capture the recent higher-demand regime while remaining responsive to the spike, I use recent_N=5 (Periods 3\u20137) for demand estimates: mean(demand_{3..7})=924.8 so mu_hat=(1+L)*mean=2*924.8=1849.6. Volatility estimated from the same 5-sample window: sample std \u2248246.31, scaled by sqrt(1+L) gives sigma_hat\u2248348.3. These parameters raise the base-stock to reflect the persistent higher demand and the Period-1 lead time, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime increased and is persistent: recent demands (Periods 3\u20137 = 800,787,855,819,1363) mean=924.8 (N=5); lead time remains stable at 1 period (observed arrivals all 1).

Period 9 (2019-07-22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-22 (Period 9). Recent history shows stable observed lead time = 1 for every concluded arrival (Periods 1->2 through 7->8). Demand has been elevated and persistent across concluded periods 1\u20138 (demands = [671,844,800,787,855,819,1363,1052]; mean=898.875, higher variance from a large spike in Period 7). I therefore use promised lead time (default L=1) and set demand parameters from the full concluded sample to capture the elevated regime while reflecting realized variance. This raises mu_hat to cover the review+lead horizon and sigma_hat to reflect observed volatility, supporting the OR backend's base-stock calculation and the capped ordering rule to balance service and holding cost.

Period 10 (2019-08-05) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 P10. Historical concluded arrivals show stable lead time =1 (all observed orders from P1->P9 arrived with LT=1). Demand has jumped and persisted recently; last 5 concluded demands (P5\u2013P9 = 855,819,1363,1052,1019) mean=1021.6. I set L by averaging observed lead times (stable at 1). I set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the new high-demand regime: mu_hat=(1+L)*mean_recent = 2*1021.6 = 2043.2 so the base-stock reflects elevated demand over review+lead. I set sigma_hat using recent_N=5: sample std \u2248215.75 scaled by sqrt(1+L) gives sigma_hat \u2248305.1 to capture recent volatility. These parameters raise target stock for service given higher demand while sigma accounts for variability to avoid excessive overstock given holding cost=$1 and profit=$2.

Carry-over insight: Persistent higher demand regime: recent 5-period mean=1021.6 (Periods 5\u20139: 855,819,1363,1052,1019); lead time stable at 1 period (observed P1->P9 arrivals all LT=1).

Period 11 (2019-08-19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19 (Period 11). Promised lead time has been observed stable at 1 in all concluded periods (Period1->2 through Period9->10 all LT=1). Demand has been in a higher regime recently but with one soft period in Period10 (demand=308). To balance service vs holding cost I use a recent-window demand estimate that captures the elevated regime while allowing for the drop: average of the last 5 concluded demands (Periods 6\u201310 = [819,1363,1052,1019,308]) to form mu_hat and sigma_hat. L set to promised (1) given consistent observed arrivals. This increases target base-stock to support service during high demand bursts while sigma_hat reflects observed volatility.

Carry-over insight: Persistent elevated demand regime but increased volatility and one recent low outlier: Periods6\u201310 mean=912.2 (N=5); lead time stable=1 (observed P1->P10 all LT=1).

Period 12 (2019-09-02) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 12). Lead time has been observed consistently as 1 period in concluded history (every concluded arrival links back with lead_time=1). Demand has been in an elevated, volatile regime recently; I use the last 5 concluded demands (Periods 7\u201311 = 1363,1052,1019,308,294) to capture recent mean and volatility while letting OR cap limit extreme orders. Chosen methods: L=average observed lead times (stable at 1). mu_hat = recent_5 \xd7 (1+L) to center base-stock on very recent realized demand (mean of last 5 = 807.2 \u2192 mu_hat = 2\xd7807.2 = 1614.4). sigma_hat = recent_5 scaled by sqrt(1+L) to reflect increased recent volatility (std(last5)=430.43 \u2192 sigma_hat = 430.43\xd7\u221a2 = 608.70). These parameters keep lead-time realistic, raise the target stock for the recent high-demand regime, and increase safety stock to protect service given higher volatility while relying on the OR engine cap to prevent extreme over-ordering.

Period 13 (2019-09-16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-16 (Period 13). LT has been observed stable at 1 in all concluded periods (observed arrivals: Period1->2 through Period11->12 = 1). Recent demand has dropped sharply after a high plateau; last 5 concluded demands (Periods 8\u201312 = 1052, 1019, 308, 294, 143) show a new lower central tendency but high volatility. To balance service vs holding (profit $2, holding $1 \u2192 q\u22480.667), I use promised LT=1 and base demand estimates from the most recent 5 periods to be responsive to the downturn while preserving safety for volatility. mu_hat and sigma_hat are computed across (1+L) period span with N=5 recent samples.

Carry-over insight: Recent demand regime has shifted downward: Periods 8\u201312 mean=563.2 (N=5) vs earlier elevated regime; lead time remains stable at 1 (observed LT=1 across concluded periods).

Period 14 (2019-09-30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-30 (Period 14). Lead time observed stable at 1 in all concluded periods (Period1->Period13 arrivals show LT=1). Recent demand regime has shifted down vs earlier elevated spike: Periods 8\u201312 demands = [1052,1019,308,294,143], mean=563.2, higher volatility. To avoid overstating demand from earlier spikes, set demand parameters from the recent 5-period regime (N=5) and keep L=1 so the OR base-stock reflects current lower mean while accounting for increased variance.

Carry-over insight: Recent demand regime shifted downward: Periods 8\u201312 mean=563.2 (N=5); lead time stable at 1 across concluded periods (Periods1\u201313).

Period 15 (2019-10-14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent history shows a clear downward demand regime in the most recent concluded periods (Periods 10\u201314 demands = 308, 294, 143, 65, 100). Lead time has been stable at 1 in all concluded periods (observed arrivals P1->P14 all with LT=1). I therefore choose L=promised (1) and set demand parameters to reflect the new low-demand regime using the last N=5 samples to avoid overstocking. This reduces target base-stock and cap (lower holding cost exposure) while preserving service against the recent demand pattern.

Period 16 (2019-10-28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 16). Observed lead time has been stable at 1 across all concluded periods (every recorded arrival showed LT=1). Recent demand has declined materially since Period 11 (Periods 11\u201315 demands = 294,143,65,100,93; mean=139), so overall full-history mean is 614.2 but recent window shows a clear downward regime. To be conservative and let the OR engine balance service vs holding cost, I keep L at the promised value (default) and supply demand statistics using all concluded samples (stable long-run estimate) so the backend's capped policy can limit new orders given our large on-hand (1507) and zero in-transit. Using full-history mean inflates mu_hat moderately but the OR cap will prevent over-ordering; sigma_hat uses full-history volatility to reflect past spikes and avoid understock if demand rebounds.

Carry-over insight: New sustained downward demand regime since Period 11: Periods 11\u201315 mean=139.0 (294,143,65,100,93); lead time remains stable=1 (all observed arrivals LT=1).

Period 17 (2019-11-11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 Period17. On-hand is high (1437) and recent concluded periods show a sustained downward demand regime since Period11 (Periods11\u201315 mean=139.0). Lead time observed stable at 1 across all concluded arrivals. To avoid excess holdings I use the recent low-demand regime to set demand forecasts. L set to promised/default=1 (stable evidence). mu_hat: recent_N (N=5, Periods11\u201315 mean=139.0) scaled by (1+L) \u2192 (1+1)*139.0 = 278.0. sigma_hat: recent_N (N=5) using sample std of Periods11\u201315 (sd \u2248 91.03) scaled by sqrt(1+L) \u2192 91.03*\u221a2 \u2248 128.7. These params reduce target base-stock to reflect the new low-demand regime and minimize holding costs given large on-hand inventory while keeping modest safety stock for variability.

Period 18 (2019-11-25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 18). Observed arrivals in concluded periods show lead time stable at 1 (all concluded orders with LT=1). Demand has been in a sustained downward regime since Period 11 (recent demands Periods 11\u201317 = [294,143,65,100,93,70,59], mean=117.71, elevated earlier regime ended). I set L=1 (promised & observed), use recent_N for demand with N=7 (regime length = 7) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_recent to reflect low current demand; sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std_recent to reflect recent volatility. These parameters lower the base stock to avoid heavy holding cost given large on-hand (1378) and no in-transit units, while keeping safety for observed variability.

Carry-over insight: Sustained downward demand regime since Period 11: Periods 11\u201317 mean=117.71 (294,143,65,100,93,70,59); observed lead time stable=1 across concluded periods.

Period 20 (2019-12-23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (Period 20). On-hand=1099, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show stable promised lead time = 1 across all concluded periods (observed P1->P19 arrivals all LT=1). Demand clearly shifted down starting Period 11; recent concluded demands (Periods 11\u201319) = [294,143,65,100,93,70,59,164,115] with mean \u2248122.56 and elevated relative volatility. To avoid overstocking given high on-hand, set L to the promised lead time (1). Use a recent-N demand estimate to capture the sustained lower regime (N=9, Periods 11\u201319). mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_recent = 2 * 122.5556 = 245.1112. sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L) * std_recent; sample std of the 9 recent demands \u224873.3649, so sigma_hat \u2248103.730. These parameters bias orders down to reflect the new low-demand regime while keeping a modest safety buffer for observed volatility; this reduces holding cost risk given large on-hand inventory and stable LT=1.

Carry-over insight: Sustained downward demand regime since Period 11: Periods 11\u201319 mean=122.56 (N=9); observed lead time stable=1 across concluded periods.
