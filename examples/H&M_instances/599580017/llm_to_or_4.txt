Using initial samples from train.csv: /Users/tianyipeng/Documents/Operations_Research_Code/25-11-supply-chain-agent/OR_Agent/examples/H&M_instances/599580017/train.csv
  Samples: [159, 281, 388, 354, 468]
  Mean: 330.0, Count: 5
Promised lead time (shown to LLM): 1 periods (1 period = 14 days)
Note: Actual lead times in CSV may differ and will be inferred by LLM from arrivals.
Set NUM_DAYS to 1 periods based on CSV (limited from 20)

Period 1 (2019-04-01) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 1). No on-hand or in-transit inventory. Historical demands = [159,281,388,354,468] (mean=330). Promised lead time = 1 and no concluded arrivals to contradict it. Use default lead time to avoid overreacting to missing future arrivals. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat from full-sample defaults: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean to size the review+lead demand; sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples) to reflect observed volatility. These parameters give the OR engine a balanced base-stock targeting service vs. holding cost given Profit=$2 and Holding=$1 (q=0.667) without evidence of regime shift.
