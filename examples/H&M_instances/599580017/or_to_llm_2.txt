Demand evidence: historical sample mean \u2248330 units (samples: 159,281,388,354,468). Lead time: supplier promised LT=1, but no concluded periods yet to confirm; assume LT=1 until evidence otherwise.

Adjustment: modestly increase above OR to cover seasonal uplift risk while avoiding excessive holding cost (profit:$2 vs holding:$1 favors some service-level uplift but caution on overstock).

Given: (a) a very large pipeline position (1,237) likely to cover one high demand period, (b) high holding cost ($1/unit) vs moderate profit ($2/unit) making over-ordering costly, and (c) uncertainty whether the in-transit shipment will arrive this decision step but strong historical evidence LT=1 so arrival is likely, I choose to refrain from placing any new order now to avoid excess holding cost if the large shipment does arrive.

Period 20 (2019-12-23) Hybrid Decision:
============================================================
{
  "rationale": "Date 2019-12-23. Lead time = 1 (confirmed through Periods 2\u201317 arrivals); recent demand has been in a sustained low regime (short-run mean \u2248144\u2013164 over Periods 10\u201318, recent demands 164 then 115). On-hand=56, in-transit=0, so next-period demand must be covered by new order arriving after this decision. OR recommends 1103 (built from historical high demand); that is inconsistent with the sustained September\u2013November downturn and would incur heavy holding cost. I therefore scale the OR suggestion way down: target next-period expected demand \u2248144 and maintain a small buffer. Order = 100 units to cover expected demand while limiting holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1.",
