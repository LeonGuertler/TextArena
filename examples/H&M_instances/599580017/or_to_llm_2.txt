Actual lead time confirmed = 1 period from concluded history. On-hand=870 and in-transit=0 \u2014 this stock already covers many future periods at current demand rates. OR recommends 304 based on longer-horizon historical mean; that would substantially raise holding cost (holding=$1/unit/period) with little incremental sales upside given the sustained lower demand. To maximize R_t (Profit\xd7sales \u2212 HoldingCost\xd7ending_inventory) I will not order this period and carry down inventory instead of increasing holding cost.",
