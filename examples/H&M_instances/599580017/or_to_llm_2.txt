Using initial samples from train.csv: /Users/tianyipeng/Documents/Operations_Research_Code/25-11-supply-chain-agent/OR_Agent/examples/H&M_instances/599580017/train.csv
  Samples: [159, 281, 388, 354, 468]
  Mean: 330.0, Count: 5
Promised lead time (used by OR, shown to LLM): 1 periods (1 period = 14 days)
Note: OR uses promised lead time for recommendations. Actual lead times in CSV may differ.
      LLM must infer actual lead time from arrivals and adjust OR recommendations accordingly.
Set NUM_DAYS to 1 periods based on CSV (limited from 20)

Period 1 (2019-04-01) Hybrid Decision:
============================================================
{
  "rationale": "Date 2019-04-01 (Period 1). No on-hand or in-transit stock; no concluded periods to infer actual lead time so use supplier-promised LT=1 as prior. Historical sample mean demand = 330 units/period (samples: 159,281,388,354,468) with sample SD \u2248117. OR recommends 523 units (capped baseline) which is aggressive versus the observed mean and given holding cost = $1/unit/period. Profit/(profit+holding)=2/(2+1)=2/3 \u2192 z*\u22480.43, implying a moderate safety stock (~0.43\xb7SD \u224850). Base-stock \u2248 mean + safety \u2248 380. With zero pipeline I order to bring inventory up to that base-stock while avoiding excessive holding cost. Therefore I reduce OR's recommendation from 523 to 380 units to balance service and holding costs given current info and no evidence of a demand surge or LT issues.",
