Period 1 (2019-04-01) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. On-hand=0, in-transit=0, promised lead time=1 and no concluded arrivals in history to contradict it, so use promised LT. Historical demand samples = [159,281,388,354,468], mean=330.0, population std=104.53. Using default formulas: L=1 -> mu_hat=(1+L)*mean=2*330=660.0; sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std=sqrt(2)*104.53\u2248147.9. Defaults keep safety stock consistent with observed variability and the promised LT; avoids overreacting to no new signals while giving OR engine the correct review+lead demand stats to compute base-stock and cap.

Period 2 (2019-04-15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15 (Period 2). Promised LT=1 but the Period 1 order (523) did not arrive in its concluding record; however, no concluded arrival history gives an observed lead time so I keep L at the promised value. Use full-sample defaults: mean demand across historical samples = 330 units; with L=1 the review+lead demand forecast mu_hat = (1+L)*mean = 660. Volatility: sample std = 104.53, scaled by sqrt(1+L)=\u221a2 gives sigma_hat \u2248 147.9. These defaults provide the OR engine with a baseline base-stock while remaining conservative given the missed arrival (we do not yet assume permanent longer lead time or lost shipment).

Carry-over insight: Period 1: ordered=523 arrived=0 (expected LT=1) \u2014 possible delayed/lost shipment; monitor subsequent concluded periods for confirmed lead-time change.

Period 3 (2019-04-29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 3). History shows an order placed in Period 1 arrived in Period 2 (lead time=1); no sustained evidence of delayed or lost shipments since. On-hand=0, in-transit=357 (pipeline). Use promised lead time L=1. Demand mean of all samples = 330 units; (1+L)*mean = 660. Sample std dev \u2248 116.84; sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std \u2248 165.2. These parameters raise target base-stock to cover two-period demand while the sigma term increases safety stock for observed variability; using default methods keeps estimates conservative given limited data and no confirmed LT drift.

Daily Reward (R_t): $714.00

Period 4 (2019-05-13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent concluded periods show high, persistent demand vs the older small-sample prior: Period1-3 concluded demands = [671, 844, 800], indicating a clear upward regime vs earlier baseline. Lead-time observations: orders placed in Period1\u2192arrived in Period2 (LT=1) and Period2\u2192arrived in Period3 (LT=1) \u2014 LT=1 is confirmed. I therefore set L = calculate (average observed lead times =1). For demand I detect a changepoint to the recent high-demand regime; I use recent_N on the last 3 concluded demands to form (1+L)-period demand forecast: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last 3 demands). Volatility is set from the same recent window: sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(last 3 demands). These parameters raise base-stock to cover the new higher demand while keeping sigma estimated from recent variability; this balances higher service level needs against holding cost given profit $2 and holding $1 (q=0.667 => target service high).

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed at 1 period based on arrivals: Period2 arrival of Period1 order (LT=1) and Period3 arrival of Period2 order (LT=1); initial missing arrival in Period1 was a 1-period delay rather than a lost shipment.

Period 5 (2019-05-27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27. History shows three observed concluded lead times = 1 (Period2 arrival of P1 order, Period3 arrival of P2, Period4 arrival of P3) so LT=1 is confirmed. On-hand=0, in-transit=908 (matches Period4 ordered=908). Demand sample set = [159,281,388,354,468] (mean=330, std\u2248104.54). I use L=1 (calculated average observed LT). I select default mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) = 2*330 = 660 to represent expected demand over review+lead, and default sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples) \u2248 1.4142*104.54 \u2248 148.0 to capture observed variability. Using defaults keeps parameters grounded in observed demand and confirmed LT, letting the OR backend compute the service-level z given profit/(profit+holding)=2/(2+1)=0.666.. while the capped-order logic will limit order size. This balances service level (moderate fill rate target) against holding cost given high in-transit stock.

Period 6 (2019-06-10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
History shows consistent observed lead times of 1 period (Period2-5 arrivals all LT=1). No current overdue/lost shipments in concluded history. On-hand=53 + in-transit=303 = 356, which is well below demand over review+lead (\u22481583), so OR should target substantially higher base stock. Use L calculated from observed lead times=1. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (no recent changepoint detected) to let the OR engine compute base stock and cap using full-sample demand stats.

Period 7 (2019-06-24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
History shows consistent realized lead time of 1 period across concluded periods (Period2\u20136 arrivals each matched LT=1). On-hand=0, pipeline=924 (order placed in Period6). Demand history samples = [159,281,388,354,468], mean=330, std\u2248104.54. I use promised/observed L=1 (default), mu_hat as default (1+L)*mean = 660 to represent expected demand across review+lead, and sigma_hat as default sqrt(1+L)*std = 147.9 to reflect demand uncertainty over the (1+L) horizon. These settings keep the OR engine\u2019s base-stock tied to historical mean but inflate safety stock for one-period lead-time risk; current pipeline (924) already exceeds mu_hat, flagging a likely overhang but parameters avoid further aggressive ordering.

Period 8 (2019-07-08) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-08 (Period 8). History shows consistent 1-period actual lead time on concluded periods (Periods 2\u20137 arrivals all match LT=1). Recent demand exhibits a clear upward jump in Period 7 (1363 vs prior ~800s). I treat LT as the promised/default 1. For demand I detect a changepoint with elevated demand in the last 3 periods (Periods 5\u20137 = 855, 819, 1363) and use recent_N=3 to capture the new regime. This raises the forecasted review+lead demand and increases safety stock to avoid stockouts given the spike. Parameters chosen: L=1 (default), mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last 3) to reflect the current high-demand regime, sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(last 3) to reflect increased volatility; these raise base-stock and the OR capped-order will limit extreme orders via its cap.

Period 10 (2019-08-05) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-08-05. History shows consistent 1-period arrivals in concluded periods (Periods 2\u20139), so promised LT=1 is confirmed. On-hand=494, in-transit=54 (these are pipeline units arriving after my decision). Demand has increased since Period 5; most recent regime (Periods 5\u20139 demands = 855,819,1363,1052,1019) better reflects current volume. I set L to the promised 1. I set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the higher recent mean: mu_hat=(1+L)*mean(recent5)=2*1021.6=2043.2. I set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture elevated volatility: std(recent5)=~215.7, sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std=1.4142*215.7=305.0. These choices increase base-stock and safety to reduce stockouts given the upward demand shift while acknowledging holding cost (profit/holding =2), letting the OR engine compute z from service-level tradeoff.

=== Period 11 Summary ===
599580017: ordered=0, arrived=1377 units (ordered on Period 10, lead_time was 1 periods), starting on-hand inventory=1617, demand=294, sold=294, ending on-hand inventory=1323

Daily Reward (R_t): $-735.00

Period 12 (2019-09-02) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02. On-hand=1323, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent 1-period lead time since Period2\u2013Period11 (confirmed LT=1); no recent demand regime change in the provided demand samples. Use promised/default lead time and demand stats from all samples to avoid overfitting to recent fluctuations. This yields mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) to set the OR base-stock around historical demand over review+lead, and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples) to capture volatility; these parameters balance service (profit=$2 vs holding=$1) without ramping safety stock for unproven shifts.

Period 13 (2019-09-16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Lead time remains 1 period (history shows consistent LT=1 arrivals in concluded periods). No recent demand regime change detected in the provided samples. Using default methods: L=promised LT to match observed arrivals; mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) = 2*330 = 660 to cover review+lead demand; sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples) = sqrt(2)*104.53 \u2248 147.8 to reflect observed volatility. These parameters keep the OR base-stock anchored to historical mean demand while scaling safety stock for one-period lead time and observed variability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-1179.00

Period 14 (2019-09-30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Promised LT=1 is confirmed by multiple concluded periods (Period2 arrival of P1 order, Period3 arrival of P2 order, etc.). Demand history (provided samples [159,281,388,354,468]) has mean 330 and sample std \u2248116.85. I use default methods tied to L=1 to let the OR engine compute base-stock and capped order; this keeps parameters data-driven and responds to the confirmed LT while avoiding overreacting to recent inventory fluctuations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-1099.00

Period 15 (2019-10-14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
History shows consistent 1-period arrivals in concluded periods (Periods 2\u201314); initial missing arrival was a 1-period delay not a lost shipment, so use promised LT=1. Demand sample set = [159,281,388,354,468], mean=330, std\u2248104.53. Use default formulas to keep OR backend aligned with historical stats: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean = 660 to size review+lead demand; sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std \u2248 147.87 to reflect observed variability. This keeps service-level calculation honest given confirmed LT=1 and current healthy on-hand (1299) + small in-transit (11).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-1031.00

Period 16 (2019-10-28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28. History shows consistent concluded lead times of 1 period (multiple periods confirm arrivals = orders from prior period). Past demand samples = [159,281,388,354,468] (mean=330, std\u2248116.86). Promised LT=1 is validated; use default lead time. Using default formulas: mu_hat=(1+L)*mean = 2*330 = 660 to cover review+lead demand; sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std = sqrt(2)*116.86 \u2248 165.3 to reflect demand variability over the combined period. These parameters keep the OR engine's base-stock at a moderate service level (q = profit/(profit+holding)=2/3) while capping orders via the engine's cap to limit overstock given substantial on-hand (1217) and small in-transit (53).

Period 17 (2019-11-11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 17). On-hand=1200, in-transit=49. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent observed lead time = 1 (Periods 2\u201316 arrivals all match orders with LT=1 after the initial resolved delay), so use promised lead time. Use default demand estimators from supplied samples [159,281,388,354,468]: mean=330, std(sample)=116.86. With L=1: mu_hat=(1+L)*mean=660 to cover review+lead demand; sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std=165.30 to reflect demand variability over the review+lead window. These parameters keep base-stock tied to recent long-run demand while the confirmed LT=1 keeps pipeline accounting accurate; they balance the profit/holding tradeoff (q=2/3) without inflating safety stock for unobserved LT drift.

Historical demand samples mean = 330 units; using default (1+L)*mean => mu_hat=660 to cover review+lead demand.
