Using initial samples from train.csv: /Users/tianyipeng/Documents/Operations_Research_Code/25-11-supply-chain-agent/OR_Agent/examples/H&M_instances/599580017/train.csv
  Samples: [159, 281, 388, 354, 468]
  Mean: 330.0, Count: 5
Promised lead time (used by OR, shown to LLM): 1 periods (1 period = 14 days)
Note: OR uses promised lead time for recommendations. Actual lead times in CSV may differ.
      LLM must infer actual lead time from arrivals and adjust OR recommendations accordingly.
Set NUM_DAYS to 1 periods based on CSV (limited from 20)

Period 1 (2019-04-01) Hybrid Decision:
============================================================
{
  "rationale": "Date/news: 2019-04-01 (no special seasonality signals). Demand evidence: historical sample mean=330 units/period, sd\u2248104.5. Lead-time evidence: no concluded arrivals in history yet; supplier promised LT=1 but we have no confirmed arrivals \u2014 treat LT=1 as tentative. OR recommendation: 523 units (capped policy) \u2014 starts from a larger base stock that likely embeds OR's LT assumption and a high safety buffer. Adjustment: compute base_stock from sample mean+z*\xb7sd with z*=\u03a6\u22121(2/3)\u22480.43 \u2192 base_stock\u2248330+0.43\xb7104.5\u2248375. With on-hand=0 and in-transit=0, any order now cannot satisfy Period 1 demand (sequencing). To balance service level vs holding cost (profit=$2, holding=$1), I reduce OR's large recommendation to the statistically justified base_stock of 375 units to avoid excessive holding cost while preserving a reasonable safety buffer for future periods. Final qty gives a high probability of meeting one-period-ahead demand without overstocking.",
