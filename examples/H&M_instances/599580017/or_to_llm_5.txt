Evidence: historical mean demand \u2248330/day-sample \u2192 2-period demand \u03bc\u0302\u2248660; sample std dev implies \u03c3\u0302\u2248165. OR recommended 357 (uses promised L=1). Reality check: on-hand=0, in-transit=523 (Period 1 order placed=523 visible) and Period 1 demand was 671 (large single-period spike). Actual lead time cannot be inferred yet (no concluded arrivals), so shipments may be delayed but not proven lost. Interpretation: OR's cap/stocking logic yields a smaller incremental order (~208) given pipeline=523, but observed demand (671) suggests a one-period surge; to protect service while avoiding excessive holding cost I increase the order modestly above OR's implicit uncapped need but below OR's recommendation.

Period 20 (2019-12-23) Hybrid Decision:
============================================================
{
  "rationale": "Date 2019-12-23 (pre-Christmas low-risk for this SKU). Concluded history shows a sustained downshift in demand since Period 10: recent concluded demands are low (Periods 14\u201319: 100,93,70,59,164,115) with a recent mean \u2248141\u2013167 units/period and high on-hand inventory (961) and zero in-transit. Actual lead time observed from concluded messages = 1 period (orders historically arrive one period later). OR recommends 213 using long-history and promised LT, but with current on-hand \u226b expected next-period demand and holding cost = $1/unit/period (high relative to $2 profit), placing additional orders would increase holding penalties and likely reduce objective. I therefore place no order to avoid unnecessary holding cost while meeting near-term demand from on-hand stock.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Recent sustained demand decline: mean \u2248141.5 units/period (Periods 10\u201319 evidence) and std \u224898; actual lead time = 1 period (each order historically arrived one period after ordering).",
