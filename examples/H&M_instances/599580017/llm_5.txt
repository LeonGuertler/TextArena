  "rationale": "Date/news: Period start 2019-04-01 (early April) \u2014 swimwear demand typically rising into spring/summer; recent samples show increasing demand. Demand regime: historical unified samples for SKU 599580017 = [159,281,388,354,468]; recent three-sample average = (388+354+468)/3 = 403 \u2192 evidence of upward demand vs long-run mean ~330. Lead time & arrivals: no concluded periods in history to observe actual arrivals; supplier promised LT=1 but per rules we cannot confirm actual LT yet. Inventory & pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=0 so no coverage for current or next period; any order placed now will not affect Period 1 demand (sequencing) and would arrive in next period if LT=1. Final order logic: be conservative but responsive to upward trend \u2014 target coverage for next selling period \u2248 400 units (close to recent 3-period average) to avoid stockout while limiting holding cost (holding=$1/unit/period vs profit $2).",
