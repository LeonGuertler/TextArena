============================================================
{
  "rationale": "a) Date/news: Period 1 = 2019-04-01 (early April, pre-summer swim season beginning but not peak); no special holiday effects. b) Demand regime: use provided historical sample [159,281,388,354,468] -> mean \u2248 330 units/period; recent samples trending up but short series, treat mean\u2248330 as baseline. c) Lead time: supplier promised LT=1 but no concluded arrivals yet to confirm; must treat LT as 1 for planning but remain alert for missed arrivals later. d) Inventory & pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=0, so current period demand will be stockout regardless of decision now. Orders placed now will arrive after this period (before Period 2 demand). e) Final order logic: order to cover expected Period 2 demand. With profit=$2 and holding=$1 per period, over-ordering is costly; target order \u2248 baseline mean demand with minimal safety stock. Action: order 330 units to arrive for next period.",
