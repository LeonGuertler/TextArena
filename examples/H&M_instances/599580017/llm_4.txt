No in-period demand history yet to indicate a regime shift. c) Lead time: supplier promised LT=1 but no concluded arrivals in history to confirm; treat LT=1 for ordering but remain conservative (cannot infer delays yet). d) Inventory & pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=0, so there is no inventory to meet future demand. e) Final order logic: holding cost is high ($1/period vs $2 profit), so avoid large forward builds.
