{
  "rationale": "a) Date/news: 2019-04-01 (early April). Swimwear typically ramps in spring toward summer, so demand likely at or above historical average. No special holiday in early April that would sharply change short-term demand. b) Demand regime: Prior unified historical samples for SKU 599580017 = [159,281,388,354,468], mean = 330 units/period; variance is moderate and recent samples show an upward trend toward higher values (354,468), supporting at least baseline mean \u2248330 and possible upside. c) Lead time & missing orders: Promised lead time = 1 period; no concluded periods yet to infer actual lead time. No in-transit or past arrivals to indicate delays or losses. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand = 0, In-transit = 0. With L=1, decision must cover current period demand (occurs after decision) plus next period (L+1 = 2 periods). e) Final order logic: Use historical mean \u2248330 units/period \xd7 2 periods = 660 units to cover expected demand for current and next period. This balances service (high shortage cost because profit per sale is only realized if stocked) versus holding cost ($1/period/unit). Given limited evidence of lead-time drift, do not add extra safety beyond the 2-period cover this period. Order = 660.",
