Using initial samples from train.csv: /Users/tianyipeng/Documents/Operations_Research_Code/25-11-supply-chain-agent/OR_Agent/examples/H&M_instances/599580017/train.csv
  Samples: [159, 281, 388, 354, 468]
  Mean: 330.0, Count: 5
Promised lead time (used by OR, shown to LLM): 1 periods (1 period = 14 days)
Note: OR uses promised lead time for recommendations. Actual lead times in CSV may differ.
      LLM must infer actual lead time from arrivals and adjust OR recommendations accordingly.

{
  "rationale": "Date: 2019-04-01 (start of April; no special seasonality signals). Historical demand mean = 330 units (samples: 159,281,388,354,468), sample SD \u2248 117. Promised LT = 1 (supplier stated), but no concluded arrivals yet to contradict it. OR baseline recommends 523 (uses its own statistics and a higher service factor). Given profit = $2 and holding = $1 per period (q = 2/3 \u2192 moderate service target), I favor a leaner position to avoid high holding cost on unproven upside. Base-stock using \u03bc + z*\u03c3 with z\u22480.43 (q\u22480.667) \u2192 ~380 units. No in-transit or on-hand inventory to protect; ordering 380 balances service level and holding cost and aligns with the OR recommendation direction (order less than OR's 523 due to high holding penalty and no evidence of demand surge).",
