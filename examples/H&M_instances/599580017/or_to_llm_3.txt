Actual lead time has been consistently 1 period in concluded messages, and there are currently 0 in-transit units. OR's recommendation (370) uses older/higher demand and the promised LT, so it overestimates current need. With profit $2 and holding $1, holding cost is high relative to profit; we should avoid building excess inventory. On-hand = 836 already comfortably covers expected (L+1)=2 periods demand (\u2248288). Therefore order 0 to minimize holding cost while meeting near-term demand from existing stock.",

Period 20 (2019-12-23) Hybrid Decision:
============================================================
{
  "rationale": "Date 2019-12-23: SKU is seasonal swimwear but current on-hand is very large (721) and recent concluded demands (Periods 10\u201319 = 308,294,143,65,100,93,70,59,164,115) show a sustained low-demand regime (recent mean \u2248144 u/period). Lead time has been reliably 1 period in concluded history. OR's capped recommendation (453) ignores the recent downward regime and would create high holding cost. With profit $2 and holding $1, marginal profit per additional unit sold is small vs. holding cost if inventory sits unsold. Given on-hand (721) covers multiple future periods at current demand, I place no order to avoid unnecessary holding cost while preserving service. ",
