Using initial samples from train.csv: /Users/tianyipeng/Documents/Operations_Research_Code/25-11-supply-chain-agent/OR_Agent/examples/H&M_instances/610776002/train.csv
  Samples: [323, 393, 574, 622, 535]
  Mean: 489.4, Count: 5
Promised lead time (used by OR, shown to LLM): 1 periods (1 period = 14 days)
Note: OR uses promised lead time for recommendations. Actual lead times in CSV may differ.
      LLM must infer actual lead time from arrivals and adjust OR recommendations accordingly.

{
  "rationale": "Date/news: 2019-03-18 (no special seasonal signal). Current state: on-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we will stock for future periods; due to sequencing an order placed now will NOT affect Period 1 demand (arrivals from LT=1 come in Period 2). Demand evidence: historical sample mean \u2248489.4 units/period, sd \u2248126.3. OR recommended 698 units (baseline start). Interpretation and adjustment: OR's suggestion is generous relative to the historical mean and would incur high holding cost (holding=$1/unit/period vs profit=$2/unit). I scale the OR recommendation down toward the demand mean plus a modest safety buffer to balance service level and holding cost. Final qty (490) aims to cover a typical next-period demand (\u2248489) without excessive ending inventory risk.",
