Using initial samples from train.csv: /Users/tianyipeng/Documents/Operations_Research_Code/25-11-supply-chain-agent/OR_Agent/examples/H&M_instances/610776002/train.csv
  Samples: [323, 393, 574, 622, 535]
  Mean: 489.4, Count: 5
Promised lead time (used by OR, shown to LLM): 1 periods (1 period = 14 days)
Note: OR uses promised lead time for recommendations. Actual lead times in CSV may differ.
      LLM must infer actual lead time from arrivals and adjust OR recommendations accordingly.

{
  "rationale": "Date 2019-03-18: no news/seasonality signals. Historical sample mean demand \u2248489 units/period, sample SD \u2248126. OR recommended 698 units but its recommendation appears high given holding cost = $1 (relative to profit $2). Using the OR capped logic (base_stock from historical \u03bc and service z plus the cap \u03bc/(1+L)+\u03a6\u22121(0.95)\xb7\u03c3/\u221a(1+L)) yields a cap \u2248392 units. On-hand and in-transit are 0, so ordering 392 brings pipeline+on-hand toward a reasonable service level while limiting holding cost exposure. I therefore scale OR down to the capped, conservative quantity to balance service and holding costs.",
