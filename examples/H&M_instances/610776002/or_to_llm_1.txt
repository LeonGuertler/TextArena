Lead-time evidence: LT = 1 period (multiple concluded periods show orders arriving one period later). Demand/forecast: recent demands in concluded Periods 8\u201310 = [533, 450, 361] \u2192 short-term mean \u2248 448 units/period (clear downward shift from earlier high-week spikes). Inventory reconciliation: on-hand=285; in-transit total=242 (these are from prior orders and will arrive after my decision per sequencing, so pipeline before arrivals = 285 on-hand; expected pipeline coverage for next period should cover ~448 units). OR recommendation = 869 units (capped baseline using historical high-demand mean) \u2014 I treat this as starting point but reduce it because recent 3-period evidence shows demand has dropped materially and holding cost = $1/unit is high relative to profit $2, so I avoid overstock. Decision logic: target pipeline \u2248 mean*(1+LT) \u2248 448*(1+1)=896 units to cover this period plus next given LT=1; current known pipeline before arrivals effectively includes on-hand 285 (cannot rely on arrivals showing up before my decision), so order \u2248 896 \u2212 285 = 611. However because the environment sequencing means the in-transit 242 is already committed to arrive this period (but I cannot see it before deciding and holding cost penalizes ending stock), I temper aggressively toward the shorter 3-period mean and add modest safety. To avoid both stockouts and excess holding, I order 373 units \u2014 this raises likely available inventory after arrivals to satisfy demand while keeping holding costs reasonable. This also corrects OR's over-conservative high suggestion given recent downward demand evidence.",
