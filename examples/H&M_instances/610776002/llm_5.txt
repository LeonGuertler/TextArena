{
  "rationale": "a) Date/context: Period 1 (2019-03-18), early spring; no special holiday impact implied. b) Demand regime: historical unified samples for SKU 610776002 = [323, 393, 574, 622, 535]; mean \u2248 489 units/period, median 535 \u2014 no evidence of a regime shift in history. c) Lead time vs missing orders: no concluded periods or arrivals in history to confirm actual lead time; supplier-promised LT=1 but not yet verifiable. d) Inventory & pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=0, so no arrivals will come before current demand; any order placed now will not affect Period 1 sales. e) Order logic: maximize expected profit while limiting holding drag. Expected demand next period ~489 units (historical mean). Profit per unit = $2, holding = $1/period -> stocking is profitable if sell probability > 0.5; using historical mean as point forecast and conservative approach given unverified LT, place an order to cover ~mean demand for next period: 489 units.",
