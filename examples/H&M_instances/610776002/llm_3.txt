============================================================
{
  "rationale": "a) Date/news: Period 1 = 2019-03-18 (mid-March, start of spring); no special holiday spikes expected. b) Demand regime: prior unified samples for SKU 610776002 = [323,393,574,622,535], sample mean \u2248489 units/14-day period; no in-period history to indicate a regime shift. c) Lead time vs missing orders: on-hand=0, in-transit=0 and no concluded arrivals in history -> cannot infer any arrival; promised LT=1 but arrivals from an order placed today will not be visible until the next decision. d) Inventory & pipeline: since on-hand=0 and there are no in-transit shipments, Period 1 demand will be lost; ordering now only affects Period 2 onward. e) Final order logic: target stock for next period set to the empirical mean demand (~489). Given high holding cost ($1/unit/period) vs profit ($2/unit), avoid large overstock; place an order to cover expected Period 2 demand (~489) rounded to 490 units.",
