  "rationale": "a) Date/news: Period 1 (2019-03-18) \u2014 no special holiday/seasonality signal for late March that would sharply alter demand. b) Demand regime: use historical unified samples [323,393,574,622,535] \u2192 mean \u2248489 units per 14-day period; no evidence yet of a new regime. c) Lead time / missing orders: no prior orders or concluded periods; supplier promised LT=1 but no confirmed arrivals yet; assume LT=1 for ordering but be conservative about overstock. d) Inventory & pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=0 \u2192 no available inventory for upcoming demand. e) Final order logic: balance high expected demand (mean\u2248489) against holding cost ($1/unit/period) and profit ($2/unit sold). Ordering to roughly the historical mean captures expected sales while limiting overstock risk. Order 489 units.",
