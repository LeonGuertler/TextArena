{
  "rationale": "Date 2019-12-09 (Period 20). Recent concluded history shows supplier lead time stable at 1 period (multiple arrivals matched orders with LT=1 through Period 19), so I expect the in-transit 100 to arrive in this period before demand. Demand has shifted down from earlier peaks \u2014 recent periods (P13\u2013P19) demands = [286,282,191,193,139,136,170], recent mean \u2248199 units/period and lower volatility. OR's capped recommendation (919) reflects an older, higher-demand estimate and the promised LT; following it would incur large holding cost relative to marginal profit. Given on-hand 36 + expected arrival 100 = 136 available before demand, and expected demand \u2248200, I top up conservatively to avoid heavy holding cost while keeping a modest buffer. Order set to 100 units (places pipeline to cover ~1\u20131.5 periods of expected demand while limiting holding exposure). This adapts the OR suggestion downward because real demand is lower and LT appears reliable at 1.",

{
  "rationale": "Date 2019-12-23 (P21). Recent concluded history shows supplier lead time stable at 1 period and recent demand regime is low (Periods 13\u201320 average \u2248199 units; P20 demand=119). On-hand=17 and in-transit=100 (expected to arrive with LT=1 after ordering decision but before demand). OR baseline recommends 911 (uses long-run/higher demand). I override: target coverage = next-period expected demand (~199) minus expected available after arrival (17+100=117) = 82, plus a modest safety buffer (~40) given demand variability \u2192 order \u2248120. This balances service (avoid stockout) vs holding cost (high holding relative to profit), and respects observed lower-demand regime and reliable LT=1.",
