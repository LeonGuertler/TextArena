Using initial samples from train.csv: /Users/tianyipeng/Documents/Operations_Research_Code/25-11-supply-chain-agent/OR_Agent/examples/H&M_instances/610776002/train.csv
  Samples: [323, 393, 574, 622, 535]
  Mean: 489.4, Count: 5
Promised lead time (used by OR, shown to LLM): 1 periods (1 period = 14 days)
Note: OR uses promised lead time for recommendations. Actual lead times in CSV may differ.
      LLM must infer actual lead time from arrivals and adjust OR recommendations accordingly.

Period 1 (2019-03-18) Hybrid Decision:
============================================================
{
  "rationale": "Date/news: 2019-03-18 (early spring) \u2014 no special events identified that would materially change baseline demand. Inventory snapshot: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Demand/lead-time evidence: historical sample mean = 489.4 units/period, sample std \u2248 126.3; supplier promised LT=1 and no concluded periods to contradict that. OR recommendation: 698 units (capped policy). Interpretation & adjustment: recomputed OR base-stock from history = \u03bc\u0302 + z*\xb7\u03c3\u0302 \u2248 489.4 + 0.43\xb7126.3 \u2248 544 units; OR's higher recommendation appears driven by its cap/variance assumption. Given zero on-hand/pipeline and relatively high holding cost (holding = $1 vs profit = $2), I prefer the statistically justified base-stock to avoid excessive holding cost while maintaining service. Final qty targets the base-stock for LT=1 (order = base_stock \u2212 pipeline \u2248 544). This balances service level implied by z* and holding-cost sensitivity.",
