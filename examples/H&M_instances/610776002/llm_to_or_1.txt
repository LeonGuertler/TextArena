Period 1 (2019-03-18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18, no on-hand or in-transit inventory and no concluded arrivals observed. Historical demands = [323,393,574,622,535] give mean=489.4 and sample std\u2248126.28. There is no evidence of lead-time shifts (no observed arrivals), so use promised LT=1. Use default formulas: mu_hat=(1+L)*mean to cover review+lead demand, sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std to capture variability across the review+lead window. These settings give a base-stock calibrated to historical demand while keeping safety stock moderate given holding cost = $1 and profit = $2.
