{
  "rationale": "a) Date/news context: Period start 2019-03-18 (mid-March). No special holiday/seasonality signals from date that would materially change demand vs historical prior. b) Demand regime: Use provided historical unified samples [323,393,574,622,535] \u2192 sample mean \u2248 489 units per 14-day period. No recent concluded periods to indicate a regime change. c) Lead time / missing orders: Supplier promised LT=1 but there are no past concluded periods showing arrivals, and current on-hand/in-transit are 0, so assume nominal LT=1 for planning (do NOT assume arrivals during this decision). d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, in-transit=0; no overdue or lost orders to account for. e) Final order logic: Holding cost is high ($1/unit/period) relative to profit ($2/unit), so avoid excess inventory. Order approximately the expected period demand to meet sales while minimizing ending inventory. Recommended order = historical mean \u2248 489 units.",
