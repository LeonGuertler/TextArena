Using initial samples from train.csv: /Users/tianyipeng/Documents/Operations_Research_Code/25-11-supply-chain-agent/OR_Agent/examples/H&M_instances/464297007/train.csv
  Samples: [565, 496, 281, 674, 528]
  Mean: 508.8, Count: 5
Promised lead time (shown to LLM): 1 periods (1 period = 14 days)
Note: Actual lead times in CSV may differ and will be inferred by LLM from arrivals.
Set NUM_DAYS to 1 periods based on CSV (limited from 21)

Period 1 (2019-03-18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 decision with on-hand=0 and no in-transit or concluded arrivals. Promised lead time=1 and no historical lead-time observations to contradict it. Demand history shows stable samples [565,496,281,674,528] with no clear changepoint; use full-history defaults. Therefore set L to promised (1). mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) = 2*508.8 = 1017.6 to cover review+lead demand. sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples) = sqrt(2)*143.936 = 203.6 to reflect observed volatility over the review+lead period. These parameters prioritize service (given profit>holding) while the OR backend will cap orders via its cap formula.
