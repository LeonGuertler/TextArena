Period 21 (2019-12-23) Hybrid Decision:
============================================================
{
  "rationale": "Date 2019-12-23 (holiday week approaching). Recent realized demand is high and volatile (Periods 18\u201320 demands: 735, 577, 740) so I expect next-period demand ~650\u2013740. Lead time has been reliably 1 period in recent history (concluded periods show orders from Periods 3\u201320 arriving next period), so the 100 units currently in-transit (ordered in Period 20) should arrive next period. OR baseline recommends 818 (aiming high). I scale that down because: (a) on-hand = 0 but pipeline=100 is imminent; (b) holding cost is high relative to profit (holding $1 vs profit $2) so excess ending inventory penalizes reward; (c) expected demand estimate ~700, so target total supply \u2248 650\u2013700 to avoid heavy overstock. I set order so pipeline + new order \u2248 650 (100 in-transit + 550 ordered = 650). This balances service (likely meet most demand) vs holding cost exposure and corrects OR's higher base-stock given holiday uncertainty.",
  "carry_over_insight": "In-transit 100 units (ordered in Period 20) are expected to arrive with LT=1 (evidence: repeated Period X conclude rows showing prior orders arriving one period later through Period 20).",
  "action": {
    "464297007": 550

Carry-over insight: In-transit 100 units (ordered in Period 20) are expected to arrive with LT=1 (evidence: repeated Period X conclude rows showing prior orders arriving one period later through Period 20).
