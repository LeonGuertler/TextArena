{
  "rationale": "a) Date/context: Period 1 (2019-03-18). No holiday/season signal in mid\u2010March that would materially change demand. b) Demand regime: Historical unified samples for SKU 464297007 = [565,496,281,674,528]; mean \u2248 509 units/14\u2010day period. No evidence yet of a regime shift. c) Lead time: Supplier promised LT=1 but no concluded periods exist to confirm; treat LT=1 as expected but uncertain. d) Inventory & pipeline: On\u2010hand=0, in\u2010transit=0, so no stock will be available for current period demand. e) Order logic: To maximize R = Profit*units_sold \u2212 Holding*ending_inventory, order to cover one period of expected demand (mean \u2248509) so expected sales capture profit while avoiding carrying excess inventory (holding cost = $1/unit/period is high relative to $2 profit). Given LT=1, this order will arrive before Period 2 demand. Order rounded to 509 units.",
