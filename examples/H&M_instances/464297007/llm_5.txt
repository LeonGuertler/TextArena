{
  "rationale": "Date/news: Period 1 is 2019-03-18 (mid\u2010March) \u2014 no major seasonality/holiday impact expected for women's basic underwear. Demand regime: use historical unified samples for SKU 464297007 = [565,496,281,674,528]; sample mean = 509 units/period, moderate variability (min 281, max 674). Lead time: supplier promised LT=1; no concluded periods with arrivals yet to contradict that, so assume LT=1 for now. Inventory & pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=0, so no stock to satisfy Period 1 demand (orders placed now will arrive after this period's decision and only be available for future periods). Forecast & order logic: plan to cover expected next-period demand (~509). Holding cost is high ($1/unit/period) vs profit $2/unit, so avoid large overstock; order close to mean demand to maximize sold units while limiting holding cost. Final action: order 510 units to target expected demand for the upcoming selling period while keeping a small rounding buffer.",
