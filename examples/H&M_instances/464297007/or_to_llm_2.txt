Promised LT=1 and no concluded periods to contradict it, so assume LT=1 for now. OR recommends 746 (base_stock with safety); that is a high safety buffer. Holding cost ($1/unit/period) is 50% of unit profit ($2), so excess inventory is expensive. To balance service level and holding cost, I scale OR down but keep a buffer above the mean to cover variability and lead time: order 600 units (\u2248 mean + ~18% safety).

{
  "rationale": "Date 2019-12-23. Recent concluded periods (14\u201320) show much higher demand (886,458,224,356,735,577,740 \u2192 recent avg \u2248560) vs the earlier downshift noted in Periods 11\u201313; supplier lead time has been reliably 1 (multiple confirmed arrivals t\u2192t+1). OR recommends 818 units (base stock). There is 200 units in-transit (ordered in Period 20) that will arrive next period, so I reduce the order to avoid excess holding cost. Order = OR_base_stock \u2212 pipeline = 818 \u2212 200 = 618 units. This preserves a high service level to meet elevated recent demand while accounting for incoming 200 units to limit holding cost given Profit=$2 and Holding=$1.",
