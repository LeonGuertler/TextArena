  "rationale": "Date: 2019-03-18 (mid-March), no special holiday/seasonality signal. Historical demand samples for SKU 464297007 = [565,496,281,674,528], mean = 508.8 (use as prior for 14-day period demand). On-hand=0, in-transit=0; no concluded arrivals in history to infer actual lead-time yet (supplier promised LT=1). Orders placed this decision will arrive after Period 1 and so will serve Period 2 demand. Balance: expected sales \u2248509 units \xd7 $2 profit = good revenue, but holding cost $1/unit/period is material; order roughly equal to expected period demand to avoid stockouts while limiting holding. Final decision: order 509 units to meet next-period expected demand while monitoring actual arrivals to confirm LT.",
