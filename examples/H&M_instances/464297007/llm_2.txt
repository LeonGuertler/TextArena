{
  "rationale": "Date/context: Period 1 (2019-03-18). No holiday/season signal today. Demand regime: historical unified samples for SKU 464297007 = [565, 496, 281, 674, 528]; mean \u2248 509 units/14-day period, moderate variance (range 281\u2013674). No recent concluded periods to infer actual lead time; supplier promised LT=1 but unverified. Inventory/pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=0, so no stock to meet current-period demand; any order placed now will not be visible as arrived for this decision and likely will first affect next period given sequencing. Forecast & order logic: use historical mean as best estimate for next period demand (\u2248510) and balance profit vs. holding cost: profit per sold unit = $2, holding cost per unsold unit per period = $1. Stocking to ~mean maximizes expected sold units while limiting holding exposure given moderate variance. Final action: order 510 units (to arrive per LT).",
