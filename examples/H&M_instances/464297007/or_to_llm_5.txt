  Samples: [565, 496, 281, 674, 528]
  Mean: 508.8, Count: 5
Promised lead time (used by OR, shown to LLM): 1 periods (1 period = 14 days)
Note: OR uses promised lead time for recommendations. Actual lead times in CSV may differ.
      LLM must infer actual lead time from arrivals and adjust OR recommendations accordingly.

{
  "rationale": "Date 2019-03-18: no obvious seasonal/cultural drivers for this SKU. Historical demand (given samples) \u2192 mean \u2248 508.8 units, std \u2248 143.9. OR recommended 746 (capped policy). OR's base_stock (\u03bc + z\xb7\u03c3 with z\u2248\u03a6\u22121(2/3)\u22480.43) \u2248 571; the OR cap likely pushed the recommendation to 746 by adding extra safety for lead time. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 and promised LT=1 (no concluded periods to contradict), so I prefer the statistically justified base_stock to balance profit ($2) vs holding cost ($1) rather than the higher capped value which increases holding cost risk. Final order set to bring pipeline+on-hand toward \u2248571 to target service while limiting holding cost.",
