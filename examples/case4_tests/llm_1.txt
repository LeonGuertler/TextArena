Historical demand data shows a range between 51 and 124, with an average around 101. However, recent days have shown higher demand spikes. 3) Consider news: There is no news today, but given the high demand on Day 49, it's prudent to assume demand could remain high. 4) Account for lead_time: Since today is the last day, lead_time is irrelevant for future planning. 5) State orders: Since it's the last day and we have no inventory, we should order enough to cover potential high demand.
