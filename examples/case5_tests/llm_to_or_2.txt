Day 1 LLM¡úOR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
On Day 1, we have limited information about actual lead times and no news events affecting demand. The historical demand data shows variability, but no clear trend. Therefore, we will use the default methods for all parameters. This approach is suitable for stable conditions and allows us to adjust as more data becomes available.

Daily Profit: $10.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $10.00

Day 2 LLM¡úOR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
On Day 1, the demand for chips(Regular) was 108 units, but only 5 units were available and sold, resulting in a stockout. The in-transit inventory is 477 units, which were ordered on Day 1 and have not yet arrived. The supplier-promised lead time is 4 days, but we have no arrival data yet to calculate the actual lead time. Given the high demand and stockout situation, it's crucial to ensure sufficient inventory once the current order arrives. The demand pattern from historical data shows variability, so we need to account for this in our demand forecast. Since we are early in the game and have no news events affecting demand, we'll use the default methods for L and mu_hat, and the default method for sigma_hat to capture the overall demand variability.

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Day 3 LLM¡úOR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For chips(Regular), we have no arrivals yet, so we cannot calculate the actual lead time. We will use the supplier-promised lead time of 4 days. The demand has been high, with 108 and 74 units on the first two days, but we have no on-hand inventory and 488 units in transit. To estimate mu_hat, we will use the 'recent_N' method with N=2 to capture the recent high demand trend. For sigma_hat, we will also use 'recent_N' with N=2 to reflect the recent variability in demand.

======================================================================

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Day 4 LLM¡úOR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current situation shows that we have 488 units of chips(Regular) in-transit, with no on-hand inventory. The historical demand data indicates high variability in demand, with recent days showing high demand that was unmet due to lack of inventory. The supplier-promised lead time is 4 days, but we have no actual lead time data yet since no orders have arrived. Given the high demand and the fact that we have a large order in-transit, we should prepare for continued high demand. Therefore, I will use the 'default' method for L, as we have no actual lead time data. For mu_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the recent high demand trend. For sigma_hat, I will also use 'recent_N' with N=3 to reflect the recent variability in demand.

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Day 5 LLM¡úOR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current situation shows that we have 525 units of chips(Regular) in-transit, but none on-hand. The historical demand data indicates high variability in demand, with a recent spike. The supplier-promised lead time is 4 days, but we have not yet observed any arrivals to confirm or adjust this. Given the high demand and zero on-hand inventory, it's crucial to ensure we have enough stock once the in-transit units arrive. Therefore, I will use the default method for lead time, as we have no observed data to calculate it. For mu_hat, I will use the recent_N method with N=5 to capture the recent high demand trend. For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N with N=5 to reflect the recent variability in demand.

Daily Profit: $102.00, Daily Holding Cost: $426.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $-324.00

Day 6 LLM¡úOR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For chips(Regular), the actual lead time observed from the arrival record is 4 days, which matches the supplier-promised lead time. Therefore, we will use the 'default' method for L. The demand pattern shows variability, with a recent drop in demand on Day 5. To capture potential changes in demand trends, we will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat, focusing on the most recent demand data. This approach allows us to react to recent demand fluctuations while still considering a reasonable sample size.

Daily Profit: $134.00, Daily Holding Cost: $370.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $-236.00

Day 7 LLM¡úOR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For chips(Regular), the actual lead time observed from past arrivals is consistently 4 days, matching the supplier-promised lead time. Therefore, we will use the 'default' method for L. The demand pattern shows variability, but no clear trend, so we will use the 'default' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat, which considers all historical data. This approach balances the need to react to demand variability while maintaining stability in our predictions.

Day 8 LLM¡úOR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For chips(Regular), the actual lead time observed from past arrivals is consistently 4 days, matching the supplier-promised lead time. Therefore, we will use the 'default' method for L. The demand pattern shows some variability, but no clear trend, so we will use the 'default' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat, which considers all historical data. This approach balances responsiveness to demand changes with stability, given the current inventory levels and lead time reliability.

Day 9 LLM¡úOR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The lead time for chips(Regular) has consistently been 4 days based on past arrivals, so we will use the 'calculate' method to confirm this. The demand has been fluctuating, but there is no clear trend, so we will use the 'default' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the overall demand pattern. The current inventory is high, with 212 units on-hand and 180 in-transit, so we need to be cautious about over-ordering.

Day 18 LLM¡úOR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical data shows a consistent lead time of 4 days for all orders, so we will use the 'default' method for L. The demand has been fluctuating, but there is no clear trend, so we will use the 'default' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat, which considers the mean and standard deviation of all historical samples. This approach will help us maintain a balance between meeting demand and minimizing holding costs.

Day 19 LLM¡úOR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical data shows a consistent lead time of 4 days for all orders, so we will use the 'default' method for L. The demand has been fluctuating, but there is no clear trend indicating a significant change in demand patterns. Therefore, we will use the 'default' method for mu_hat, which considers the mean of all historical samples. For sigma_hat, we will also use the 'default' method to account for the variability in demand over the entire period. This approach balances the need to react to demand fluctuations while maintaining stability in inventory management.

Day 20 LLM¡úOR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For chips(Regular), the actual lead time has consistently been 4 days, matching the supplier-promised lead time. Therefore, we will use the 'default' method for L. The demand has shown some variability, but there is no clear trend indicating a significant change in demand patterns. Thus, for mu_hat, we will use the 'default' method, which considers the mean of all historical samples. For sigma_hat, we will also use the 'default' method, which calculates the standard deviation based on all historical samples. This approach should provide a balanced estimate of demand and variability over the lead time period.

Day 21 LLM¡úOR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For chips(Regular), the historical data shows a consistent lead time of 4 days, as all arrivals have matched the supplier-promised lead time. Therefore, we will use the 'default' method for L. The demand has been fluctuating, but there is no clear trend indicating a significant change. To capture recent demand patterns while smoothing out short-term fluctuations, we will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=5, which considers the most recent 5 days of demand. For sigma_hat, we will also use 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect the variability in recent demand, ensuring our safety stock accounts for recent fluctuations.

Day 22 LLM¡úOR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For chips(Regular), the historical data shows a consistent lead time of 4 days, as all past arrivals have matched the supplier-promised lead time. Therefore, we will use the 'default' method for L. The demand has been somewhat variable, with recent demands showing a slight increase. To capture this trend, we will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=5, focusing on the most recent demand data. For sigma_hat, we will also use 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect the recent variability in demand.

LLM Rationale:
For chips(Regular), the historical data shows a consistent lead time of 4 days, as all past arrivals have confirmed this lead time. Therefore, we will use the 'default' method for L. The demand has been fluctuating, but there is no clear trend indicating a significant change in demand patterns. Thus, for mu_hat, we will use the 'default' method, which considers the mean of all historical samples.

To capture recent demand patterns while smoothing out short-term fluctuations, we will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=5, which considers the last 5 days of demand. This will help us react to recent changes without overreacting to daily variations.

LLM Rationale:
The historical data shows a consistent lead time of 4 days for all orders, so we will use the 'calculate' method for L, which confirms the supplier-promised lead time. The demand has been relatively stable with some fluctuations, so we will use the 'default' method for mu_hat to capture the overall demand pattern over the lead time period.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For chips(Regular), the actual lead time has consistently been 4 days, matching the supplier-promised lead time. Therefore, we will use the 'default' method for L. The demand has been quite variable, with recent days showing higher demand spikes. To capture this recent trend, we will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat, focusing on the last 5 days to better react to the recent increase in demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $84.00

Day 35 LLM¡úOR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For chips(Regular), the historical data shows a consistent lead time of 4 days, so we will use the 'default' method for L. The demand has been fluctuating, but there is no clear trend indicating a significant change in demand patterns. Therefore, we will use the 'default' method for mu_hat, which considers the mean of all historical samples. For sigma_hat, we will also use the 'default' method to account for the variability in demand over the entire period. This approach balances the need to react to demand fluctuations while maintaining stability in inventory management.

Daily Reward (R_t): $180.00

Day 36 LLM¡úOR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The lead time for chips(Regular) has consistently been 4 days based on historical arrival records, so we will use the 'calculate' method to confirm this. The demand has shown some variability, but there is no clear trend indicating a significant change in demand patterns. Therefore, for mu_hat, we will use the 'default' method, which considers the mean of all historical samples. For sigma_hat, we will also use the 'default' method to account for the variability in demand over the lead time period.

Daily Profit: $256.00, Daily Holding Cost: $116.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $140.00

Day 37 LLM¡úOR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For chips(Regular), the historical data shows a consistent lead time of 4 days, as all past arrivals have matched the supplier-promised lead time. Therefore, we will use the 'default' method for L. The demand has been fluctuating, but there is no clear trend indicating a significant change in demand patterns. Given the stable lead time and fluctuating demand, we will use the 'default' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat, which considers the mean and standard deviation of all historical samples. This approach will help us maintain a balance between meeting demand and minimizing holding costs.

Day 38 LLM¡úOR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For chips(Regular), the historical data shows a consistent lead time of 4 days, as all past arrivals have confirmed this. Therefore, we will use the 'default' method for L. The demand has been somewhat variable, with recent days showing higher demand than earlier in the period. To capture this potential trend, we will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=5, which will focus on the most recent demand data. For sigma_hat, we will also use 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect the recent variability in demand.
