Day 1 LLM¡úOR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
On Day 1, we have limited information about actual lead times and no news events affecting demand. The historical demand data shows variability, but no clear trend. Therefore, we will use the default methods for lead time and demand estimates. This approach is suitable for stable conditions and allows us to adjust as more data becomes available.

Daily Profit: $10.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $10.00

Day 2 LLM¡úOR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
On Day 1, the demand for chips(Regular) was 108 units, but only 5 units were available, resulting in a stockout. The in-transit inventory of 477 units suggests a large order was placed, likely to cover anticipated high demand. The supplier-promised lead time is 4 days, but we have no arrival data yet to infer actual lead time. Given the high demand and stockout, it's crucial to ensure sufficient inventory. We'll use the default lead time as we have no actual data yet. For mu_hat, we'll use the recent_N method with N=1 to react to the high demand observed on Day 1. For sigma_hat, we'll also use recent_N with N=1 to capture the variability based on the latest demand.

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Day 3 LLM¡úOR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For chips(Regular), we have no arrivals yet, so we cannot calculate the actual lead time. We will use the supplier-promised lead time of 4 days. The demand has been high, with 108 and 74 units on the first two days, but we have no on-hand inventory and 540 units in transit. To estimate demand, we will use the 'recent_N' method with N=2 to capture the recent high demand trend. For the standard deviation, we will also use 'recent_N' with N=2 to reflect the variability in recent demand.

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Day 4 LLM¡úOR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current situation shows that we have 540 units of chips(Regular) in-transit, but none on-hand. The demand has been consistently high, with no sales on Days 2 and 3 due to stockouts. The supplier-promised lead time is 4 days, but we have no arrival data yet to calculate the actual lead time. Given the high demand and stockouts, we should prepare for continued high demand. Therefore, I will use the 'default' method for L, as we have no data to calculate actual lead time. For mu_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the recent high demand trend. For sigma_hat, I will also use 'recent_N' with N=3 to reflect the variability in recent demand.

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Day 5 LLM¡úOR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current situation shows that we have 540 units in-transit and no on-hand inventory. The historical demand data indicates high variability in demand, with recent days showing high demand. The supplier-promised lead time is 4 days, but we have no arrival data to infer actual lead time. Given the high demand and no on-hand inventory, we should prepare for potential high sales once the inventory arrives. Therefore, I will use the default method for lead time, recent demand data for mu_hat to capture the recent high demand trend, and the default method for sigma_hat to account for demand variability.

======================================================================

Daily Profit: $102.00, Daily Holding Cost: $426.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $-324.00

Day 6 LLM¡úOR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For chips(Regular), the actual lead time observed from the arrival record is 4 days, which matches the supplier-promised lead time. Therefore, we will use the 'default' method for L. The demand pattern shows variability, with a recent drop in demand on Day 5. To capture recent trends, we will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat, focusing on the last 5 days to account for the latest demand changes. This approach will help us react to any potential shifts in demand while considering the most recent data.

Daily Profit: $134.00, Daily Holding Cost: $422.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $-288.00

Day 7 LLM¡úOR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For chips(Regular), the actual lead time observed from past arrivals is consistently 4 days, matching the supplier-promised lead time. Therefore, we will use the 'default' method for L. The demand pattern shows some variability, but no clear trend, so we will use the 'default' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat, which considers all historical samples. This approach balances the need to react to demand variability while maintaining stability in our predictions.

Day 8 LLM¡úOR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For chips(Regular), the actual lead time observed from past arrivals is consistently 4 days, matching the supplier-promised lead time. Therefore, we will use the 'default' method for L. The demand has been fluctuating, but there is no clear trend, so we will use the 'default' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat, which considers all historical data. This approach will provide a stable estimate of demand and its variability over the lead time period.

Day 9 LLM¡úOR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For chips(Regular), the actual lead time observed from past arrivals is consistently 4 days, matching the supplier-promised lead time. Therefore, we will use the 'default' method for L. The demand has shown some variability, but there is no clear trend indicating a significant change. Given the stable lead time and the absence of news events affecting demand, we will use the 'default' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat, which considers all historical demand data. This approach will help us maintain a balance between meeting demand and minimizing holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $179.00

Day 18 LLM¡úOR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical data shows a consistent lead time of 4 days for all orders, so we will use the 'default' method for L. The demand has been fluctuating, but there is no clear trend, so using the 'default' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat, which considers all historical data, is appropriate. This approach will help us maintain a balance between meeting demand and minimizing holding costs.

Daily Profit: $152.00, Daily Holding Cost: $55.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $97.00

Day 19 LLM¡úOR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical data shows a consistent lead time of 4 days for all past orders, so we will use the 'calculate' method for L, which confirms the supplier-promised lead time. The demand has been fluctuating, but there is no clear trend of increase or decrease, so we will use the 'default' method for mu_hat, which considers the mean of all historical samples. For sigma_hat, we will also use the 'default' method to account for the variability in demand over the entire period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $202.00

Day 20 LLM¡úOR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The lead time for chips(Regular) has consistently been 4 days based on historical arrival records, so we will use the 'calculate' method to confirm this. The demand has shown some variability, but there is no clear trend indicating a significant change in demand patterns. Therefore, for mu_hat, we will use the 'default' method, which considers the mean of all historical samples. For sigma_hat, we will also use the 'default' method to account for the variability in demand over the lead time period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $177.00

Day 21 LLM¡úOR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For chips(Regular), the actual lead time has consistently been 4 days, matching the supplier-promised lead time. Therefore, we will use the 'default' method for L. The demand has shown some variability, but there is no clear trend indicating a significant change in demand patterns. Given the stable lead time and the absence of news events affecting demand, we will use the 'default' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the overall demand variability observed historically.

Day 35 LLM¡úOR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For chips(Regular), the historical data shows a consistent lead time of 4 days, as all past arrivals have confirmed this lead time. Therefore, we will use the 'default' method for L. The demand has been fluctuating, but there is no clear trend indicating a significant change. Given the stable lead time and the absence of any news events affecting demand, we will use the 'default' method for mu_hat, which considers the mean of all historical samples. For sigma_hat, we will also use the 'default' method, as it provides a reliable estimate of demand variability over the lead time period.

Day 36 LLM¡úOR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For chips(Regular), the historical data shows a consistent lead time of 4 days, as all past arrivals have matched the supplier-promised lead time. Therefore, we will use the 'default' method for L. The demand has been relatively stable with some fluctuations, so we will use the 'default' method for mu_hat to capture the overall demand pattern. For sigma_hat, we will also use the 'default' method to account for the variability in demand over the entire historical period.

Daily Profit: $256.00, Daily Holding Cost: $116.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $140.00

Day 37 LLM¡úOR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For chips(Regular), the historical data shows a consistent lead time of 4 days, as all past arrivals have confirmed this lead time. The demand has been fluctuating, with recent days showing higher demand. Given the current on-hand inventory of 116 and in-transit inventory of 272, we need to ensure we have enough stock to meet potential high demand while minimizing holding costs. Therefore, I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time, as it aligns with the observed data. For mu_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the recent increase in demand. For sigma_hat, I will also use 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect the recent variability in demand.

Day 38 LLM¡úOR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For chips(Regular), the historical data shows a consistent lead time of 4 days, so we will use the 'default' method for L. The demand has been fluctuating, but there is no clear trend indicating a significant change. Therefore, for mu_hat, we will use the 'default' method to capture the average demand over the entire historical period. For sigma_hat, we will also use the 'default' method to account for the variability in demand over the same period. This approach balances the need to react to demand fluctuations while maintaining stability in inventory management.
