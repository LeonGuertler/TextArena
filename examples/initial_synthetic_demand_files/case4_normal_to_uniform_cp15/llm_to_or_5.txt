  Samples: [112, 97, 116, 138, 94]
  Mean: 111.4, Count: 5
Promised lead time (shown to LLM): 4 periods (1 period = 14 days)
Note: Actual lead times in CSV may differ and will be inferred by LLM from arrivals.
Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. No concluded arrivals or pipeline; on-hand=0, in-transit=0. No evidence of lead-time deviation or demand regime change from 5 historical samples [112,97,116,138,94]. Use promised lead time and default demand estimates so OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample. This keeps parameters grounded in historical data while covering L+1 periods of demand given zero on-hand/pipeline.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_2: no concluded arrivals beyond Period_1, so no evidence actual lead time differs from promised L=4. On-hand=0, in-transit=141 (ordered Period 1) \u2014 within pipeline. Historical demand samples available and no clear changepoint (past demands: [112,97,116,138,94]; Period 1 demand=107), so use default forecasting formulas. Default L keeps promised lead time; default mu_hat and sigma_hat let the OR engine compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given current information.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
No concluded arrivals have been observed yet for prior orders; insufficient evidence to change lead time, so keep promised lead time. Demand history (112,97,116,138,94) has mean 111.4 \u2014 use full-sample defaults to capture typical demand and variance across the (1+L) review+lead window. This balances service (covering 5 periods of mean demand) against holding cost given profit=2 and holding=1.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_4 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=414. Historical demands = [112,97,116,138,94] (mean=111.4). Orders placed in Periods 1-3 (141,137,136) have no concluded arrivals \u2192 shipments overdue or lost, but actual lead time is unconfirmed (no arrival conclude messages). To avoid overreacting to possible lost shipments and because promised lead time is 4, use default lead time (promised). Use default demand estimates (backend will compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std) so the OR engine applies standard safety stock given promised L=4. This balances service level (covering 5 periods of expected demand) against holding cost while we wait for arrival confirmations.

Carry-over insight: No concluded arrivals for orders placed on Periods 1-3 (ordered=141,137,136; arrived=0) \u2014 suggests shipments are overdue or possibly lost; monitor for future conclude messages to confirm actual lead time.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Observed no concluded arrivals for orders placed in Periods 1\u20134 (ordered totals 141,137,136,135; arrived=0) \u2014 signals shipments are overdue or lost. No reliable concluded lead-time samples to compute an empirical L, so I set L explicitly longer than promised to protect service: L=6. Demand history (past samples provided) shows no clear recent changepoint, so use default demand scaling so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples; volatility likewise use default. These choices hedge against delayed arrivals by increasing cover (larger review+lead demand), while leaving statistical forecasts to the backend.

Daily Profit: $176.00, Daily Holding Cost: $53.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $123.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_6: On-hand=53, in-transit=546. Period_5 conclude shows arrival=141 units (ordered Period 1) with observed lead_time=4 \u2014 this confirms promised lead time of 4 for that shipment. Orders from Periods 2\u20134 remain unconcluded in earlier conclude messages but may still be in-transit or delayed; monitor further concludes. Given one confirmed lead-time=4 and no strong demand regime shift (historical demands: [112,97,116,138,94]), use default methods so the OR backend applies promised L=4 and data-driven demand/volatility ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to balance service level vs holding cost. Defaults keep policy stable while we gather more conclude evidence about other shipments.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods for the shipment ordered on Period 1 (Period_5 conclude: arrived=141, ordered Period 1, lead_time was 4); orders from Periods 2\u20134 remain unconcluded \u2014 continue monitoring for potential lost/delayed shipments.

Daily Reward (R_t): $62.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Context: Period 7. Observed confirmed lead times = 4 periods (Period1 & Period2 concluded at L=4); orders from Periods 3\u20134 remain unconcluded but likely delayed/lost\u2014monitor. Inventory: on-hand=106, in-transit=409 \u2192 ample pipeline covering multiple periods. Decision: use promised/default lead time to keep OR engine aligned with contract L=4 because confirmed arrivals match promised L and remaining in-transit volume is large. Use default demand/volatility (all-sample mean and std scaled by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L)) since no clear recent demand regime shift in the small sample; this keeps base-stock conservative and leverages pipeline to avoid stockouts while limiting holding cost given holding/profit ratio ($2 profit, $1 holding).

Daily Profit: $186.00, Daily Holding Cost: $149.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $37.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_8: on-hand=149, in-transit=281. Historical concluded arrivals show orders placed on Periods 1\u20133 arrived with lead_time=4 (Period_5 concluded arrival for P1, Period_6 for P2, Period_7 for P3). No evidence of a different lead-time regime; shipments that were overdue have since concluded with LT=4. Demand history (samples: [112,97,116,138,94]) shows no strong recent shift. therefore: set L by calculating average observed lead times (reflects confirmed LT=4); use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level (captures observed LT) against holding cost given current ample pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (evidence: Period_5 conclude: arrived=141 ordered P1 lead_time=4; Period_6 conclude: arrived=137 ordered P2 lead_time=4; Period_7 conclude: arrived=136 ordered P3 lead_time=4).

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Period 9. On-hand=147, in-transit=235. Historical demand samples = [112,97,116,138,94]. Multiple concluded arrivals (Periods 5\u20138) show orders placed earlier arrived with lead_time=4 each \u2014 consistent recent evidence of a 4-period actual lead time and no persistent lost-shipment signal for arrivals through Period 8. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the average of observed lead times (reflecting confirmed 4-period actual lead time). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use 'default' so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this leverages full historical demand while the chosen L captures the 4-period pipeline length, balancing service level and holding cost given profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_10: confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods from concluded messages (multiple orders: P1\u2013P5 all showed W=4). On-hand=207, in-transit=235; historical demands = [112,97,116,138,94] show no clear recent demand regime shift. Use promised/default lead time and default demand statistics so backend computes base-stock using full-sample mean/SD scaled by (1+L). This keeps policy consistent with observed L=4 and avoids overfitting to short-term noise while covering (L+1) periods of demand.

LLM Rationale:
Context: Period 11. On-hand=83, in-transit=320. Historical demands = [112,97,116,138,94]. Concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (arrivals in Periods 5\u20139 correspond to orders placed 4 periods earlier), so use promised/default lead time. Using default mu_hat and sigma_hat leverages full-sample demand stats ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to produce a base-stock that balances profit vs holding cost given stable historical demand and confirmed L=4. Current pipeline (320) plus on-hand covers multiple periods of demand; defaults avoid overreacting to single-period order variability while the system continues to monitor any further lost/delayed shipments.

Daily Reward (R_t): $83.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_12: historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4 (multiple concluded messages for orders placed on P1\u2013P5,P7). On-hand=33, in-transit=443 \u2014 substantial pipeline but some earlier orders were delayed then concluded; monitor for any lost shipments (none newly observed). I set L to 'calculate' to reflect the empirically observed average lead time (=4). Demand samples mean=111.4; with L=4 I use the default mu_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean across all samples) to reflect stable historical demand and avoid overreacting to recent variability. I keep sigma_hat as default to let the OR engine use the pooled volatility (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the backend balances service level vs holding cost given observed variability.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained actual lead time = 4 periods (evidence: multiple concluded arrivals showing lead_time=4 for orders placed on Periods 1\u20135 and 7); large pipeline present (in-transit=443) with on-hand=33 \u2014 monitor for lost shipments but no new loss confirmed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $144.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14: demand history = [112,97,116,138,94]; recent concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods and pipeline remains large (on-hand=64, in-transit=351). No new loss signal; shipments that previously arrived confirm L=4. I choose default for L so backend uses promised lead time (4). Use default mu_hat and default sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples \u2014 this leverages full historical demand given no strong recent demand regime shift and large pipeline. This balances service (high pipeline + confirmed L=4) against holding cost by relying on the OR engine's capped ordering policy.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Context: Period 15. On-hand=34, in-transit=371. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead_time = 4 periods (multiple concluded arrivals from P5\u2013P14 confirming L=4). Large pipeline present but no new evidence of lost shipments. Demand history samples = [112,97,116,138,94] (mean=111.4). Decision: use default (promised) lead time and default demand moments so the OR backend uses the stable, confirmed lead-time and full-sample demand statistics to set base-stock. This keeps (1+L)\xd7mean demand forecasting (captures recent realized L=4) and uses full-sample volatility to size safety stock; that balances service (avoid stockouts given large in-transit) against holding cost given high pipeline and modest on-hand.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_16: on-hand=47, in-transit=359. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple concluded arrivals with lead_time=4). Recent demand samples [112,97,116,138,94] show no clear regime shift. To keep decisions aligned with observed delivery behavior and stable demand, use default lead time (promised=4) and default demand/volatility calculations so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service level (use observed L=4) against holding cost given current sizeable pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $90.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_17: confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple concluded arrivals through Period_16 show lead_time=4). On-hand=32, in-transit=435 \u2192 large pipeline available; no immediate replenishment needed. Use default lead time to match promised (and confirmed) L=4. Demand history samples are limited but no strong recent shift detected, so use default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) to let OR backend compute base-stock while keeping forecast anchored to historical variability. This keeps orders moderate given high pipeline, reducing holding cost risk while maintaining service given profit/holding tradeoff.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained actual lead time = 4 periods through Period_16 (multiple concluded arrivals showing lead_time=4); large pipeline present (in-transit=435) with low on-hand (32) \u2014 monitor but no new loss confirmed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-103.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 18. Evidence: concluded arrivals through Period 17 consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods. On-hand = 115, in-transit = 399; pipeline is large so no immediate emergency. Demand history seed (provided samples) used for baseline forecasting. Choose L default to use promised lead time (promised=4, matches observed). Use mu_hat default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) \u2014 conservative baseline given stable lead time and no calendar shocks. Use sigma_hat default so backend computes sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) to reflect historical variability. These settings balance service (use historic mean over lead+review) vs holding cost given large pipeline and confirmed lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $41.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_19: historical demand samples stable (past demands [112,97,116,138,94], mean=111.4). Concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods through Period_18 (multiple concluded arrivals with lead_time=4). Current inventory: on-hand=133, in-transit=294 (large pipeline). No new loss evidence; regime appears stable so use defaults tied to full-sample stats. Using default L, mu_hat, sigma_hat lets the OR engine compute (1+L)-period demand mean and volatility from all samples, providing a balanced base-stock that captures observed lead time and demand variability while letting the backend trade service level vs holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Sustained actual lead time = 4 periods confirmed through Period_18 (multiple concluded arrivals); large pipeline present (in-transit=294) with on-hand=133 \u2014 monitor for lost shipments but no new loss confirmed.

LLM Rationale:
Current period: Period_22. Profit=$2, Holding=$1. On-hand=131, In-transit=188. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple concluded arrivals from Periods 5\u201321 with lead_time=4) and no new lost-shipment signal. Demand history samples: [112,97,116,138,94] show no recent structural shift. I therefore use the promised/default lead time and default demand moments so the OR engine applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples. This keeps the backend anchored to the observed stable LT=4 regime and historical demand, balancing service-level (by covering L+1 periods) against holding cost given moderate on-hand and a sizable pipeline.

Current stock: on-hand=125, in-transit=308 \u2192 pipeline+on-hand=433, which is below the (1+L)-period demand implied by historical mean (~557), so we are underpiped by ~124 units. Use promised/default lead time to align with observed stable L=4. Use default demand/volatility calculations so the OR backend computes base_stock using full-sample mean and std (conservative given no strong recent demand shift). This balances service level (cover L+1 periods) against holding cost given steady lead-time evidence.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_27: sustained actual lead time = 4 periods (concluded arrivals consistently show W=4). On-hand=163, in-transit=182 \u2014 pipeline + on-hand adequate but not excessive given demand variability. No strong evidence of recent demand regime shift from provided historical samples. Use promised/default lead time so OR backend leverages known L=4; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) to keep estimates stable and avoid overreacting to transient fluctuations. This balances service level (profit > holding cost) while limiting holding cost given current healthy on-hand + pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $92.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_28: confirmed sustained actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple concluded arrivals showing lead_time=4 through Period_27). Current inventory: on-hand=130, in-transit=244. Historical demand samples (seed) = [112,97,116,138,94] => mean ~111.4. No clear recent demand regime shift; use default methods so OR backend applies promised lead time and full-sample demand stats. Using defaults keeps (1+L) safety cover for the 5-period review+lead horizon and leverages historical mean/variance to balance $2 profit vs $1 holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Sustained actual lead time = 4 periods confirmed through Period_27 (multiple concluded arrivals with lead_time=4); pipeline remains large (in-transit=244) with on-hand=130 \u2014 monitor but no new lost shipments confirmed.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 29: on-hand=0, in-transit=356. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple arrivals with lead_time=4). Demand history (samples provided) shows moderate, variable demand. Pipeline (356) plus expected arrival cadence should cover upcoming demand but on-hand is zero so we must rely on in-transit. I therefore keep L at the promised/default (4) since concluded arrivals confirm that regime. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this balances service level against holding cost given stable lead-time evidence and existing large pipeline.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period_30: on-hand=0, in-transit=450; historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead_time=4. Demand context: no new calendar/news signals; use default/statistics so OR backend applies promised lead time and the sample-based forecast. Large pipeline (450) already covers multiple (L+1) periods of expected demand, so rely on default L and default demand moments to avoid overreacting to transient variability while letting the OR cap/order logic throttle new orders.

Use L=default (promised lead time = 4) to match observed sustained lead time. Use mu_hat=default to rely on the full-sample mean scaled by (1+L) to cover review+lead demand given large pipeline and zero on-hand. Use sigma_hat=default so backend estimates volatility from all samples; this balances service level vs holding cost given profit=2 and holding=1.

Current period: Period_33. Confirmed sustained actual lead time = 4 periods from concluded history (multiple concluded arrivals with lead_time=4). Inventory: on-hand=80, in-transit=400 (large pipeline). Demand history seed available (initial samples). Given confirmed lead time and large pipeline, use promised/default lead time so backend aligns with observed regime. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from available demand samples; this balances service level (profit $2 vs holding $1) without over-adjusting from limited sample set. Parameters aim to cover (L+1) periods of demand while avoiding excess explicit inflation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-208.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_34: demand context unchanged from historical samples; recent conclude messages through Period_33 consistently show arrived orders with lead_time=4, and current on-hand=218 with in-transit=283. No evidence of new lost shipments. Given sustained actual lead time=4 and no clear demand regime shift, use default lead time (promised=4) and default demand estimates to let OR backend compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from historical samples. This balances service level (accounting for L+1 review horizon) against holding cost without overreacting to noise.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained actual lead time = 4 periods through Period_33 (multiple concluded arrivals showing lead_time=4); current pipeline in-transit=283 with on-hand=218 \u2014 no new lost shipments confirmed.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35: on-hand=255, in-transit=228. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple conclude messages through Period_34). Demand history shows no clear recent regime shift vs. prior samples. Given confirmed LT=4 and stable demand, use promised/default lead time and default demand/volatility calculations so OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of the sample set; this balances service level (respecting observed 4-period LT) against holding cost with no aggressive up- or down-weighting.

Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple concluded arrivals with lead_time=4 through Period 37) \u2014 no evidence of lost shipments recently. Demand seed samples (provided) = [112,97,116,138,94]. I choose L via 'calculate' to let backend use observed lead times (avg=4) to reflect sustained LT=4. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I select 'default' so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing a stable base-stock that balances service level and holding cost given steady demand signal and confirmed 4-period lead time. This keeps orders sized to cover the (L+1) review+lead period while avoiding unnecessary inventory growth given current sizable pipeline.

Recent demand history (seed samples provided) will be used as baseline; no clear regime shift or seasonality signal requiring deviation. Reconcile: on-hand + in-transit (459) comfortably covers multiple periods of demand, so use default lead time and default demand/volatility estimates to let OR backend compute base-stock while capping orders. This balances service level (maintain high fill given large pipeline) against holding cost by not inflating forecasts.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 41: on-hand=102, in-transit=242. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (sustained through Period 40). Pipeline is large but not indicating new losses. I use default lead time (promised=4) and default demand/volatility calculations so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7historical mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7historical std across all samples\u2014this leverages full historical demand and the confirmed L=4 to balance service level vs holding cost given the current sizable pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $73.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_42: on-hand=105, in-transit=294. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods through Period_41 (multiple concluded arrivals with lead_time=4). Pipeline is sizable relative to on-hand; no evidence of new lost shipments. Use promised/default lead time to keep OR engine aligned with observed regime. Use default demand/volatility (all-sample mean/std scaled by 1+L and sqrt(1+L)) since recent demand samples (history) show no abrupt mean shift beyond normal variability and pipeline is large enough to cover forecast uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained actual lead time = 4 periods through Period_41 (multiple concluded arrivals showing lead_time=4); pipeline large (in-transit=294) with on-hand=105 \u2014 continue monitoring for lost shipments.

Daily Reward (R_t): $98.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods. Current on-hand=54 and large in-transit=358 (much pipeline arriving), so avoid aggressive replenishment to limit holding costs. Set L to be inferred from observed lead times (calculate). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from historical demand samples; this balances service level while letting the engine cap orders given the large pipeline.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period_44 snapshot: on-hand=95, in-transit=331. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple concluded arrivals across history), and pipeline remains large but no new lost shipments confirmed. I choose to trust the promised/observed lead time and use default demand estimates to let the OR backend compute base-stock with the standard (1+L) scaling\u2014this balances service level (using observed L=4) against holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period_45: on-hand=0, in-transit=364. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods; no new lost shipments confirmed. Pipeline (364) is large relative to on-hand=0 so we remain with promised lead time. Set L to default (promised) since concluded history aligns with 4 and backend expects promised L. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7sample mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the provided demand samples; this keeps forecasting anchored to the observed demand sample set while the large pipeline mitigates short-term stockout risk and avoids excess explicit increases that raise holding cost.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_46: on-hand=72, in-transit=343. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple concluded arrivals from Period_5 through Period_45 with lead_time=4). Demand samples [112,97,116,138,94] seed forecasts; no calendar/news signals provided. Given stable observed lead time and no clear demand regime shift, use default lead time (promised=4) and default demand/volatility calculations so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This keeps policy aligned with observed LT=4, leverages full-sample demand stats to balance service level vs holding cost, and avoids overreacting to short-term inventory fluctuations or pipeline size.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 47. Historical concludes confirm sustained actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple concluded arrivals with lead_time=4). Inventory: on-hand=143, in-transit=323 \u2014 large pipeline available but on-hand moderate. Use default lead time (promised=4) because concluded history matches promised. Use default demand estimates (no clear recent demand regime shift beyond historical samples provided). These settings keep OR backend's base-stock anchored to the full-sample mean/variance while letting the capped order limit control order size given the large pipeline, balancing service level vs holding cost.

Use promised/confirmed L=4 (default) and default demand stats based on all historical samples to let OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std from full demand history; this balances service (profit $2 vs holding $1) using standard base-stock sizing given stable demand evidence.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
History shows sustained actual lead time = 4 periods (many concluded arrivals with lead_time=4). Current inventory: on-hand=58, in-transit=223 (total pipeline=281) which is ~2.5\xd7 recent mean demand \u2014 short of the (L+1)=5 periods coverage target. Use default demand stats from full sample history to let OR backend compute base_stock and cap given promised lead time=4; this is conservative because lead time has been stable and historical samples (mean ~111.4) are trustworthy. Defaults balance service level vs holding cost while avoiding overreacting to recent pipeline noise or transient spikes.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 50: observed sustained actual lead time = 4 periods in concluded history. On-hand=0, in-transit=262 \u2014 large pipeline but no new confirmed lost shipments. Demand context: historical sample set provided (chips regular). To balance service level vs holding cost, use default lead time (promised 4, confirmed by concludes) and default demand estimates so OR backend applies overall-sample mean and std across (1+L) review+lead period. This keeps orders aligned with long-run demand signal while avoiding aggressive increases to inventory given holding cost = $1/unit and profit = $2/unit.
