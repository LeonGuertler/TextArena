OR recommended 150 (capped baseline) but that policy uses promised L and historical mean only and can over-order when pipeline is already large. Risk trade-off: Profit per unit $4 vs holding $1 means moderate risk tolerance (fractile 0.8), but holding cost accumulates each period and we already have large pipeline. Coverage check: if single-period demand \u2248111, 332 covers ~3.0 periods (<L+1=5). If demand \u224874 (recent), 332 covers ~4.5 periods (\u2248L+1).

Demand assessment: long-run sample mean \u2248111.4 and sample sd \u224817.6, but recent history shows large spikes (Periods 48\u201349 demand 192 and 182) and several earlier low periods \u2014 volatility is high.

Reason: OR\u2019s capped policy already tempers the large base-stock suggestion while accounting for multi-period demand; given confirmed 4-period lead time, high recent demand spikes, and acceptable profit/holding tradeoff, ordering 166 balances service and holding cost.
