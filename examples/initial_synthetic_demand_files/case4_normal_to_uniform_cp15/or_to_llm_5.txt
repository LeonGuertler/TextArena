{
  "rationale": "Lead-time & pipeline: Concluded history shows actual lead time \u22481 period for confirmed arrivals, but many orders since Period 2 remained unconcluded for long periods and are treated as unreliable; therefore do NOT count in-transit 1164 toward coverage. Inventory & demand: Empirical mean demand \u2248111.4 units/period. Current on-hand=534 \u2192 covers ~4.8 periods of demand (534/111.4). Cost tradeoff: Profit per unit=$2, holding cost=$1/period \u2192 critical fractile favors some safety stock, but with on-hand >> (1+L)\xd7mean there's no need to order. OR recommended 0; given unreliable pipeline and high on-hand (which avoids stockouts) placing orders would increase holding cost and reduce reward.
