Target pipeline to cover (L+1) periods \u2248 488; current pipeline (on-hand+in-transit)=180, shortfall \u2248 308. OR recommended 166 (uses long-run historic mean and promised L); given confirmed L=4 and recent high sales (two large spikes) I need to replenish to avoid stockouts and lost sales. Tradeoff vs holding cost: holding cost is $1/unit/period and profit $2/unit; to balance, I order slightly below the exact shortfall to limit excess inventory. Final action: order 300 units (\u2248308 shortfall rounded down modestly) to bring pipeline closer to cover next 5 periods while limiting holding exposure.",
