Carry-over insight from prior periods indicates a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 27 with recent avg \u2248129 for that regime. Recent periods show large spikes (Periods 48\u201349 demand 192 and 182) that create downside risk of stockouts if we under-order. Cost trade-offs: profit per unit=$4, holding cost=$1 \u2192 critical fractile q=4/5=0.8 (z\u22480.84) which favors stocking to meet demand but holding cost is non-trivial. With lead time = 0, there is no pipeline uncertainty; we can safely order to meet expected single-period demand. Given on-hand=0 and evidence of elevated demand regime and very large recent spikes, I will accept the OR capped recommendation of 129 units to balance stockout risk against holding cost. This follows OR\u2019s data-driven cap while respecting confirmed lead time and recent high-demand evidence.",
