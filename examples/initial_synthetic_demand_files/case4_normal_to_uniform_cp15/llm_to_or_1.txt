Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
No concluded arrivals yet; on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Use promised lead time and historical demand samples (5 observations) to initialize base-stock calculations. No evidence of changepoints or lost shipments. Choosing default lead time so OR backend uses promised L=4; using default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) to balance service level vs holding cost given current lack of signals.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_2: No concluded arrivals yet beyond Period_1 (Period_1 conclude shows ordered=141, arrived=0) so do not infer lead-time change. On-hand=0, in-transit=141 (order placed Period_1) \u2014 expect arrivals per promised lead time. Use promised lead time and default demand estimates based on all historical samples [112,97,116,138,94] to let OR backend compute base stock and cap automatically. This balances service level (cover L+1 periods) while avoiding premature changes from a single non-concluded arrival.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=278 (orders from P1,P2). No concluded arrivals yet; orders placed in Periods 1 and 2 still show arrived=0 in their conclude messages, so we have evidence of delayed arrivals but not enough concluded arrivals to re-estimate lead time. Demand history (samples) = [112,97,116,138,94], mean=111.4. Use promised lead time (default L=4) to remain consistent with OR engine assumptions and avoid prematurely treating shipments as lost. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level (covers L+1 periods) against holding cost given current uncertainty and overdue shipments.

Carry-over insight: Orders placed in Periods 1 and 2 have not concluded (arrived=0); possible lead-time delay or lost shipments\u2014monitor for concludes before revising lead-time estimate.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
No concluded arrivals yet for any orders; in-transit=414 equals orders placed in Periods 1\u20133. Promised lead time (4) remains consistent with observed concludes (no early arrivals), so keep L at default. Use default demand estimates (all-sample mean and std scaled by 1+L) because recent demand shows no clear regime shift and sample size is small. This keeps base-stock anchored to historical mean (balances service vs holding given profit=2, holding=1).

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Period 5. On-hand=0, in-transit=549. Historical demand samples: [112,97,116,138,94]. Orders placed in Periods 1\u20134 have not concluded => possible extended lead time or lost shipments, but no concluded arrivals exist to compute actual lead time per rules. I therefore keep L as default (promised=4) because only concluded arrivals can justify changing L. Using default mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, which balances service level against holding cost given the available demand history. This choice also avoids overreacting to potentially lost shipments until concludes confirm a lead-time regime change. I will monitor conclude messages for evidence before revising parameters.

Daily Reward (R_t): $123.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_6: confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (Period 1 order arrived in Period 5 with lead_time=4). Current inventory: on-hand=53, in-transit=408. Historical demand samples = [112,97,116,138,94] (mean=111.4). No clear demand regime shift or seasonality signal in provided dates; missing arrivals from Periods 2-4 are currently in-transit (not lost). Given confirmed lead time matches promised, use default lead time to keep OR engine assumptions aligned. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample set, preserving historical variability while covering (L+1) periods of demand and avoiding overreaction to recent in-transit noise. This balances service level (profit>holding cost) against holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods based on Period 1 order arrival in Period 5 (ordered on Period 1, lead_time was 4); earlier apparent delays are resolved as in-transit rather than lost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $62.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_7: On-hand=106, in-transit=342. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (Period 1 order arrived in Period 5, Period 2 order arrived in Period 6). Demand history (samples [112,97,116,138,94]) shows no strong recent regime shift; no calendar/news signals provided. I will use a lead-time estimate based on observed lead times and default demand estimates to let the OR backend compute base-stock and caps using full-sample mean/variance. This keeps service level aligned with observed L=4 while avoiding overreacting to earlier transient non-concludes.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (Period 1 order arrival in Period 5; Period 2 arrival in Period 6).

Daily Reward (R_t): $37.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 8. Demand history shows mean \u2248111.4 (samples: [112,97,116,138,94]). Recent conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (Period1\u2192arrived in P5, Period2\u2192P6, Period3\u2192P7). On-hand=149, in-transit=281 (pipeline=430). Pipeline + on-hand (430) is below (1+L)*mean (5*111.4\u2248557), so we remain cautious but rely on historical stats and confirmed lead time. Using default methods (promised lead time and overall-sample demand/volatility) lets the OR engine compute base_stock and cap with full-sample mean/std while preserving service-level tradeoff given holding cost/profit.

Daily Reward (R_t): $127.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9: on-hand=147, in-transit=235; recent concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 (Period1\u2192arrived Period5, Period2\u2192arrived Period6, Period3\u2192arrived Period7, Period4\u2192arrived Period8). Historical demand samples = [112,97,116,138,94], mean\u2248111.4. No clear demand regime shift or seasonality signal; prior apparent delays were in-transit and not lost. I therefore keep L at the promised/default (4) to match observed actual lead time, and use default demand statistics so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample set. This balances service (covering L+1 periods) against holding cost given ample pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained actual lead time = 4 periods based on multiple concluded arrivals (Period1\u21925, Period2\u21926, Period3\u21927, Period4\u21928); earlier missing concludes were in-transit rather than lost.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10: confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple concluded arrivals: Period1\u21925, Period2\u21926, Period3\u21927, Period4\u21928). On-hand=69, In-transit=373 \u2192 total pipeline=442, which comfortably covers (1+L)=5 periods at the observed sample mean (mean demand \u2248111.4). No new lost shipments detected; use default calculations so OR backend applies promised lead time and full-sample demand stats. This balances service (use L=promised) with holding cost by relying on data-driven base-stock and volatility estimates rather than manual overrides.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:

No evidence of lost shipments now \u2014 earlier missing concludes resolved as in-transit. Decision: keep L at promised lead time to match observed actual lead time and avoid overreacting. Use default demand/volatility estimators ((1+L)\xd7mean, sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) because recent concluded demand pattern aligns with historical samples and there is no clear regime shift; large in-transit pipeline already covers multiple periods of demand so conservative default settings balance service level vs holding cost.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12: historical concludes consistently confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple orders: P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7, P4\u2192P8, P6\u2192P10, P7\u2192P11). On-hand = 33, in-transit = 443 \u2014 pipeline is large and recent arrivals show earlier delays were in-transit, not lost. Use promised/default lead time to match observed pattern. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat to default so backend uses full-sample mean/variance scaled by (1+L); this keeps the base-stock anchored to long-run demand (samples: [112,97,116,138,94]) while the OR cap limits per-period ordering risk given the large current pipeline, balancing service level vs holding cost.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_13 context: chips(Regular) has on-hand=30, in-transit=400, profit=$2, holding=$1. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (Period1\u21925, P2\u21926, P3\u21927, P4\u21928, P6\u219210, P7\u219211, P8\u219212). No evidence of lost shipments; pipeline is large vs on-hand. Use default lead time (promised) since concluded history confirms L=4. Use default demand estimates (no strong recent mean/variance shift signaled relative to provided sample set), letting OR backend compute base-stock from full-sample mean and std. This keeps parameters stable while OR handles safety-stock/service tradeoff given profit vs holding cost.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_14: on-hand=64, in-transit=351. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple concluded arrivals: Period1\u21925, 2\u21926, 3\u21927, 4\u21928, 6\u219210, 7\u219211, 8\u219212, 9\u219213). I set L to 'calculate' to let backend use observed lead times (avg=4). Demand stats are sparse but stable; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, ensuring the base-stock covers the review+lead horizon while the cap limits order size to control holding cost versus service level.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

On-hand=34, in-transit=371 -> large pipeline (covers multiple L+1 demands). Use promised/default lead time and demand estimates derived from full historical sample to keep OR engine aligned with observed stable lead time and aggregate demand (sum of samples = (1+L)\xd7mean). This avoids overreacting to earlier transient missing-conclude events and balances service level vs holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:

Daily Reward (R_t): $90.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Inventory: on-hand=32, in-transit=435. Historical demand samples = [112,97,116,138,94]. Multiple concluded arrivals across periods confirm actual lead time = 4 (Period1\u21925, Period2\u21926, Period3\u21927, Period4\u21928, Period6\u219210, Period7\u219211, Period8\u219212, Period9\u219213, Period10\u219214, Period11\u219215, Period12\u219216). No recent evidence of lost shipments. Use L=default to trust the sustained 4-period lead time signal. Use mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so backend computes (1+L)-period demand mean and scaled std from all samples; this balances service level vs holding cost given stable demand sample set and confirmed lead time.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained actual lead time = 4 periods based on concluded arrivals: Period1\u21925, Period2\u21926, Period3\u21927, Period4\u21928, Period6\u219210, Period7\u219211, Period8\u219212, Period9\u219213, Period10\u219214, Period11\u219215, Period12\u219216.

Given clear evidence of stable lead time and no recent demand regime shift, use default methods so OR backend uses promised L=4 and full-sample demand statistics ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This balances service (coverage over L+1 periods) against holding cost while relying on observed stable lead time.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Confirmed sustained actual lead time = 4 periods from multiple concluded arrivals. Recent inventory: on-hand=209, in-transit=251 (total pipeline+on-hand=460) which is below the (1+L)-period demand implied by historical mean (\u2248557), so we should target replenishment consistent with historical demand and the promised lead time. Use default statistics (trusted historical samples) so the OR backend computes base_stock = (1+L)*mean and volatility from all samples; this balances service level and holding cost given stable lead time.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Inventory high (on-hand=249, in-transit=162). Historical demand samples for forecasting: [112,97,116,138,94]. Concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple period mappings confirmed); no evidence of lost shipments. To keep OR backend aligned with observed behavior while avoiding overfitting to short-term demand noise, use default methods: L=default (promised lead time 4), mu_hat=default ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and sigma_hat=default (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples). This provides a stable base-stock driven by full-sample mean/variance and keeps pipeline + on-hand targeted to cover (L+1) periods of demand, balancing service level (profit $2 vs holding $1) against holding cost given current ample inventory.

LLM Rationale:
Period_22: on-hand=131, in-transit=188. Historical concludes consistently confirm actual lead time = 4 periods. No new lost shipments or demand regime shifts detected; recent on-hand is healthy relative to in-transit. Use default (promised) lead time and default demand/volatility (all-sample mean/std scaled by 1+L) so OR backend applies its calibrated base-stock policy while preserving service with current pipeline.

Multiple concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (Period1\u21925, Period2\u21926, Period3\u21927, Period4\u21928, Period6\u219210, Period7\u219211, Period8\u219212, Period9\u219213, Period10\u219214, Period11\u219215, Period12\u219216). No evidence of ongoing lost shipments. Use default lead time (promised=4) and default demand moments so OR backend computes base-stock from full-sample mean/SD scaled by (1+L). This keeps policy aligned with confirmed LT and uses all available demand samples to balance service level vs holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Actual lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods by multiple concluded arrivals (e.g., Period1\u21925, Period2\u21926, Period3\u21927, Period4\u21928, Period6\u219210, Period7\u219211, Period8\u219212, Period9\u219213, Period10\u219214, Period11\u219215, Period12\u219216, Period19\u219223). On-hand = 148 and in-transit = 340 provide ample coverage; use default lead time to match promised/observed L=4. Demand history mean is ~111.4; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR engine balances service level vs holding cost using the observed demand stats and the confirmed lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-13.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 25. On-hand=125, in-transit=308. Historical conclude messages repeatedly confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple arrivals show ordered\u2192arrived with W=4). No new evidence of lost shipments. Demand history (seed samples) = [112,97,116,138,94], mean=111.4, std\u224815.74. I use promised/confirmed lead time (default L=4) to keep pipeline coverage aligned with observed arrivals. mu_hat default uses (1+L)*mean = 5\xd7111.4 to match average demand over review+lead period; sigma_hat default uses sqrt(1+L)\xd7std = sqrt(5)\xd715.74 to reflect aggregated variability. These conservative defaults keep service level target consistent with profit/holding tradeoff while avoiding overreaction to short-term fluctuations or in-transit noise.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-27.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
On-hand=145, in-transit=278. Historical demand samples = [112,97,116,138,94] (mean=111.4). Multiple concluded arrivals across periods confirm sustained actual lead time = 4 periods. To keep OR engine aligned with promised behavior and ample pipeline, use default lead time (promised=4) and default demand/volatility calculations ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so backend computes mu_hat and sigma_hat from full sample set. This balances service (high pipeline + base-stock) against holding costs given current high on-hand and in-transit.

Carry-over insight: Sustained actual lead time = 4 periods confirmed by multiple concluded arrivals (Period1\u21925, Period2\u21926, Period3\u21927, Period4\u21928, Period6\u219210, Period7\u219211, Period8\u219212, Period9\u219213, Period10\u219214, Period11\u219215, Period12\u219216).

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 27: on-hand=163, in-transit=182. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple arrivals: Period1\u21925, Period2\u21926, etc.), so no change to promised lead time. Demand history (samples: [112,97,116,138,94]) shows mean ~111.4; using default methods keeps OR engine's (1+L) scaling and variance treatment consistent with historical data and the backend's assumptions. Default L preserves promised lead time; default mu_hat and sigma_hat let the OR engine compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given stable lead time and demand evidence.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period: Period_28. Historical concludes consistently confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple arrivals mapping ordered Period t \u2192 arrived Period t+4). On-hand = 130, in-transit = 244 \u2014 pipeline is healthy. Demand history (samples) shows stable mean/variance; no recent changepoint. Use promised/default lead time and default demand estimators so OR backend uses full-history mean and std scaled by (1+L). This keeps service high given profit>holding cost while avoiding unnecessary explicit increases to mu/sigma that would raise holding costs.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Context: Period 29. On-hand=0, in-transit=356. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods. Recent demand has increased (Periods 26-28: 132, 111, 157) vs earlier periods, so I bias forecasts toward the most recent regime. L: keep promised/default lead time (4) because multiple concluded arrivals confirm sustained L=4. mu_hat: use recent_N (N=5) to capture the recent higher-demand regime and avoid diluting with older low-demand data; this sets the OR engine's review+lead demand forecast to respond to current elevated demand. sigma_hat: use recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility in demand spikes and ensure safety stock responds to recent variability. These settings keep pipeline coverage aligned with confirmed lead time and raise target base-stock and cap to reduce stockouts while accepting moderate holding costs given higher demand.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=484. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods. Demand context: recent game history shows varied demand but no clear persistent regime shift. I therefore keep L at the promised/default to reflect confirmed lead time and use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7sample mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7sample std from all available demand samples. This balances service level (use confirmed L=4) with holding cost by letting the OR engine set base stock from full-sample stats; current large pipeline will reduce new order size via the pipeline cap.

Demand history is variable with intermittent stockouts (recent periods 28\u201330 had stockouts). I will use the promised/default lead time so the OR engine uses L=4, and use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples\u2014this leverages the full sample set while the large in-transit pipeline prevents aggressive new ordering and balances service level vs holding cost.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 32: chips(Regular) profit $2, holding $1. On-hand=0, in-transit=363. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple Period X\u2192X+4 confirms). Demand seed samples = [112,97,116,138,94] (mean=111.4). I keep L=promised (default) because concluded history confirms sustained lead time=4 and no new anomalies. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the seed samples; this gives a demand target that covers the review+lead horizon and raises orders because current pipeline (363) is below the (1+L)\xd7mean demand (~557). This balances service level (avoid stockouts given confirmed L=4) against holding cost by letting the OR engine compute the z-based safety stock and apply its cap.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-14.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33: demand history unchanged (samples: [112,97,116,138,94]); current on-hand=80, in-transit=400. Concluded arrivals across many periods consistently show actual lead time = 4 (arrivals for orders placed in Period t occurred in Period t+4 through recent history). I therefore use the default lead-time and default demand aggregation so the OR backend (which assumes promised L=4) computes mu_hat=(1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples). This is conservative and aligns on-hand + pipeline coverage for the (L+1) demand periods while avoiding overreacting to noise or transient variation.

Carry-over insight: Sustained actual lead time = 4 periods confirmed by concluded arrivals through recent history (e.g., orders placed in Periods 28\u2192arrived Period32, 27\u219231, 26\u219230, 25\u219229, 24\u219228).

Demand history is variable; no clear recent regime shift requiring adjustment. To keep policy aligned with confirmed lead time and historical stats, use default lead time and default demand moments so the OR backend computes base_stock from overall sample mean/std scaled by (1+L).

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 36. Historical concludes consistently confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (many orders: Period1\u21925,2\u21926,3\u21927,4\u21928,...,29\u219233). On-hand=163, in-transit=181 gives healthy coverage. No recent demand regime shift detected; use promised/confirmed L=4 and default demand estimates so OR backend uses full-sample mean/SD scaled by (1+L). This balances service (maintain stock for 4-period lead) while avoiding aggressive overstock given holding cost = $1 and profit = $2.

Carry-over insight: Sustained actual lead time = 4 periods confirmed by repeated concluded arrivals (e.g., Period1\u21925, Period2\u21926, Period3\u21927, Period4\u21928, Period6\u219210, Period7\u219211, Period8\u219212, Period9\u219213, Period10\u219214, Period11\u219215, Period12\u219216, Period24\u219228, Period25\u219229, Period26\u219230, Period27\u219231, Period28\u219232, Period29\u219233).

Historical sample mean = 111.4 (from provided samples), so target demand over review+lead (1+L)=5 periods \u2248 557; current pipeline < target so backend should replenish. Given confirmed LT=4, I use default lead time to match promised LT and use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this lets the OR optimizer set base-stock balancing profit ($2) vs holding ($1) per instructions.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_39. Historical sample mean ~111.4 (from provided past demands [112,97,116,138,94]). Recent concludes confirm sustained actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple orders: e.g., Period1\u21925, Period2\u21926, ... Period33\u219237). Current inventory: on-hand=115, in-transit=273 \u2014 ample pipeline. Use default lead time to match confirmed L=4 and default demand moments to let OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample, keeping parameters stable and avoiding overreaction to short-term noise. This balances service level (profit>holding cost) while limiting excess holding given already-large pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-30.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current status: Period 40. On-hand=90, In-transit=369. Historical concluded arrivals consistently indicate actual lead time = 4 periods. Demand context: SKU is chips(Regular); available demand samples used by backend are the provided history. Pipeline (on-hand + in-transit = 459) comfortably covers (1+L) periods of demand under L=4, so no explicit correction needed. Decision: use default lead time and default demand moments so OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This keeps parameters aligned with sustained observed lead time, avoids overreacting to transient noise, and balances service level vs holding cost given current ample pipeline.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_41: historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods. Current on-hand=102, in-transit=242. Past demand samples = [112,97,116,138,94] (mean ~111.4). Given sustained L=4 and no recent regime change in demand, use default calculations so backend applies (1+L)\xd7sample mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This keeps parameters aligned with observed lead time, avoids overreacting to single-period variability, and lets OR backend balance service level vs holding cost using its calibrated z* and cap. In-transit + on-hand provides coverage for upcoming periods; using defaults keeps orders smooth and prevents overstock from ad-hoc forecasting.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 42. Inventory: on-hand=105, in-transit=294. Historical conclude messages consistently confirm actual lead time = 4 periods. Demand history shows no clear recent regime shift. To keep parameters aligned with confirmed lead time and the OR engine's defaults, use default lead time and default demand moments so backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances service level (use confirmed L=4) versus holding cost given on-hand + sizable pipeline.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43: on-hand=54, in-transit=358. Historical conclude messages consistently confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple orders with ordered\u2192arrived = t\u2192t+4 through Period 42). No recent lost shipments. Pipeline (54+358=412) comfortably covers (L+1) periods of demand at historical levels. I therefore use the default lead time (promised L=4) and default demand estimators so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this keeps forecasts anchored to full historical data while the confirmed L=4 lets the backend size orders to balance the $2 profit vs $1 holding cost tradeoff.

Daily Reward (R_t): $25.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Context: Period 44. On-hand=95, in-transit=331. Historical concludes repeatedly confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (many orders: Period1\u21925 ... Period39\u219243). Demand history shows moderate variability. Reconciliation: on-hand + in-transit (426) provides coverage for multiple periods given typical demand; no evidence of recent lost shipments. Decision: use L='default' (promised 4) because concluded history consistently supports LT=4. Use mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' so OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from demand samples\u2014this balances service level vs holding cost given stable LT and available pipeline stock.

Carry-over insight: Sustained actual lead time = 4 periods confirmed by repeated concluded arrivals through recent history (e.g., orders placed in Periods ... \u2192 arrivals up to Period39\u219243).

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
On-hand=0, in-transit=364; historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods. Demand samples provided (5) show baseline mean used by default. To align with confirmed lead time and stable demand history, use default promised lead time and default demand/volatility calculations so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service (maintain pipeline coverage for L+1 periods) against holding cost given large in-transit stock.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Use default demand estimates (no recent changepoint detected in the small sample set provided) so backend computes (1+L)\xd7sample mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. These settings balance service (accurate L) vs holding cost by relying on observed demand stats and the large pipeline.

Recent demand history shows no clear regime shift vs. provided samples. Use default (promised) lead time and default demand/volatility estimators so OR backend uses full-sample mean/std scaled by (1+L).

Daily Reward (R_t): $326.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 49. Historical conclu de messages consistently confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple orders: e.g., Period1\u21925, Period2\u21926, ..., Period44\u219248). On-hand=58, in-transit=223 \u2014 pipeline coverage is high. Profit=$2, holding=$1 implies q=0.667 so OR backend will target service with moderate safety stock; using default lead time and demand estimators keeps alignment with long-run demand samples and confirmed lead time while avoiding overfitting to recent noisy arrivals. I choose default methods so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history, which balances service level vs holding cost given stable lead time and no calendar shocks.

Carry-over insight: Sustained actual lead time = 4 periods confirmed by repeated concluded arrivals (examples: Period1\u21925, Period2\u21926, Period3\u21927, Period4\u21928, Period6\u219210, ..., Period44\u219248).

LLM Rationale:
Period 50. Historical demand samples mean=111.4, sd estimated by backend. On-hand=0, in-transit=262. Multiple concluded arrivals confirm sustained actual lead time = 4 periods; recent history matches promised L=4. I keep L as default (promised) and use default demand/volatility calculations so OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample set. This leverages confirmed lead time and full-sample demand stats; with 262 in-transit the OR will cap orders appropriately to balance service level (profit $2 vs holding $1) and avoid excess holding given substantial pipeline.
