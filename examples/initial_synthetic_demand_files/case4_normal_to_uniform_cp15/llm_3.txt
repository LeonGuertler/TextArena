No concluded arrivals exist to infer actual lead time; supplier promised 0 but actual lead time unknown. Inventory/pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Decision logic: need to cover current-period demand after ordering; balance expected profit ($2/unit sold) vs holding cost ($1/unit/period). Ordering roughly one-period expected demand maximizes expected profit while limiting exposure to holding costs and potential lost/in-transit orders.
