{
  "rationale": "Lead time inference: concluded history shows actual lead time = 0 (orders consistently arrived same period). Inventory state: on-hand=0, in-transit=0 so any order will arrive in time for this period's demand. Demand outlook: recent realized demands (Periods 36\u201348) average \u224880.8 with high variance (several spikes including 192 in Period 48). OR baseline (uses promised LT and long-run history) recommends 108 units. Profit/holding gives critical fractile q=2/(2+1)=0.6667 (moderate service). Given LT=0, no pipeline, recent mean \u224881 but high volatility, OR's 108 already provides safety stock vs. variability without incurring excessive holding cost (holding=$1/unit/period is high relative to profit). I therefore follow the OR recommendation of 108 units to balance stockout risk from recent spikes and holding cost.",

Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:
============================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: concluded history shows actual lead time = 0 (orders arrive same period), so an order placed now will arrive during this period and affect current demand. Inventory & demand analysis: on-hand=0, in-transit=0 so full exposure to stockouts if we under-order. Recent realized demands (Periods 45\u201349 = 72,18,24,192,182) give a short-run mean \u224897.6 with very high variance and two large spikes (48\u201349). OR recommends 110 using promised lead time and historical samples; that recommendation is slightly above the recent mean and provides modest buffer for the observed spikes. Decision: follow OR recommendation of 110 units (arrives same period) to balance profit (=$2 per sold unit) against $1 holding cost given high recent demand and high stockout risk. This keeps expected sales high while accepting holding cost risk from potential overstock.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Actual lead time=0 and on-hand=0; recent short-run mean demand \u224898 with high variance including two large spikes, so follow OR's 110 to cover likely demand while limiting holding cost.",
