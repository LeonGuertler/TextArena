Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. Recent demand samples: [112,97,116,138,94], mean \u2248111.4, std \u224817.6. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so no arrivals expected or overdue. No concluded lead-time observations yet; use promised lead time. I select default methods so the OR backend uses (1+L)\xd7historical mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std to set base-stock and cap; this balances service vs holding cost given no evidence of regime change or lost shipments.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_2 start. Recent demands: [112,97,116,138,94], mean=111.4. On-hand=0, in-transit=141 (matches Period 1 order); Period 1 conclude shows arrived=0 so the Period 1 shipment is overdue (delay or lost) but no confirmed lead-time observed yet. Use promised lead time (default) because only one conclude with no arrival provides insufficient evidence to change lead-time estimate. Use default demand and volatility aggregation ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR engine can apply its base-stock logic; this balances service level (meeting ~expected demand) against holding cost while we monitor the overdue shipment for confirmation before altering L or forecasts.

Carry-over insight: Overdue shipment: 141 units ordered on Period 1 not arrived by Period 1 conclude \u2014 possible delayed or lost; monitor for arrival before changing lead-time estimate.

Daily Reward (R_t): $207.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3 start: observed recent arrival shows the Period 1 order (141) arrived in Period 2 -> observed lead_time=1 (contrasts with promised 2). Demand history samples: [112,97,116,138,94] (mean=111.4). On-hand=25, in-transit=137. Given confirmed lead_time=1 from concluded message, use calculated lead time to adapt the review+lead period. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level (profit > holding cost) without overreacting to limited history or a single overdue event.

Carry-over insight: Observed actual lead time = 1 period (Period 1 order arrived in Period 2); prior overdue concern resolved by that arrival.

Daily Reward (R_t): $50.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_4: on-hand=0, in-transit=207. Historical demand samples = [112,97,116,138,94] (mean=111.4). Recent conclues show one observed lead time = 1 (Period1 order arrived in Period2) and no concluded arrivals for the Period2 order yet (still within promised LT). Given confirmed LT=1 from concluded history, use calculated lead time (average of observed lead times). Use default demand aggregation ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and default volatility (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) to keep forecasts stable given limited data and resolved late-arrival signal. This balances service (lower L reduces required pipeline cushion) vs holding cost while accounting for the confirmed shorter lead time.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead time = 1 period based on Period_2 conclude: 141 units ordered on Period 1 arrived in Period 2 (lead_time=1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5: demand history [112,97,116,138,94] shows mean ~111 and recent volatility moderate. On-hand=0, in-transit=225 (sufficient coverage). Observed concluded arrivals indicate actual lead time = 1 period (Period 2 conclude: 141 units ordered on Period 1 arrived, lead_time=1); no persistent missing shipments. Therefore set L to 'calculate' (use average of observed lead times = 1) so the OR engine plans for a 1-period lead. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from full sample, preserving statistical robustness and balancing service level vs holding cost given current in-transit coverage.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead_time = 1 period based on Period 2 conclude: 141 units ordered on Period 1 arrived in Period 2 (lead_time=1).

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_6: on-hand=0, in-transit=225. Historical concluded lead-times consistently 1 period (Period 2-5 conclude messages show arrivals from prior orders with lead_time=1), so use inferred L=1. Demand history (samples provided) shows modest variability; use recent_N (N=5) to capture current mean across available samples for (1+L)\xd7mean. Keep sigma_hat as default to let backend scale std over (1+L). This balances service (shorter inferred L reduces required pipeline) while capturing recent demand level to avoid stockouts given current zero on-hand and sizable in-transit.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7: on-hand=0, in-transit=225. Recent concluded history shows multiple confirmations of actual lead_time=1 (Period 2 conclude: 141 units ordered on Period 1 arrived in Period 2, lead_time=1). Pipeline (225) may arrive with that realized lead time but remains unseen until conclude messages. Demand has softened recently (last demands: 92,88,84) versus earlier higher samples; to reflect recent lower demand I use a recent mean for forecasting. Set L to be calculated from observed lead times to capture the confirmed 1-period regime. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to weight the last 5 demand samples across review+lead period. Keep sigma_hat default to let backend compute volatility across all samples scaled by sqrt(1+L). These choices balance service (acknowledged shorter lead time) against holding cost given zero on-hand and sizable in-transit.

Daily Reward (R_t): $36.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8: on-hand=0, in-transit=207, recent demands = [107,116,64,92,88,84,93] (history). Concluded arrivals show mixed lead times: order on Period 1 arrived in Period 2 (lead_time=1); order on Period 4 arrived in Period 7 (lead_time=3). This indicates variable/unstable lead time. I set L to 'calculate' so backend averages observed lead times (uses concluded evidence) rather than trusting promised=2. Given limited data and no clear demand regime shift, use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). Parameters balance service level vs holding cost by letting the OR engine compute base stock using observed lead-time-adjusted demand mean and variability.

Carry-over insight: New: Lead time variability detected \u2014 observed lead_times = 1 (Period1\u21922) and 3 (Period4\u21927); average lead_time \u22482. Treat lead time as variable and use observed-average for ordering.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9: recent demand samples mean=111.4 (samples: [112,97,116,138,94]). Observed lead_times = 1 (P1\u2192P2) and 3 (P4\u2192P7) \u2192 average \u22482; pipeline in-transit=242 (likely orders from P2,P3,P8). On-hand=0. Required coverage target = (1+L)*mean; with L estimated from observed-average we expect (1+2)*mean \u2248 3\xd7111.4 \u2248334 units. In-transit (242) falls short of that target, so the OR engine should top up. I choose L="calculate" to let backend use the average of observed lead times (captures variable lead time signal). For demand and volatility I use default methods so the backend computes mu_hat and sigma_hat from all samples scaled by (1+L). This balances service level (using observed-average lead time) against holding cost while letting the OR engine apply the prescribed safety-stock cap.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10: recent history shows variable lead times (observed = 1 and 3 periods), demand history moderate (past samples mean \u2248111). On-hand=0, in-transit=266 units\u2014this partially covers upcoming demand but is below (1+L)*mean if L\u22482. To account for observed lead-time variability use average observed lead time for L; keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default (use all samples) so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This balances service level (by increasing L to reflect slower arrivals) against holding cost given sizable in-transit stock.

Period 11 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=273. Observed concluded lead_times = 1 (Period1\u21922) and 3 (Period4\u21927) \u2192 variable; use average lead time estimate. Recent observed customer demand (most recent 5 periods with concluded demand): [137, 78, 124, 93, 84] (use recent window to capture upward spikes and volatility). Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the OR engine react to the recent demand regime while L='calculate' uses observed lead-time average to account for variability. Pipeline (273) will be compared by backend to (1+L)-period demand; current params aim to balance service (higher mu_hat) vs holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12: on-hand=0, in-transit=288. Historical demands [112,97,116,138,94,107,116,64,92,88,84,93,137,78,124,58] show high and variable demand; recent arrivals indicate lead-time variability (observed lead_times = 1 and 3). I will use calculated average lead time to capture variability, and use default demand aggregations ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR backend computes base-stock and caps using full sample statistics. This balances service (accounting for longer average lead time) vs holding cost by letting backend set safety stock from observed demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Lead time variability: observed lead_times = 1 (Period1\u21922) and 3 (Period4\u21927); average \u22482. Treat lead time as variable and use observed-average for ordering.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13: on-hand=0, in-transit=257. Historical observed lead_times from concluded messages: Period1\u21922=1, Period4\u21927=3, Period9\u219212=3, Period10\u219212=2 \u2192 observed average \u22482.25. Some shipments have been delayed (variable LT) so using the observed-average LT reduces risk of under-ordering versus promised LT. I choose L='calculate' so backend uses the average of observed lead times. Demand history samples = [112,97,116,138,94]; no clear recent demand regime shift, so use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend will scale by 1+L and sqrt(1+L) respectively) to let the OR engine compute base-stock with current LT estimate; this balances service vs holding given Profit=$2 and Holding=$1.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14: on-hand=0, in-transit=293. Observed concluded lead_times from history: 1 (P1\u2192P2), 3 (P4\u2192P7), 3 (P9\u2192P12), 2 (P10\u2192P12) \u2192 average \u22482.25. Demand history (Periods1\u201313) mean \u224895.15. To account for variable lead time I set L to the observed average (calculate). Use default demand scaling so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) which captures full-sample demand level; sigma_hat default to reflect whole-sample volatility scaled by \u221a(1+L). This keeps orders conservative given long/inconsistent lead times and large in-transit volume, while letting the OR backend compute safety stock tradeoff using profit/holding costs.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15: on-hand=0, in-transit=286. Historical observed lead_times from concluded messages = [1,3,3,2,3] (avg=2.4) indicating variable/longer-than-promised lead times and occasional delays. I set L to 'calculate' so the backend uses the average observed lead time (captures variability). For demand, use 'default' mu_hat and sigma_hat so estimates are (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples \u2014 this leverages full historical demand (samples=[112,97,116,138,94]) while letting the backend size safety stock via its service-level formula. This approach balances service (accounting for longer average lead time) against holding cost and avoids overreacting to isolated late arrivals.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16: on-hand=0, in-transit=314, recent demands high and volatile (history samples: [112,97,116,138,94]). Observed concluded lead_times = [1,3,3,2,3] (avg \u22482.4) demonstrating variable/longer-than-promised lead times and occasional multi-period delays. To capture that variability I let the backend compute an empirical average lead time from observations (method=calculate) and use default demand aggregation for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the engine applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples. This balances higher cover for uncertain/long lead times while relying on full-sample demand stats; in-transit 314 already provides coverage so parameters aim to avoid excess additional orders while raising safety stock via larger L.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17: on-hand=0, in-transit=296. Historical demands = [112,97,116,138,94,107,116,64,92,88,84,93,137,78,124,58,92,104,115,118,61] (samples shown in history; core past five provided earlier). Observed concluded lead_times = {1,3,3,2,3,1} (average \u22482.17) \u2014 clear lead-time variability. To account for variable actual lead time I let the backend compute the observed-average lead time (method=calculate). For demand sizing and uncertainty I use default formulas so mu_hat and sigma_hat scale with (1+L) and sqrt(1+L) respectively, letting the OR engine apply the base-stock and cap rules using the inferred L. This balances service (higher L\u2192larger review+lead demand) against holding cost while preserving backend statistical treatment. Current in-transit stock (296) will be reconciled by backend pipeline in ordering calculation.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18: on-hand=2, in-transit=314. Historical observed lead_times from conclues: 1 (P1\u2192P2), 3 (P4\u2192P7), 3 (P9\u2192P12), 2 (P10\u2192P12), 3 (P11\u2192P14), 1 (P15\u2192P16), 3 (P14\u2192P17). These show variable lead times averaging \u22482.29. Use 'calculate' for L so backend averages observed lead times; keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as defaults so backend scales demand (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility with that L. This balances service (higher L raises required pipeline cover) against holding cost given high in-transit inventory and profit/holding ratio.

Carry-over insight: Lead time variability confirmed: observed lead_times = [1,3,3,2,3,1,3], average \u22482.29 \u2014 treat lead time as variable and use observed-average for ordering.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19. Recent realized lead_times = [1,3,3,2,3,1,3] (avg \u22482.29). Historical demand samples mean=111.4, std\u224815.74 (samples: [112,97,116,138,94]). On-hand=0, in-transit=316 (large pipeline). To accommodate observed variable lead time I use the inferred average lead time (calculate) so mu_hat and sigma_hat scale with (1+L) using all samples (default). This keeps forecasts anchored to full-sample demand while the backend's base-stock will account for service level tradeoff; large in-transit reduces immediate ordering risk.

Use calculate for L to capture observed-average lead time; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend scales demand stats by (1+L) and variance by sqrt(1+L). This keeps ordering responsive to measured lead-time variability while letting OR engine apply service-level cap. Current pipeline (320) likely covers several periods of demand, so no explicit upward bias in mu_hat.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21: on-hand=0, in-transit=292. Historical concluded lead_times = [1,3,3,2,3,1,3,3,2] (orders: P1\u21922,P4\u21927,P9\u219212,P10\u219212,P11\u219214,P15\u219216,P14\u219217,P17\u219220,P18\u219220) => average \u22482.33 and clear lead-time variability. Several late arrivals and multi-period delays justify using an inferred average lead time rather than the promised 2. To size review+lead demand, use default demand estimates (all-sample mean scaled by 1+L) so the OR engine retains full historical demand info while accounting for longer effective lead time. Variability handled by keeping sigma default (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std).

Carry-over insight: Lead time regime changed to variable with observed lead_times [1,3,3,2,3,1,3,3,2], average \u22482.33 \u2192 treat lead time as longer and variable; use observed-average for ordering.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:

Several past late arrivals resolved (no persistent lost-order signal now) but variability remains. I set L='calculate' so backend uses the observed average lead time from concluded history. Demand stats: use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) so the OR engine raises target stock proportional to the longer, variable lead time while keeping standard demand estimates. This balances higher service level (covering variable/longer lead times) against holding cost, and leverages the large in-transit pipeline (317) so orders aren't doubled unnecessarily.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:

Pipeline (332) is large but shipments have been delayed variably; use recent-average lead time to capture this variability. Set L to recent_N (N=9) to reflect observed average lead time. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full demand history; this balances service level against holding cost given uncertain/longer lead times.

Carry-over insight: Lead time regime shifted to longer and variable; observed lead_times (Periods concluded) = [1,3,3,2,3,1,3,3,2], average \u22482.33. Use observed-average lead time for ordering until new evidence.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26. Recent history shows high and variable demand (samples [112,97,116,138,94]) with multiple concluded lead times varying (observed average \u22482.3 across concluded shipments and recent lead_time=3 arrivals). On-hand=0, in-transit=304 \u2014 substantial pipeline exists but lead time has been variable, so use inferred-average lead time rather than promised to size the review+lead demand. Set L by averaging observed lead times (calculate) to capture variability; leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting the engine target the profit/holding tradeoff given the inferred L and existing pipeline.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27: on-hand=0, in-transit=304. Historical concluded arrivals show variable lead times (observed values include 1,2,3 with recent-average \u22482.3) and some delayed shipments. I set L to the observed-average method so the backend uses the empirical mean lead time. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat at default so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, which raises target base-stock to cover the longer/variable lead time and balances service level vs holding cost.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_28: on-hand=0, in-transit=320. Historical concluded arrivals show variable lead_times (observed sequence: 1,3,3,2,3,1,3,3,2,2,1,3,1; mean\u22482.15). Use average observed lead time to capture variability and recent longer shipment outcomes. Set L by 'calculate' (use avg observed lead_time). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean(demand) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(demand) \u2014 this balances service level (longer/variable L demands higher base stock) against holding cost while leveraging in-transit inventory.

Carry-over insight: Lead time regime: observed lead_times (concluded arrivals) = [1,3,3,2,3,1,3,3,2,2,1,3,1], average \u22482.15 \u2014 treat lead time as longer and variable; use observed-average for ordering until new evidence.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29: on-hand=0, in-transit=305. Historical concluded lead_times show variability (observed values across concluded arrivals average \u22482.15 and have trended longer than promised L=2). Many recent shipments arrived with lead_times of 1\u20133 periods; using the observed-average lead time reduces stockouts risk given large pipeline and variable arrivals. Choose L by aggregating observed lead times (backend will compute average). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend scales demand forecast by (1+L) and volatility by sqrt(1+L) consistent with the inferred L. This balances service level (avoid stockouts while substantial in-transit exists) against holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Lead time regime: variable and longer-than-promised; observed concluded lead_times average \u22482.15 (mix of 1\u20133). Use observed-average lead time for ordering until new evidence.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Concluded arrivals show variable lead times (mix of 1\u20133 periods across many concluded orders); use observed-average lead time (backend 'calculate') to capture this variability. Demand history is limited in the provided statistical seed; no clear sustained demand regime shift\u2014use default demand aggregators so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from samples. This balances service (longer/variable lead time increases L via 'calculate') against holding cost while avoiding overfitting to recent noisy spikes.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_31 with on-hand=0 and in-transit=329. Historical concluded lead_times show high variability (observed arrivals with lead_times = [1,3,3,2,3,1,3,3,2,2,1,3,1,1] \u2014 14 observations, mean \u22482.07). Pipeline is large but arrivals are delayed/variable; use the empirical recent-average lead time to capture variability. Chosen methods: L by recent_N (N=14) to reflect observed-average lead time; mu_hat default to use (1+L)\xd7mean of all demand samples (demand history mean=111.4) so backend scales forecast with inferred L; sigma_hat default to scale volatility with inferred L. These settings make the OR backend increase safety stock for the longer/variable lead time while letting it compute base stock and cap from historical demand.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_32 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=329. Historical concluded lead_times are variable (mix 1\u20133) with recent observed-average \u22482.15 \u2014 treat lead time as longer-than-promised and variable, so set explicit L to 2.15. Demand has been volatile with many recent high observations; use EWMA to tilt forecast toward recent higher demands (gamma=0.3) for mu_hat. Use default sigma_hat (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) to let backend scale volatility with chosen L. These settings aim to raise target base-stock to cover longer, variable lead time while adapting mean to recent demand increases, balancing service level vs holding cost. On-hand + in-transit (329) will be reconciled by backend ordering rule.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 decision. On-hand=0, in-transit=459. Historical concluded arrivals show high lead-time variability (mix of 1\u20133 periods) with recent concluded lead_time=3 for the Period29\u219232 arrival. To capture the current variable, slightly-longer regime I set L using a recent-average of observed lead times (recent_N) so the OR backend plans for the empirical lead-time; mu_hat and sigma_hat use defaults so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given observed demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Lead time remains variable and longer-than-promised; recent concluded lead_times (most recent 13 observations) average \u22482.15 \u2014 use observed-average lead time for ordering until new evidence.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_34: on-hand=0, in-transit=459. Historical concluded lead_times show variable, longer-than-promised behavior (mix of 1\u20133) with recent average \u22482.15. To capture current lead-time regime use recent-average over the most recent lead-time observations. Demand has shifted recently and is volatile; use a recent_N demand estimate (last 5 periods) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect current demand level and variability. These choices help the OR engine set a base-stock that covers (1+L) periods of demand while accounting for increased lead-time uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Lead time regime remains variable and longer-than-promised; recent concluded lead_times average \u22482.15 (mix of 1\u20133). Use observed-average lead time for ordering until new evidence.

Many concluded arrivals show variable lead_times (mix of 1\u20133) and recent average \u22482.15, so use observed-average lead-time via 'calculate' to let backend average concluded lead times. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) so the OR engine combines the inferred lead time with the long-run demand seed; this leverages the large in-transit pipeline while keeping safety stock responsive to observed demand variability. This balances service (profit>holding cost) against holding cost given heavy pipeline inventory.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 with on-hand=0 and large in-transit=459. Historical concluded arrivals show variable actual lead_times (mix of 1\u20133) with recent average \u22482.15; multiple overdue/late arrivals observed in history. I set L explicit=2.15 to reflect the longer, variable lead-time regime so the backend plans for ~(1+2.15) review+lead coverage. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR engine uses the full-sample demand mean/variance scaled by (1+L), letting increased L raise the order target while avoiding overfitting to recent noisy demand spikes. This addresses missing/delayed shipments by increasing pipeline coverage without changing demand estimates.

Carry-over insight: Lead time regime variable and longer-than-promised; observed concluded lead_times (mix of 1\u20133) recent average \u22482.15 \u2014 use observed-average lead time for ordering until new evidence.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39: on-hand=0, in-transit=459. Historical concluded lead_times show variable, longer-than-promised behavior (mix of 1\u20133, recent average \u22482.15). Use a recent-average lead time to capture variability and longer effective L so mu_hat covers (1+L) periods. Given abundant in-transit inventory, keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as defaults so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all demand samples, letting OR engine scale safety stock using the inferred L.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_40: on-hand=0, in-transit=459. Historical demand samples (seed) = [112,97,116,138,94]; recent concluded arrivals show variable lead_times (mix of 1\u20133) with observed-average \u22482.15. Reconcile: substantial pipeline (459) likely covers multiple periods but actual arrivals delayed historically. Use L='calculate' so backend averages observed lead times (captures variable/longer regime). Use mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' so demand scale uses all samples ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) and lets OR engine compute safety stock given inferred L. This balances service level (using observed-average lead time) against holding costs given large in-transit position.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41: on-hand=0, in-transit=459. Historical concluded lead_times are variable (mix of 1\u20133) with recent average \u22482.15; multiple past overdue arrivals resolved but variability persists. To account for the longer, variable lead time I set L explicit=2.15 (uses observed-average lead time). Demand history (samples mean \u2248111.4) is stable enough to use the full-sample default forecast scaled by (1+L), so mu_hat and sigma_hat use default methods. This combination raises the base-stock to cover the longer review+lead horizon while keeping variability captured by the backend's sigma estimate; large in-transit stock will reduce immediate order quantity via pipeline offset.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:

Historical concluded lead_times show high variability (mix of 1\u20133) with recent average \u22482.15; treat lead time as longer/variable and let backend use observed-average. Use 'calculate' for L to average observed lead times; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from demand samples. This leverages pipeline inventory while increasing safety stock for longer, variable lead time.

Period 43. On-hand=0, in-transit=459. Historical demand samples = [112,97,116,138,94] (mean\u2248111.4). Multiple concluded arrivals show variable lead times (mix of 1\u20133) with recent observed-average \u22482.15; treat lead time as variable and use observed-average. Use L='calculate' so backend averages observed lead times. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so (1+L) scaling is applied to historical mean/std by backend, preserving responsiveness to the inferred longer/more-variable lead time and balancing service level vs holding cost.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 start. Demand history shows mean ~111.4 from samples [112,97,116,138,94]. Observed concluded lead_times have been variable and longer-than-promised (recent average \u22482.15) so use the empirical average lead-time calculation method. On-hand=0, in-transit=459 \u2014 current pipeline is large and should cover (1+L) periods; no new overdue arrivals to reinterpret lead time. Set L to be computed from observed concluded lead times (calculate) and leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as defaults so the OR backend uses all samples scaled by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L) respectively. This balances higher service level for variable/longer lead time while relying on existing demand history to avoid over-adjusting for noisy recent spikes.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 with on-hand=0 and in-transit=459. Historical concluded lead_times are variable (mix of 1\u20133) with recent average \u22482.15, indicating lead time longer and variable than promised. Use 'calculate' so L is set to the average of observed lead times (lets OR backend account for realized variability). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so demand forecast = (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of historical samples, allowing the backend's base-stock/cap calculations to balance service vs holding costs given the longer inferred lead time and substantial pipeline inventory.

Period 46: on-hand=0, in-transit=459. Historical concluded lead_times show persistent variability (mix of 1\u20133, recent average \u22482.15). Large in-transit already likely covers multiple review+lead periods. I choose L by 'calculate' so backend uses the observed-average lead time from concluded arrivals. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so demand forecast = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and volatility = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This balances service (longer/variable lead-time) while relying on the large in-transit position to limit extra ordering and holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Period 47. On-hand=0, in-transit=459 units. Historical demand samples = [112,97,116,138,94] (mean ~111). History shows variable actual lead_times (mix of 1\u20133) with recent observed-average \u22482.15; treat lead time as variable and use observed-average. Use L method 'calculate' so backend averages concluded lead times. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all samples; this balances service level (accounts for longer variable lead time) while not overstating demand shifts given limited sample size. High in-transit inventory reduces urgency to inflate mu_hat now.

Carry-over history shows variable, longer-than-promised lead times with recent average \u22482.15; use recent average to capture variability. Set L by recent_N (N=13) to reflect recent concluded lead-time mix and avoid underordering given many delayed arrivals. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, retaining the full-sample demand signal while inflating for the longer effective review+lead period. This balances service-level (higher mu_hat due to longer L) against holding cost given large in-transit stock.
