Inventory timing: On-hand=2 and In-transit=114 are scheduled to arrive during Period 50 demand resolution (orders placed in Periods 46\u201349); thus available inventory for Period 50 demand \u2248116. Forecast: recent sustained demand \u224898 units/period (Periods 7\u201311 and carry-over insight). Coverage requirement: with L=4, target coverage = (L+1)=5 periods \xd7 98 \u2248 490 units. Current pipeline+on-hand = 116 \u2192 shortfall \u2248 374 units. Ordering now will arrive in Period 54 and therefore must ensure we don\u2019t stock out in Periods 51\u201353 while avoiding excessive holding cost. I compromise between OR cap (166) and full replenishment (374) by ordering 300 units: this meaningfully reduces stockout risk for the next 5 periods (expected supply after arrivals \u2248416) while limiting holding cost exposure given moderate holding=$1/unit.
