If promised L=2, pipeline must cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand (\u2248334 units), so current pipeline is short by ~172; OR\u2019s capped recommendation (136) brings pipeline closer but still below base_stock (leaves some risk).

Because the observed shorter lead time is not yet a sustained signal and lost-order risk exists, I follow the OR-capped recommendation to increase pipeline without over-ordering. This balances profit vs. holding cost while reducing stockout risk.\n\nStep 5 \u2014 Risk notes: If further concludes show consistent lead_time=1 or additional arrivals, I will increase future orders to target a 2-period pipeline appropriate to the confirmed lead time.

OR recommends 0 using promised L and demand history; given high risk of lost shipments and no confirmed recent arrivals, placing additional orders risks creating large in-transit that may never arrive (and if they do, generate holding cost). Demand samples show single-period mean ~113 (from [112,97,116,138,94]) so unmet demand is high, but without reliable arrivals ordering more now is likely wasted.
