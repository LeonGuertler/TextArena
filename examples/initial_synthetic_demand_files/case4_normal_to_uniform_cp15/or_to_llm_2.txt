  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: concluded history (Period 3) confirms actual lead time = 0; recent concludes consistently show orders arriving same period. Inventory & pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=0 so no coverage for current-period demand. Demand analysis: OR uses historical sample mean\u2248111.4 and sd\u224817.6, base-stock \u2248126 (with profit/holding fractile q=0.8 \u2192 z\u22480.842) and caps \u2248140; OR recommends 129 units (capped policy rounding). Recent periods show two very large spikes (Periods 48\u201349: 192, 182), but this is not a sustained (\u22653 period) regime shift and earlier periods are variable. With lead time = 0, orders arrive in time to meet same-period demand; holding cost is moderate ($1) vs profit $4, so the cost of understock is higher than modest overstocks.
