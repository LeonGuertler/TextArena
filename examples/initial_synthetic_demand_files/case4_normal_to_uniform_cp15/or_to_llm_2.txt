OR computed base_stock\u2248347 and then applied its cap to recommend 141 (matches OR output).

There are no concluded arrivals or evidence of shorter lead time or lost shipments to reduce safety needs. Given profit $2 vs holding $1 (critical fractile \u22480.667) we still prefer to satisfy expected demand over strictly following OR's cap. Therefore order enough to cover the estimated (L+1)-period demand: round \u03bc\u0302 down to 334 units (on-hand+in-transit=0 so order = 334).
