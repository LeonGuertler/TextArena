Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. No on-hand or in-transit inventory; no concluded arrivals to infer actual lead time. Historical demand samples: [112,97,116,138,94], mean=111.4, std\u224815.6. Promised lead time is 2; use default L to let backend assume promised lead time. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample\u2014this balances service level (profit>holding) without overreacting to limited history or unobserved shipments.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_2: demand history shows steady mean (~111.4) from five samples. On-hand=0, in-transit=141 (order placed Period 1) \u2014 no conclude shows arrivals yet, which is consistent with promised lead time=2 (arrival will appear later). I use default lead time (promised) because no concluded arrivals exist to infer a different L. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing a stable forecast (covers L+1 periods) while the pipeline arrival is pending.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3: on-hand 25, in-transit 137. Historical demands show mean ~111.4 (samples [112,97,116,138,94]). Period 2 conclude shows arrival of the Period 1 order with lead_time=1 (one observed lead time). Given that evidence, I set lead time to be inferred from observed data (average observed lead times). Using L=1 shortens the replenishment horizon to match realized arrivals and keeps pipeline accounting consistent. For demand forecasting I use the full-sample defaults ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to smooth over limited data and avoid overreacting to recent noise while the lead-time regime is clarified.

Carry-over insight: Observed actual lead_time=1 period (Period 1 order arrived in Period 2); evidence: 'Period 2 conclude: arrived=141 units (ordered on Period 1, lead_time was 1 periods)'.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_4: on-hand=0, in-transit=207 (orders from Periods 2&3). Historical demands=[112,97,116,138,94], mean=111.4. Concluded history shows an actual lead_time=1 period (Period 1 order arrived in Period 2), so I infer actual lead time shorter than promised. Set L by calculation of observed lead times to let backend use empirical average (L=1). Use mu_hat default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) to capture demand over review+lead period. Use sigma_hat default so backend computes sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples). This keeps parameterization consistent with observed lead_time=1, preserves statistical grounding from all samples, and avoids overreacting to limited recent noise while ensuring pipeline + orders cover the (L+1) periods of demand.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_5: on-hand=0, in-transit=225 (orders from P2-P4). Historical demands [112,97,116,138,94] mean=111.4. Concluded evidence shows an actual lead_time=1 period (Period 2 conclude: P1 order arrived with lead_time=1). Some later orders haven't concluded and may be lost, so be conservative by using the observed lead-time average. Chosen methods: L='calculate' to use observed lead times (captures the measured 1-period lead); mu_hat='default' to scale demand forecast by (1+L)\xd7overall mean (accounts for current short lead estimate and smooths across all samples); sigma_hat='default' to reflect overall demand volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). These settings provide the OR engine a demand-plus-safety baseline while acknowledging the shorter observed lead time and mitigating risk from potential lost shipments.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_6: on-hand=0, in-transit=225 (orders placed on Periods 2-4). Historical demand samples mean=111.4 (n=5). Observed concluded lead_time=1 period for the Period 1 order (Period 2 conclude). Subsequent orders (ordered on Periods 2-4) have not concluded by their expected arrival windows, suggesting some shipments may be delayed or lost. To be responsive to the observed faster lead time when concluded but also acknowledge demand persistence, set L by calculating the average of observed lead times (captures the single confirmed observation of 1). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, yielding moderate replenishment given current pipeline. This balances service (using observed faster lead time) while relying on full-sample demand statistics to avoid overreacting to noisy short-term gaps and to cover the (L+1) demand periods.

Carry-over insight: New: Orders placed on Periods 2-4 (total in-transit=225) have not concluded by their expected arrivals after the single observed lead_time=1; possible lost/delayed shipments for orders on Period_2 (137 units), Period_3 (70 units), Period_4 (18 units). Evidence: Period 3-5 concludes show arrived=0 for those orders.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=225. Historical demand samples: [112,97,116,138,94] (mean=111.4). Observed one concluded lead_time=1 (Period 2 conclude) but multiple subsequent orders (Periods 2\u20134) failed to conclude by expected arrival \u2192 likely lost/delayed shipments rather than systematic shorter lead time. Promised lead time is 2; because arrivals are unreliable, stick to promised lead time (use default) so OR backend plans for the longer review+lead window. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat to let backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples (conservative pooling of data) which raises base-stock to cover (L+1) periods of demand and offsets stockouts from missing shipments while balancing holding cost via OR's q calculation.

Carry-over insight: Orders placed on Periods 2\u20134 (total in-transit=225) have not concluded by expected arrivals after an observed lead_time=1; evidence of lost/delayed shipments (Period 3\u20135 concludes show arrived=0 for those orders).

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8. Recent demand samples: [112,97,116,138,94] (mean=111.4). On-hand=0, in-transit=300. History of concludes: observed lead_times = 1 (Period2 conclude: P1\u2192P2) and 3 (Period7 conclude: P4\u2192P7); multiple orders (P2\u2013P4) did not conclude on expected schedule \u2192 evidence of longer/variable lead times and possible lost/deliveries. To protect service while accounting for irregular arrivals, set L using observed lead-time average (backend will compute), and use default demand aggregation so mu_hat/sigma_hat scale with chosen L and full-sample statistics. This raises target base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of demand despite shipment uncertainty while letting OR engine cap orders to limit exposure if many shipments are lost.

Carry-over insight: Observed lead-time regime shifted: concluded lead_times = 1 (early) and 3 (recent) \u2192 average observed lead_time now 2 periods; evidence: 'Period 2 conclude: ... lead_time was 1 periods' and 'Period 7 conclude: ... lead_time was 3 periods'. Also persistent non-conclusions for orders placed Periods 2\u20134 (possible lost/delayed shipments), total in-transit shown=300.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9: on-hand=0, in-transit=300, recent periods show repeated stockouts and variable demand (notable 137 in Period 8). Concluded lead_times observed = 1 and 3 (average \u22482) and multiple lost/delayed shipments for orders placed in Periods 2\u20134, so promised L=2 appears optimistic; treat L=2 explicitly to account for mixed/lengthened arrivals. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples\u2014this balances higher coverage (1+L=3 periods) against holding cost given high in-transit volume and recent stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Observed lead-time regime shifted to average 2 periods (evidence: Period 2 conclude lead_time=1; Period 7 conclude lead_time=3; persistent non-conclusions for orders placed Periods 2\u20134 indicating lost/delayed shipments).

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10. Recent demand samples show high variability with frequent stockouts (recent concluded demands: 92,88,84,93,137,78 and historical samples mean ~111). On-hand=0, in-transit=325 \u2014 many past orders remain unconfirmed (some likely delayed/lost). Observed concluded lead_times = 1 (Period 2) and 3 (Period 7) \u2192 average observed lead_time = 2 periods; use calculate to let backend average all observed lead times. Use default demand sizing ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and default volatility to let OR engine apply its standard safety-stock formula given the chosen L. This balances replenishment aggressiveness (to recover from stockouts and cover multi-period demand) against holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=232. Historical concluded lead_times = 1 (Period 2) and 3 (Periods 7 and 10) \u2192 recent regime shows longer, variable lead-times. Several orders (Periods 2\u20134) experienced prolonged non-conclusions, indicating lost/delayed shipments. I choose L.method='calculate' so backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures mixture of 1 and 3-day regimes). For demand parameters I choose default mu_hat and default sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples \u2014 this keeps forecasts grounded in full-sample demand while letting increased L raise the review+lead demand and safety stock automatically to protect service given observed delays.

Carry-over insight: Observed lead-time regime shifted upward and variable: concluded lead_times = 1 (Period 2) and 3 (Periods 7,10) \u2192 average \u22482.33; persistent non-conclusions for orders placed Periods 2\u20134 indicate lost/delayed shipments (evidence: Periods 3\u20135 concludes arrived=0; later arrivals show 3-period delays).

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_12: recent demand has been elevated and volatile (history demands [112,97,116,138,94,107,116,64,92,88,84,93,137,78,124,58]; many stockouts). On-hand=0, in-transit=294 \u2014 several past orders showed long/variable delays and some lost shipments. Observed concluded lead_times = 1 (Period 2) and 3 (Periods 7,10) \u2192 average \u22482.33; this justifies using an inferred longer lead time to cover delayed arrivals. I choose L='calculate' to let backend average observed lead times (captures recent shift to ~2.33). For demand forecast I use 'default' so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) \u2014 conservative aggregation of history given volatility and stockouts. For uncertainty I use 'default' so sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). These settings raise the base-stock to protect service level against the now-longer/variable lead time while letting the OR engine cap orders to limit holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Observed lead-time regime shifted upward and variable: concluded lead_times = 1 (Period 2) and 3 (Periods 7,10) \u2192 average \u22482.33; persistent non-conclusions for orders placed Periods 2\u20134 indicate lost/delayed shipments (evidence: Periods 3\u20135 concludes arrived=0; later arrivals show 3-period delays).

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_13: on-hand=0, in-transit=274. Recent concluded lead_times = 1 (Period2), 3 (Periods7,10,12) \u2192 observed average lead_time \u22482.5 and evidence of delayed/lost shipments for earlier orders; demand history mean ~111.4 (samples provided). To account for the shifted/variable lead-time regime use calculated average lead time so backend uses observed lead times. Use default demand sizing ((1+L)*mean of all samples) and default volatility so the OR engine applies standard base-stock sizing given the inferred L while keeping estimation simple and robust versus noisy short-term spikes.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime has shifted upward and become variable; concluded lead_times = 1 and multiple 3s \u2192 average observed lead_time \u22482.5 (evidence: Period 2 conclude lead_time=1; Periods 7,10,12 conclude lead_time=3). Persistent delayed/non-concluded orders indicate some lost/delayed shipments; in-transit currently large (274).

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_14: on-hand=0, in-transit=306, recent demands=[112,97,116,138,94,116,64,92,88,84,93,137,78,124,58,92,104] (history). Concluded lead_times observed = {1,3,3,3,1} \u2192 mean \u22482.2 and high variability; multiple orders (early Periods 2\u20134) showed non-conclusions then later 3-period arrivals, indicating a regime shift and some lost/delayed shipments. I select L by "calculate" to let backend average observed lead times (captures upward/variable regime). For demand I choose "default" so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) (conservative pooling of all history). For sigma_hat I choose "default" so volatility uses all samples scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances higher lead-time risk (via calculated L) with stable demand estimates while avoiding overreacting to noisy short-term spikes; it also ensures pipeline coverage for (L+1) periods given large in-transit and past lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime shifted upward and become variable: concluded lead_times = 1 and multiple 3s \u2192 average observed lead_time \u22482.2 (evidence: concluded lead_times 1 on Period_2 and Period_13; 3 on Periods_7,10,12). Persistent delayed/non-concluded shipments and large in-transit (306) indicate some lost/delayed shipments.

LLM Rationale:
Period_15: observed concluded lead_times show a mix of 1s and multiple 3s (avg \u22482.2) with many long-unconcluded shipments and in-transit=254. To be conservative and avoid over-reacting to noisy 3s while acknowledging longer delays, set L explicit=2.0. Use default demand estimates (mu_hat & sigma_hat) so backend computes (1+L)\xd7sample mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7sample std from the five-sample history; current pipeline (254) is likely short of the resulting base_stock, so backend will place replenishment to cover the (L+1)-period coverage target while balancing profit vs holding cost.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=318. Historical concluded lead_times = 1 (Period 2,13) and multiple 3s (Periods 7,10,12,14) \u2192 average observed lead_time \u2248 2.33. Several orders remain non-concluded for long durations in earlier periods, indicating persistent lost/delayed shipments and a variable, elevated lead-time regime. I choose L by 'calculate' to let backend use the average of observed lead times. For demand parameters use 'default' ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) because historical demand samples are limited (5 samples) and no strong recent demand shift or seasonality signal is evident; default keeps forecasts stable while the computed L accounts for longer/more variable lead time and thus increases pipeline coverage to protect service level given high profit vs holding cost (profit $2 vs hold $1).

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_17: on-hand=3, in-transit=268, recent demand samples=[112,97,116,138,94]. Concluded lead_times observed = 1,3,3,3,1,3,1 (avg \u22482.14) \u2014 shows upward, variable lead-time regime with intermittent lost/delayed shipments (many orders unconfirmed for multiple periods). I set L=calculate so backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures the shifted, variable regime). I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this avoids overreacting to short noisy windows while increasing cover for the longer/variable lead time and balancing service level vs holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime shifted upward and variable: concluded lead_times = 1 and multiple 3s \u2192 average observed lead_time \u22482.14 (evidence: concluded lead_times 1 on Periods 2,13,16; 3 on Periods 7,10,12,14).

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:

To capture the observed upward/variable lead-time regime I ask backend to calculate L from observed concluded lead times. Demand forecast and volatility will use defaults ((1+L)\xd7mean of all seed samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to let the OR engine compute base-stock given the inferred L; this is conservative given large in-transit and persistent delivery uncertainty.

Use calculate for L so backend averages observed concluded lead_times (captures upward/variable regime), and default for mu_hat and sigma_hat to scale demand across review+lead using all samples. This balances higher inferred lead time (to cover delayed arrivals) while relying on full-sample demand stats to avoid overreacting to short-term spikes; having the backend increase base stock via larger (1+L) factor helps protect service given many overdue/lost shipments.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_20: on-hand=0, in-transit=321. Historical concluded lead_times = [1,3,3,3,1,3,1,3] \u2192 avg \u22482.25. Multiple orders (Periods 2\u20134 and others) failed to conclude on schedule, indicating delayed/lost shipments and a shifted, variable lead-time regime. To account for this, set L to the calculated average of observed lead times so the OR engine uses empirical lead-time. Demand forecast and volatility will use defaults ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) to keep estimates stable given limited demand history while letting increased L expand protection for pipeline shortfalls.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime shifted upward and become variable: concluded lead_times = 1 and multiple 3s \u2192 average observed lead_time \u22482.25 (evidence: concluded lead_times 1 on Periods 2,13,16; 3 on Periods 7,10,12,14,17).

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 21: on-hand=0, in-transit=265. Historical concluded lead_times show mixed 1s and many 3s (observed sequence: 1,3,3,3,1,3,1,3,3) \u2192 average \u22482.33. Several orders (Periods 2\u20134 and others) exhibited non-conclusions/delays suggesting lost/delayed shipments; pipeline is large so avoid overreacting. I choose L=calculate to let backend use the average of observed lead times (captures the upward/variable regime). For demand, use default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) to anchor forecasts on full historical demand [112,97,116,138,94] while the calculated L inflates the review+lead coverage.

To account for this, set L to be inferred from observed concluded lead times (method=calculate). Demand forecast will use the default aggregation ((1+L)\xd7mean of samples) so the OR backend scales base-stock to the inferred lead time; volatility uses default scaling as well. This keeps forecasting grounded in all historical demand while letting the backend incorporate the empirically observed lead-time average, addressing overdue/in-transit risk without overfitting to recent noise.

LLM Rationale:
Period 23: on-hand=0, in-transit=330. Historical concluded lead_times are variable (1 and multiple 3s) \u2014 evidence of a shifted, longer lead-time regime and some lost/delayed shipments (many orders placed Periods 2\u20134 never concluded). Use 'calculate' for L to let backend average observed concluded lead times (captures upward/variable regime). Demand history (samples [112,97,116,138,94]) shows no clear recent demand break; keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as 'default' so backend uses all samples scaled by (1+L). This balances higher safety stock for longer, variable lead-times while avoiding overfitting to short-term noise; it also acknowledges persistent in-transit volume that may not arrive.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_24: on-hand=40, in-transit=278; recent history shows variable/lengthening lead times (mix of 1,2,3) and several delayed/lost arrivals, plus high intermittent demand spikes (e.g. Period_21 demand=171). To be robust to the variable lead-time regime I set L via 'calculate' so backend averages observed concluded lead times. Demand forecast uses recent_N (N=5) to capture the latest demand regime and recent spikes while weighting recent observations more than long-ago history. Sigma uses default (all-sample std scaled by sqrt(1+L)) so variability across the full history is reflected. This balances higher safety-stock for longer/variable lead times and recent higher demand against holding cost given profit=2 and holding=1.

Period 25: on-hand=0, in-transit=278, recent concluded lead_times show mix of 1 and many 3s (multiple concluded 3-period arrivals), persistent non-conclusions for earlier orders => lead-time regime has shifted upward and become variable. To protect service level given large pipeline uncertainty I set L using recent lead-time observations (recent_N) to capture the upward shift while remaining responsive. Demand history shows elevated recent demands and volatility; use EWMA (gamma=0.3) to weight recent high demand more while smoothing older samples. Keep sigma_hat as default so backend scales uncertainty with chosen L.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime shifted upward and variable: concluded lead_times include 1 and multiple 3s \u2192 average observed lead_time \u22482.2\u20132.5; persistent delayed/non-concluded shipments indicate some lost/delayed shipments; in-transit remains large (~278).

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_26: on-hand=0, in-transit=265, recent concludes show mix of 1-period and multiple 3-period arrivals -> observed average lead_time \u22482.25. Demand history samples = [112,97,116,138,94] (mean=111.4); no strong recent demand regime change. To protect service given prolonged delayed/lost shipments and large pipeline, set L to explicit 2.25 (captures upward/variable lead-time). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample, balancing service level vs holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime shifted upward and variable: concluded lead_times include 1 and multiple 3s \u2192 average observed lead_time \u22482.25 (evidence: concluded lead_times 1 on Period_2, 3 on Periods_7,10,12,14,17, etc.); persistent delayed/non-concluded shipments and large in-transit (265) suggest some lost/delayed shipments.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27: on-hand=0, in-transit=316, demand history seed=[112,97,116,138,94]. Multiple concluded lead_times show a shift upward and variability (observed 1 and several 3s) and many overdue/non-concluded shipments \u2014 average observed lead time is above the promised 2. I choose L=calculate so the backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures the upward/variable regime). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples; this keeps forecasts anchored to historical demand while letting increased L inflate the review+lead demand and safety stock automatically. This balances service (accounting for longer/more variable lead times and large in-transit) against holding cost.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_28. On-hand=0, in-transit=320. Historical concluded lead_times show 1 and many 3s (avg \u22482.2\u20132.5) with persistent non-conclusions \u2192 evidence of longer, variable lead time and some lost/delayed shipments. To be conservative I set L explicit=3 to cover the recent 3-period delays. Demand has trended higher and variable recently; I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat (most recent demands: Periods 23\u201327 = [12,56,59,132,111], mean\u224874) so the review+lead forecast reflects the latest regime and spikes. These settings raise target pipeline to protect service level given delayed arrivals while sigma_hat recent_N captures recent volatility so the OR backend can size safety stock appropriately and cap orders with the provided cap rule.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_29: on-hand=0, in-transit=334, recent history shows concluded lead_times = mix of 1s and many 3s (volatile but shifted upward). Persistent non-conclusions for some earlier orders indicate lost/delayed shipments and a longer effective lead-time than the promised 2. To avoid stockouts given large pipeline uncertainty, I set L by averaging recent observed lead_times (recent_N) to capture the shifted regime while keeping mu_hat/sigma_hat as default so the OR engine uses full demand history scaled by (1+L). This increases target pipeline to cover the longer/variable lead-time while letting the backend compute safety stock from historical demand variability.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime shifted upward and become variable: concluded lead_times include multiple 3s and occasional 1s \u2192 average observed lead_time \u22482.2\u20132.3; persistent delayed/non-concluded shipments indicating some lost/delayed orders (evidence: concluded lead_times 1 at Periods 2,13,16,28 and 3 at Periods 7,10,12,14,17,20,25; many early orders never concluded).

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 30: on-hand=0, in-transit=316. History shows variable concluded lead_times (1,2,3) and many delayed/non-concluded shipments -> actual lead time appears higher and variable. Use 'calculate' for L to let backend average observed concluded lead_times. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so demand scaling uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of provided samples, keeping forecasts anchored to full-sample demand while accounting for inferred lead-time.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_31: on-hand=0, in-transit=334; recent concludes show multiple 3-period arrivals interspersed with occasional 1-period arrivals \u2192 lead-time regime is elevated and variable with evidence of lost/delayed shipments. Choose L.method="calculate" so backend uses observed concluded lead_times average (captures recent shift toward 3s). Demand has been volatile and recent high; use EWMA_gamma (gamma=0.3) for mu_hat to weight recent demand more while retaining historical info. Keep sigma_hat as default so backend scales volatility with chosen L. These choices hedge stock against stretched/variable lead times and recent demand spikes while letting OR engine cap orders via its safety-cap rule.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_32: on-hand=0, in-transit=345. Historical concluded lead_times show mix of 1 and many 3s (multiple concluded 3s across history), implying a higher and variable actual lead time (~2.2\u20132.5). Many earlier orders never concluded on-time -> evidence of lost/delayed shipments and elevated pipeline. Choose L by averaging observed lead times to reflect variable regime and missing arrivals. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes demand over (1+L) periods from full sample statistics; this balances service level upward while letting the backend cap orders to limit exposure to large in-transit and holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime shifted upward and variable; average observed lead_time \u22482.2\u20132.5 (evidence: multiple concluded lead_time=3 across periods and occasional 1s). Persistent delayed/non-concluded shipments; in-transit large (345).

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33: on-hand=0, in-transit=345. History shows variable actual lead times (1 and multiple 3s) and many overdue/non-concluded shipments; observed regime has shifted upward and variable. I choose L.method='calculate' so backend uses the average of observed concluded lead_times (captures recent 1s and multiple 3s). Demand history small but stable sample provided; use mu_hat.method='default' and sigma_hat.method='default' so backend scales mean/std by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L) respectively given the inferred L. This keeps forecasting anchored to full-sample demand while letting the backend adjust for the empirically inferred lead time to balance service level vs holding cost amid delayed/lost shipments.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:

Recent history shows variable but elevated actual lead times (concluded lead_times include multiple 3s and some 1s \u2192 average \u22482.2\u20132.5) and many orders that never concluded (persistent lost/delayed shipments). On-hand=6, in-transit=334 \u2014 pipeline is large but contains unresolved shipments, so use observed lead-time average rather than the promised value. Set L to be calculated from observed concluded lead times to capture the current variable/longer regime. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) so the OR engine computes demand across review+lead from full sample set and balances profit vs. holding cost given the chosen L.

For demand parameters use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full demand history; this balances service level (cover longer recent lead times) against holding cost given large in-transit inventory and high demand variability.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38: on-hand=0, in-transit=334. Concluded lead-times have trended higher and variable (multiple 3-period conclusions and occasional 1s); persistent delayed/non-concluded shipments indicate partial losses. To be conservative versus promised L=2, I set L explicit=2.25 to reflect the observed ~2.2\u20132.5 average and variability. For demand parameters I use default estimators so the OR engine computes mu_hat and sigma_hat from all historical demand samples scaled by (1+L). This raises target pipeline to better cover the longer/more variable lead time while leveraging the backend's statistical safety-stock calculation.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period: 39. On-hand=0, in-transit=334 \u2192 significant pipeline but many past orders showed delayed/lost behaviour. Historical concluded lead_times show frequent 3-period arrivals with occasional 1s (multiple concluded 3s vs occasional 1), implying a higher/variable actual lead time than the promised 2. To hedge service given large in-transit and variable arrivals, set L method to 'calculate' so backend uses observed lead-time average from concluded messages. Use default demand estimates (mu_hat and sigma_hat) so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples \u2014 conservative given limited explicit demand sample set provided. This balances higher safety stock from longer inferred L against holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime has shifted upward and become variable; observed concluded lead_times include many 3-periods and occasional 1s \u2192 average observed lead_time \u22482.2\u20132.5 (evidence: multiple concluded lead_time=3 across periods and occasional 1s); persistent delayed/non-concluded shipments indicate some lost/delayed orders; in-transit remains large (~334).

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40: on-hand=0, in-transit=334, profits $2/ unit, holding $1/unit. History shows a clear shift from promised L=2 to longer/variable actual lead times (many concluded lead_time=3 and occasional 1 \u2192 average \u22482.2\u20132.5) and multiple un-concluded shipments => effective lead time longer and uncertain. I choose L='calculate' so backend uses the average of observed concluded lead times (captures the upward/variable regime). For demand parameters I choose 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend uses (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std of all samples \u2014 conservative aggregate estimates given irregular arrivals and large in-transit stock. This balances service level (by increasing lead-time estimate) vs holding cost conservatively without overfitting noisy recent periods.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 41: on-hand=0, in-transit=334; history shows frequent 3-period arrivals and occasional 1-periods with many lost/delayed shipments, so effective lead time appears longer and variable. To protect service level against delayed arrivals I set L explicit=3 (conservative above promised 2). Demand forecast uses default aggregation so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) to leverage full historical sample base; sigma_hat uses default to scale historical volatility by sqrt(1+L). This increases planned pipeline to cover the longer/variable lead-time regime while letting the OR backend compute safety stock tradeoff given profit/holding costs.

Historical concluded lead_times show occasional 1s and many 3s \u2192 average observed lead_time > promised (\u22482.2\u20132.5) and persistent delayed/lost shipments. Use 'calculate' for L to let the backend average observed lead times from concludes. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) because demand samples (112,97,116,138,94) show no clear recent regime shift and we want the base-stock to reflect the longer, variable lead time while keeping volatility estimated from full history.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_43: on-hand=0, in-transit=395, recent concluded lead_times show multiple 3-period arrivals and occasional 1-period arrivals => upward, variable lead-time regime and evidence of lost/delayed shipments. Demand context: chips(Regular) historically sampled (seed) demands [112,97,116,138,94]; recent realized demands in many periods are volatile and often large, causing frequent stockouts. I select L.method="calculate" so the backend infers the observed average lead time from concluded messages (captures the upward/variable regime from history). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I select "default" so the backend uses (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std of the seed samples\u2014this keeps forecasts grounded in the historical demand seed while letting the calculated L expand the review+lead horizon to protect against the longer observed lead times and high in-transit exposure. This balances service (larger base stock when calculated L>promised) versus holding cost given the high in-transit volume and evidence of lost/delayed shipments.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime has shifted upward and become variable; average observed lead_time \u22482.2\u20132.5 based on multiple concluded 3-period arrivals and occasional 1-periods. Persistent delayed/non-concluded shipments indicate some lost/delayed orders; in-transit currently large (395).

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================

To reflect this, infer lead time from observed concludes (robust to variability) and keep demand estimates broad using full-sample defaults so the OR engine increases coverage without overfitting recent noise. Methods: L set to 'calculate' to use the average of observed lead_times; mu_hat and sigma_hat set to 'default' so (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std use all samples and widen safety stock for the longer/variable lead time and outstanding in-transit inventory.

To guard against delayed/lost shipments I set lead time explicitly to 3 (conservative). I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples using the chosen L=3; this raises target base-stock and safety stock to improve service while accepting higher holding cost given frequent delays.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46: on-hand=0, in-transit=393. Historical concluded lead_times show many 3-period arrivals recently with occasional 1s (recent concluded lead_times used: Periods 14,16,17,20,23,25,28,29,33,44 \u2192 average \u22482.2). Persistent lost/delayed shipments in earlier windows increased in-transit but recent concludes imply a shifted, variable lead-time regime (~2.2). I set L using recent_N (N=10) to capture the recent mixture of 1s/2s/3s. Demand samples mean=111.4; using default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) keeps the OR engine's forecast tied to long-run demand while the larger observed pipeline (393) provides cover for near-term service despite lost shipments. This balances service level (accounting for longer/variable lead time) against holding cost given current large in-transit volume.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47: on-hand=0, in-transit=393, recent demand history high and volatile (historical samples [112,97,116,138,94], mean=111.4). Concluded lead_times from history show many 3-period arrivals and occasional 1\u20132s (sampled concluded lead_times average \u22482.2). Several past orders have been delayed or lost (large persistent in-transit and many non-conclusions), so actual lead time is reliably above the promised 2 and variable. I set L to 'calculate' so the backend uses the empirical average of observed concluded lead times (captures the ~2.2 regime). For demand parameters I use 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend scales the historical mean and std by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L) respectively\u2014this leverages all samples to produce a conservative base stock given elevated effective lead time and large in-transit. This balances service (avoid stockouts given delays) against holding cost by increasing coverage only to the level justified by observed lead-time regime.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_48: on-hand=0, in-transit=393. Historical conclues show many concluded lead_times=3 with occasional 1s and numerous non-concluded orders \u2192 evidence of upward, variable lead-time regime and some lost/delayed shipments. To be conservative and ensure pipeline covers demand + delayed arrivals, I set L explicitly to 3 (plan for 3-period lead time). With L=3 I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand history \u2014 this leverages full-sample demand estimates while the explicit longer L increases safety stock to offset delayed/lost shipments and high in-transit volume.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime shifted upward and become variable: multiple concluded 3-period arrivals and occasional 1-periods \u2192 average observed lead_time \u22482.2\u20132.5; persistent delayed/non-concluded shipments indicate some lost/delayed orders; in-transit currently large (393).

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_49 decision: on-hand=0, in-transit=334, recent history shows concluded lead_times mostly 3 with occasional 1s \u2192 average observed lead_time > promised. Many early orders never concluded (persistent lost/delayed shipments). To let OR engine infer mean lead time from observed concludes while using its demand formulas, set L='calculate' (use observed lead_times). Demand samples are limited but stable (historical mean=111.4); use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This balances raising pipeline cover via higher L while keeping demand estimate anchored to all samples given no clear recent demand regime shift.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime shifted upward and become variable: concluded lead_times include many 3-periods and occasional 1-periods \u2192 average observed lead_time \u22482.2\u20132.5; persistent delayed/non-concluded shipments indicate some lost/delayed orders (evidence: many conclude messages show arrived=0 for early orders and multiple concluded lead_time=3 entries).

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:

Numerous concluded arrivals show frequent 3-period lead times with occasional 1-periods; average observed lead_time \u22482.2\u20132.3 and many early orders never concluded (lost/delayed). To account for the persistent upward and variable lead-time regime and large pipeline, set L explicitly to 2.25. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend scales demand stats by (1+L) with full-sample mean/std, letting the OR engine compute base-stock and cap while accounting for the longer effective lead time.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime shifted upward and variable: multiple concluded lead_time=3 and occasional 1 \u2192 average observed lead_time \u22482.2\u20132.5 (evidence: many conclude messages showing lead_time=3 across periods 7,10,12,14,17,20,25, etc.; occasional 1 at periods 2,13,16,28). Persistent delayed/non-concluded shipments; large in-transit (~334).
