Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start: no on-hand, no in-transit, no concluded arrivals yet. Promised lead time = 4; no evidence of lost or shorter/longer lead times (no conclude messages). Historical demand samples available (mean \u2248 111.4). Use default lead time and default demand/volatility aggregation so OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample set. This keeps policy conservative to cover (L+1) periods of demand given current uncertainty and balances $2 profit vs $1 holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
On-hand=0, in-transit=141 (order placed in Period 1, arrived=0 in Period 1 conclude). No concluded arrivals observed so actual lead time cannot be inferred \u2014 use promised lead time. Historical demand samples = [112,97,116,138,94]; no clear recent regime change. Use default methods so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std to set base-stock and cap given promised L=4.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3 decision with no on-hand and 278 in-transit (141+137). Two prior orders (Period1, Period2) concluded with arrived=0; no concluded arrivals yet so actual lead time is unconfirmed. Promised lead time remains the default (4). Use default demand estimates: mu_hat and sigma_hat computed from all historical samples [112,97,116,138,94] with (1+L) scaling to cover current review+lead period. This keeps the OR engine anchored to the historical mean (no strong evidence of demand regime shift) while the pipeline shortfall / possible delays will be monitored in subsequent conclude messages.

Carry-over insight: Possible shipment delays: Period1 ordered=141 and Period2 ordered=137 both concluded with arrived=0 and are currently in-transit=278; monitor for lost shipments if arrivals fail to conclude after promised lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
No concluded arrivals yet for recent orders but promised lead time (4) not yet exceeded\u2014no confirmed lost shipments. Demand history (past samples) shows mean ~111.4 and moderate variability. Use default lead time (promised) and default demand/volatility calculations so OR backend applies (1+L) scaling consistently. This balances service (use promised L) while avoiding overreacting to unconfirmed delays; holding cost moderate so keep defaults rather than inflating safety stock prematurely.

Carry-over insight: Possible shipment delays: Period1 ordered=141 and Period2 ordered=137 and Period3 ordered=136 concluded with arrived=0 and remain in-transit (total in-transit=414); monitor for arrivals after promised lead time\u2014flag for potential lost shipments if they fail to conclude after L periods.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_5: on-hand=0, in-transit=549. Historical demand samples: [112,97,116,138,94], mean=111.4. Promised lead time=4 and observed concludes so far show ordered arrivals=0 but these orders are not yet past the promised arrival window (orders placed in early periods would conclude visibility after Period 5). To avoid overreacting to unresolved in-transit shipments, use the promised lead time and full-sample demand estimates so the backend's base-stock balances service level vs holding cost using established stats. Chosen methods: L=default (use promised L=4), mu_hat=default ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples \u22485\xd7111.4=557), sigma_hat=default (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples). This keeps coverage for the review+lead period while avoiding premature increases to forecasts that would raise holding costs given current zero on-hand but large pipeline.

Daily Profit: $176.00, Daily Holding Cost: $53.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $123.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
One Period-1 order concluded in Period-5 with arrived=141 (ordered Period-1, lead_time=4), confirming actual lead time = 4 periods so far. Multiple subsequent orders remain in-transit (408) while on-hand=53; monitor for lost shipments if they fail to conclude after 4 periods. Given no strong demand regime shift in provided historical samples, use default demand/volatility calculations so OR backend uses full-sample mean/std scaled by (1+L). This balances service level (use promised lead time) vs. holding cost conservatively while we await confirmations of other in-transit arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods based on Period-5 conclude: arrived=141 (ordered Period-1, lead_time=4).

Daily Reward (R_t): $62.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
On-hand=106, in-transit=342. Recent concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (Period-5 conclude: arrived=141 ordered P1, W=4; Period-6 conclude: arrived=137 ordered P2, W=4). Several earlier orders showed delayed arrivals but now two orders concluded with W=4 so use promised/observed L=4. Demand history (samples [112,97,116,138,94]) shows no clear recent regime shift; use default demand aggregation to cover review+lead horizon. Choose default L to trust confirmed lead time, default mu_hat to set (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) ensuring coverage for L+1 periods, and default sigma_hat to reflect historical volatility across the same horizon. This balances service level (covering 5 periods of demand given confirmed L) against holding cost, while flagged in-transit stock covers near-term demand until newer arrivals are observed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $37.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8: confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods from conclude messages (Period5: arrived=141 ordered P1 LT=4; Period6: arrived=137 ordered P2 LT=4; Period7: arrived=136 ordered P3 LT=4). Current on-hand=149, in-transit=281. Historical demand samples = [112,97,116,138,94] (mean=111.4). Use promised/default lead time to match observed LT and OR backend expectations, and default demand/volatility computations to let OR engine compute base_stock and caps consistently given stable recent demand and confirmed LT. This balances service level (satisfy upcoming (L+1) periods) against holding cost while avoiding ad-hoc explicit forecasts given no calendar shocks.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 status: on-hand=147, in-transit=235. Historical demand samples = [112,97,116,138,94] (mean=111.4). Concluded arrivals establish actual lead time = 4 periods (Period 5 conclude: ordered P1 arrived, lead_time=4; subsequent concludes for P2\u2013P4 also show 4). No strong recent demand regime change detected. To keep parameters consistent with confirmed lead time and the full sample demand history, use default calculations so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This balances service-level (use confirmed L=4) with holding cost by relying on historical mean/variance rather than overreacting to prior delayed-but-arrived shipments.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (evidence: Period 5 conclude: arrived=141 ordered on Period 1, lead_time=4; Periods 6\u20138 concludes corroborate 4-period lead time).

Daily Reward (R_t): $87.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10: on-hand=69, in-transit=373. Historical demand samples [112,97,116,138,94] show stable mean (~111.4) and variance. Multiple concluded messages (Periods 5\u20138) confirm actual lead time = 4 periods. Some recent arrivals (Period 9 conclude: arrived=0) are still in-transit but no new evidence of lost shipments beyond prior resolved delays. Set L by calculating observed lead times (use observed data to confirm 4). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample set, which leverages full-history demand estimates and the confirmed 4-period lead time to balance service level versus holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (evidence: Period 5 conclude: arrived=141 ordered on Period 1, lead_time=4; Periods 6\u20138 concludes corroborate 4-period lead time).

Daily Reward (R_t): $232.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 11. Recent concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple arrivals from orders placed in Periods 1\u20136 all had lead_time=4). On-hand=16, in-transit=387; no new lost-shipment signal. I set L via 'calculate' to reflect observed lead times (average of observed = 4). Demand history (samples [112,97,116,138,94]) has no clear regime shift; use default forecasting: mu_hat=(1+L)\xd7mean(all samples)=5\xd7111.4 and sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples). These parameters align the OR backend with confirmed lead time and historical demand so orders will cover the review+lead period while balancing profit vs. holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods based on multiple concludes (e.g., Period 5 arrived=141 ordered Period 1, lead_time=4; subsequent concludes for Periods 6\u201310 corroborate 4-period lead time).

Daily Reward (R_t): $83.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_12: demand history shows samples [112,97,116,138,94] (mean=111.4). Concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4 (multiple conclude messages corroborating 4-period actual lead time); on-hand=33 and in-transit=443 (several prior large orders are en route but arriving with 4-period lag). To capture the observed lead-time regime I set L=calculate (average observed lead times = 4). For demand across review+lead I use default so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) to reflect long lead horizon and full sample mean (stable recent pattern). For volatility I use default so sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples). These choices align the OR backend with the confirmed 4-period lead time, keep the target service level driven by current profit/holding tradeoff, and avoid overreacting to recent single-period demand noise while acknowledging substantial pipeline inventory.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods. On-hand=30, in-transit=400. Historical sample mean=111.4 (samples=[112,97,116,138,94]) so (1+L)*mean=5*111.4=557 expected demand over review+lead. I use default L (promised=4) and default demand statistics to let the OR engine compute base_stock from full-sample mean/STD; this leverages confirmed lead-time regime and the full-history demand estimate while keeping estimates stable given limited samples.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Context: Period 14. Confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods from multiple concludes. Current inventory: on-hand=64, in-transit=351 (total pipeline=415). Recent demand shows a modest uptick and variability; last 5 period demands = [78,124,58,92,104] \u2192 recent mean \u224891.2. (L+1)=5 period demand \u2248456, so pipeline+on-hand slightly undercovers the next 5 periods \u2014 justify using recent demand stats to set forecast and volatility. Decisions: keep L at promised/default (4) because concludes consistently show 4; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture recent regime and higher variance. This balances service level (avoid stockouts given shortfall) vs holding cost by adapting to recent demand rather than older samples.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_15: demand history stable with samples [112,97,116,138,94]; recent concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple concluded arrivals matched orders placed 4 periods earlier). On-hand=34, in-transit=332; some large pipeline but arrivals have been arriving with 4-period lag. Use default lead time (promised=4, confirmed by concludes). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7sample mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7sample std from all samples\u2014this leverages full sample set given no strong recent demand regime change. This balances service (profit $2 vs holding $1) by letting OR engine set base stock from empirical mean/variance while respecting observed 4-period lead time and existing pipeline.

Demand history (seed samples) used by backend; no strong recent demand regime change evident. Given confirmed lead time = promised lead time and stable demand, use defaults so OR backend computes base_stock from full-sample mean/variance. This keeps parameters aligned with observed 4-period lead time and lets the OR engine balance service level vs holding cost using established statistics. Current pipeline + on-hand provides multi-period coverage but OR will cap orders; no new carry-over insight.

No new missing shipments beyond confirmed 4-period lead time. Demand history (samples=[112,97,116,138,94]) shows no recent regime shift. I set L via calculate to reflect observed lead time=4 from concludes. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, keeping forecasts anchored to historical demand while accounting for the 4-period lead time and balancing service-level vs holding cost.

Period 18: on-hand=115, in-transit=399. Historical concludes consistently confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple Period concludes showing ordered\u2192arrived with lead_time=4). Several earlier shipments were delayed but concluded, so no new lost-shipment evidence. I choose L=default to use promised lead time (matches observed 4). Demand parameters use defaults so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples), which leverages full historical demand (samples=[112,97,116,138,94]) to cover the (L+1) review+lead horizon and let the OR backend compute safety stock vs. holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Current period 19. Recent concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods; inventory on-hand=94, in-transit=333. Historical demand samples (provided) used as baseline; no strong recent demand regime change detected. Using promised/default lead time keeps OR engine aligned with supplier promise (and matches observed actual L=4). Default mu_hat and sigma_hat (i.e., (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) provide a stable forecast and volatility estimate to balance service level vs holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1. On-hand + in-transit currently covers several periods of demand, so no aggressive upward adjustment needed; defaults avoid overstock while maintaining service given 4-period lead time.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 20: demand history stable (samples [112,97,116,138,94]); on-hand=188, in-transit=272. Multiple concluded messages confirm actual lead time = 4 periods and arrivals have been regular since Period 5. No clear recent changepoint in demand or lead time. I choose default for L to use promised lead time (=4) consistent with observed concludes. I choose default for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend uses (1+L)\xd7sample mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7sample std to compute base-stock and cap \u2014 this balances service level (profit>holding cost) while avoiding aggressive overstock given moderate on-hand + in-transit. Monitoring overdue in-transit shipments continues but no explicit adjustment needed now.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Inventory high (on-hand=243, in-transit=168). Historical demand samples = [112,97,116,138,94], mean=111.4. Multiple conclude messages consistently confirm actual lead time = 4 periods. With profit=2 and holding=1, use default lead time and default demand stats so OR backend computes base_stock = (1+L)*mean and volatility from full sample; this avoids overfitting to recent low/high draws while the pipeline is healthy and holding costs matter.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods based on repeated concludes (arrivals for orders placed Periods 1\u201316 consistently showing lead_time=4).

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_22: no new calendar events. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (orders placed Periods 1\u201317 concluded with lead_time=4). Current inventory: on-hand=131, in-transit=188; some in-transit units were previously delayed but recent concludes confirm L=4 rather than lost shipments. I choose L=default (use promised lead time = 4 backed by repeated concludes). Demand history seed is small (samples provided); use mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this yields a conservative forecast and volatility estimate the optimizer expects. Monitoring: keep watch for any future absent concludes beyond 4 periods (would trigger explicit L change). These settings let the OR backend compute base-stock balancing profit ($2) vs holding cost ($1) automatically.

Use observed lead time to size pipeline for (L+1) periods of demand; default demand statistics (all samples) are still representative (no strong recent demand shift).

Demand history (seed) = [112,97,116,138,94] \u2192 mean=111.4. Given confirmed LT=4, use calculate for L to reflect observed lead time; use default demand/volatility scaling so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_all and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std_all. This keeps the OR backend anchored to the validated 4-period lead time and the full-sample demand statistics, balancing service level (using all available demand history) against holding cost while current on-hand + pipeline (433 total) appears sufficient short-term.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 27: demand history steady (samples [112,97,116,138,94]) and game history shows consistent concluded arrivals with lead_time=4 across many periods. On-hand=163, in-transit=182; no evidence of recent lost shipments. Use promised/default lead time to match observed actual L=4. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_29: on-hand=0, in-transit=356. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple confirms through Period 28). Demand samples = [112,97,116,138,94], mean=111.4. Given strong, repeated evidence of 4-period lead time and no recent demand regime shift, use promised/default lead time and default demand/volatility aggregations so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This keeps parameters stable, leverages full history, and lets the backend balance service level vs holding cost while accounting for the 4-period review+lead horizon. Monitor outstanding in-transit=356 for expected arrivals in upcoming concludes.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_30: on-hand=0, in-transit=450. Demand history shows recent volatility but no clear regime shift; multiple concludes consistently confirm actual lead time = 4 periods. Orders placed earlier have been arriving with 4-period lead time. To keep backend aligned with observed reality and avoid overfitting to short-term noise, use default lead time (promised) which matches observed actual lead time, and default demand/volatility calculations so OR engine uses full-sample stats scaled by (1+L). This balances service level (use observed L=4) against holding cost given current sizable in-transit inventory.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained actual lead time = 4 periods based on repeated concludes (arrivals for orders placed across Periods 1\u201325 consistently show lead_time=4).

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31: on-hand=0, in-transit=451. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (many corroborating arrivals), so use promised/default lead time. Demand history (samples provided) and no strong recent regime shift observed in demand mean/variance, so use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples). This keeps the OR engine aligned with confirmed lead time and historical demand while avoiding overreacting to transient arrival variability. Parameters ensure pipeline + on-hand targets coverage for L+1 periods given profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32: on-hand=0, in-transit=363. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple Period conclude messages across Periods 5\u201331). No new demand regime or seasonality signals; recent arrivals confirm reliable L=4. I choose L by 'calculate' (average observed lead times = 4) to reflect confirmed actual lead time. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use 'default' so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, ensuring the base-stock accounts for one review + lead period of demand given confirmed L. This balances service level (uses full-sample stats) against holding cost while acknowledging current in-transit stock.

Demand history samples = [112,97,116,138,94] (mean=111.4). I set L using 'calculate' to let backend use observed lead times (confirmed=4). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use 'default' so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, giving a balanced base-stock that reflects the 4-period lead time and observed demand variability while controlling holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

With L=4, (1+L)*mean=5*111.4=557 expected demand over review+lead; current inventory+pipeline=501, slightly below that forecast. I use the default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR engine computes base_stock = (1+L)*mean and default volatility; this aligns with observed consistent 4-period lead time and lets the backend balance service level vs holding cost automatically.

Use promised lead time (default) to keep OR engine aligned with supplier promise. Demand history shows no recent regime shift vs. seed samples, so use default demand/volatility calculations ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to let backend compute base_stock and cap.

Actual lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods across many concludes; promised lead time = 4. Current inventory: on-hand=221, in-transit=182. Given stable demand history and confirmed 4-period lead time, use default settings so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using full sample set; this balances service level (profit $2 vs holding $1) without overfitting short-term noise.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 38. On-hand=215, in-transit=248. Historical concludes consistently confirm actual lead time = 4 periods; no new lost-shipment signals. Recent demand has shifted and is volatile: last 5 demands = [5, 18, 144, 92, 32], suggesting a new short-run regime. I set L to default (promised=4) because multiple concludes corroborate a stable 4-period lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the current regime; (1+L) scaling will let the OR backend target service for the 5-period review+lead horizon. I also use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat so variability reflects the high recent volatility. This balances service (avoid stockouts after a recent high demand) against holding costs given on-hand + in-transit stock is already high.

No evidence of lost shipments currently. Demand context: baseline sample set provided; no clear recent regime shift. I choose L=default to trust the promised lead time (matches observed actual L=4). I choose mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of available demand samples\u2014conservative approach given stable lead-time evidence and lack of clear demand changepoint.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_40: historical concludes consistently confirm actual lead time = 4 periods. Current position: on-hand=90, in-transit=369. Use promised/default lead time to match observed regime and avoid overreacting to transient pipeline fluctuations. Select default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from provided demand samples, which balances service (profit=$2 vs holding=$1) using the OR engine's target quantile.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41: on-hand=102, in-transit=242. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple orders across Periods 1\u201336 concluded with lead_time=4). No recent evidence of lost shipments. Use promised lead time to align with observed stability. Demand sample set provided (past demands [112,97,116,138,94]) will be used with default aggregation to let OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This balances service (using confirmed L=4) vs holding cost by letting backend compute the base stock and cap given profit/holding cost.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_42: confirmed sustained actual lead time = 4 periods from multiple concluded arrivals; recent on-hand=105, in-transit=294. Historical sample demands = [112,97,116,138,94] (mean ~111.4). Given consistent 4-period lead time and no new calendar events, use default estimators so OR backend applies (1+L) demand aggregation and volatility scaling. This keeps ordering aligned with proven lead-time regime and balances service level vs. holding cost using the backend's base-stock calculation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $123.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_43. On-hand=29, in-transit=383. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (arrivals in Periods 5\u201342 confirm 4-period lead times). Pipeline is large vs current on-hand so I will use the promised/default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR engine (which uses historical demand stats) can compute base stock; this avoids overfitting short-term noise while accounting for sustained LT=4 signal. Defaults balance service level vs holding cost given long confirmed LT and sizable pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained actual lead time = 4 periods based on repeated concludes through Period_42 (arrivals for orders placed across Periods 1\u201338 consistently show lead_time=4).

Daily Reward (R_t): $25.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44: confirmed sustained actual lead time = 4 periods from conclude history; demand has been volatile but no clear recent regime shift. On-hand=95, in-transit=331 -> pipeline + on-hand covers multiple periods but some recent arrivals were 0 then later arrived consistent with 4-period lead time. Use default lead time (promised=4) to match confirmed actuals and let backend compute demand forecast from full sample history ((1+L)\xd7mean) and volatility (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This balances service (profit $2 vs holding $1) by relying on backend's base-stock calculation using full-history statistics rather than risking overreaction to short-term noise.

Use promised/confirmed L=4 (default) so backend uses (1+L) demand aggregation. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the provided demand samples. This keeps parameters aligned with observed 4-period lead time and balances service level vs holding cost given current pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-107.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_47: demand history shows no structural shift; past concludes consistently confirm actual lead time = 4 periods. Current on-hand=143 and in-transit=323 provide coverage vs. expected demand; no overdue/lost shipments signaled beyond previously observed confirms. I set L to default (promised lead time=4) because concluded arrivals repeatedly show lead_time=4. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to default so the OR backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all historical demand samples, which balances service level and holding cost given stable demand and confirmed lead time.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained actual lead time = 4 periods through Period_46 (evidence: multiple concludes including Period_5 arrival=141 ordered P1 lead_time=4 and subsequent concludes up to Period_46 showing arrivals with lead_time=4).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-145.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_48: demand history (samples [112,97,116,138,94]) shows no recent structural demand shift; multiple concludes through Period_47 consistently confirm actual lead time = 4 periods. Current inventory: on-hand=193, in-transit=261. With L=4 confirmed, using default demand aggregation ((1+L)\xd7mean) and default volatility (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) keeps the OR engine aligned with observed 4-period lead time and historical demand, balancing service level against holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained actual lead time = 4 periods based on repeated concludes through Period_47 (e.g., Period_5 arrival=141 ordered P1 lead_time=4 and subsequent concludes up to Period_47 showing arrivals with lead_time=4).

Historical demand baseline (samples provided) and no new calendar/news drivers -> use promised/default lead time and population moments.
