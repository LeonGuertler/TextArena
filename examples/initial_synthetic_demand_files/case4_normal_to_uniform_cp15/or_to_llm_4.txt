Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: confirmed L=0 from carry-over insight and many concluded messages showing same-period arrivals. Inventory & pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=0 so no coverage for current-period demand. Demand analysis: OR's capped baseline =129 units, which targets a single-period cover given recent high realized demands (e.g., Periods 48\u201349 demands 192 and 182, many past periods near 120\u2013130) while using historical mean/variance; profit/holding cost (q=4/(4+1)=0.8) implies a meaningful safety-stock. Timing: with L=0 an order placed now will arrive during this period and can satisfy Period 50 demand. Decision: accept OR's recommendation of 129 units to balance service (avoid stockout given frequent >110 demand spikes) against holding cost; ordering 129 from zero inventory provides immediate coverage without excessive overstock given variability. Final action: order 129 units.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Followed OR's 129-unit recommendation: lead time is confirmed 0 so order arrives this period, on-hand is 0, and recent demands often exceed 110\u2013120 so 129 balances service and holding cost.",
