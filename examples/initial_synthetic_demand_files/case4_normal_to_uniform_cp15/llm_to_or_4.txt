Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start: no on-hand or in-transit; no concluded arrivals to infer lead time. Historical demand samples = [112,97,116,138,94] (mean=111.4, std\u224815.74). Promised lead time=0 and no evidence to adjust. Use default (all-sample) estimates so OR backend uses stable demand seed: L=promised(0); mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all)=111.4; sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all)=15.744. This balances service (using full-sample mean) vs holding cost conservatively given no news or overdue shipments.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date Period_2. On-hand=12, in-transit=0. Last period's order (Period 1) arrived same period (arrived=119, lead_time=0). No evidence of lost shipments or lead-time drift. Historical demands = [112,97,116,138,94], mean=111.4, sample std\u224817.603. Use default methods (promised lead time and demand stats) so OR backend uses full-sample estimates and maintains service given current variability while avoiding extra holding cost.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent concluded arrivals show actual lead_time=0 (orders placed in P1,P2 arrived same period). No calendar events; demand history stable (samples: [112,97,116,138,94], mean=111.4, sd\u224817.61). On-hand=2, in-transit=0 so we need replenishment to cover expected demand. Set L to calculated average lead time (0). Use default demand aggregation: mu_hat=(1+L)*mean_all=111.4 to target one-period demand; sigma_hat= sqrt(1+L)*std_all \u224817.61 to capture observed volatility. These settings align the OR base-stock to recent realized lead-time and historical demand, balancing service level (profit>holding so higher fill) against holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $74.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Period 4; on-hand=54, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead-times (Periods 1\u20133) show arrivals the same period as orders (lead_time=0 each), so actual lead time is 0. Demand history (five samples) has mean 111.4 and std ~15.74. With promised L=0 and confirmed actual L=0, I use default estimators: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean captures expected one-period demand (~111.4), sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std captures demand variability. This addresses the inventory shortfall (on-hand 54 << expected single-period demand ~111) so the OR backend's base-stock policy will replenish toward the target while balancing profit ($2) vs holding cost ($1) via its q-derived safety factor.

Daily Reward (R_t): $161.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date Period_5. All concluded arrivals (Periods 1\u20134) show lead_time=0 \u2014 consistent same-day arrivals. On-hand=23, in-transit=0, while average demand (historical samples) is ~111 units; current inventory is well below expected demand for the review+lead window, so we should replenish to cover expected demand. I set L by averaging observed lead times (calculate \u2192 0). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to defaults using all historical samples (mu_hat=(1+L)*mean_samples=111.4; sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std_samples\u224815.74). These params give the OR backend a base-stock anchored to the long-run mean and measured volatility, which balances the $2 profit vs $1 holding cost by targeting the critical fractile implicit in the backend while avoiding overstating lead time given consistent zero lead times observed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $151.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period Period_6. Recent concluded history shows consistent same-period arrivals (observed lead_time=0 across concluded periods). On-hand=25, in-transit=0 while typical period demand ~111 units -> risk of stockout this period if no order placed. I choose to trust observed lead time=0 (so orders would arrive same period) and set demand forecast based on historical sample mean to provide the OR backend a conventional base-stock input.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 consistently; set L to calculated average (0). Recent demand has softened (last 3 demands 92,88,84 \u2192 mean 88), so use recent_N=3 for mu_hat to capture the downward shift while avoiding overreaction to one period. Use recent_N=3 for sigma_hat to reflect lower recent volatility (std of [92,88,84] \u2248 3.266). These choices keep base_stock responsive to the recent lower demand and maintain low holding cost given profit=2 vs holding=1.

Daily Reward (R_t): $180.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date Period_8. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show every order placed in Periods 1\u20137 arrived with lead_time=0 (no overdue/lost shipments). Demand history (Periods 1\u20137) = [107,116,64,92,88,84,90], mean=91.5714, std\u224816.675. I set L by calculating the average of observed lead times (all concluded = 0) to capture the confirmed same-period arrival behavior. mu_hat uses default: (1+L)*mean of all available demand samples to reflect aggregate demand per review+lead period. sigma_hat uses default: sqrt(1+L)*std of all samples to reflect observed variability. These choices align the OR backend's base-stock with confirmed lead time and recent realized demand, balancing service level (using observed demand mean) against holding cost (no inflation of lead time or safety stock).

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead_time=0 for orders placed in Periods 1\u20137 (arrived same period as ordered); evidence: 'arrived ... lead_time was 0 periods' in Periods 1\u20137 conclude messages.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
History shows consistent same-period arrivals in concluded messages (lead_time=0 for orders placed in Periods 1\u20138). Use actual lead time 0. No strong evidence of demand regime shift; use full-sample defaults. Set L via observed average lead time=0. Set mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) = 111.4 to target average demand. Set sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples) = 15.74 to reflect observed variability. These settings keep the OR base-stock anchored to historical demand while leveraging confirmed zero lead time to avoid extra pipeline cover and reduce holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead_time=0 periods confirmed for orders placed Periods 1\u20138 (evidence: concluded messages showing 'lead_time was 0 periods').

Daily Reward (R_t): $122.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent concluded history (Periods 1\u20139) consistently shows actual lead_time=0; on-hand=34, in-transit=0. Demand has recently been variable; I use a recent-N estimate (last 5 concluded demands Periods 5\u20139 = [88,84,93,137,78]) to capture the current regime. Set L=0 (promised and observed). Set mu_hat=(1+L)*mean_recent = 96.0 to cover this period's demand expectation. Set sigma_hat using recent-N std to reflect elevated volatility (sd \u2248 23.57) so the OR backend raises the base stock moderately to protect service level while balancing holding cost.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_11 decision with on-hand=0 and in-transit=0. Concluded history (Periods 1\u201310) shows orders arriving same period -> actual lead_time=0. Demand samples from Periods 1\u201310 = [107,116,64,92,88,84,93,137,78,124], mean=98.3, sample std\u224821.24. I set L using the average of observed lead times (0). mu_hat uses default (1+L)*mean -> 98.3 to cover current period demand. sigma_hat uses default sqrt(1+L)*std -> 21.24 to capture observed variability. These parameters keep the base-stock near recent mean demand (service-focused given profit>holding) while reflecting low lead time and observed volatility.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date Period_12. Strong, consistent evidence of actual lead_time=0 from concluded messages Periods 1\u201311. On-hand=54, in-transit=0. I choose promised/default lead time (L=0). mu_hat set to default: (1+L)*mean of all observed demands (Periods 1\u201311) \u2192 mean=94.63636 so mu_hat=94.63636. sigma_hat set to default: sqrt(1+L)*std of all observed demands (Periods 1\u201311) \u2192 std=24.48385 so sigma_hat=24.48385. These conservative, data-driven parameters reflect the confirmed same-period arrivals (no pipeline), target the OR engine's base-stock calculation using recent empirical demand mean/volatility, and avoid over-ordering given holding cost = $1 and profit = $2.

=== Period 12 Summary ===

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent concludes (Periods 1\u201312) consistently show arrived = ordered with lead_time = 0. On-hand = 18, in-transit = 0, so there is no pipeline protection vs. expected demand. Use promised/default lead time = 0 (well supported by concluded arrivals). Use default demand estimates from the full sample (mean=111.4, std\u224815.75) scaled by (1+L)=1 to produce mu_hat=111.4 and sigma_hat=15.75. These parameters provide the OR backend with a base-stock targeting the historical mean demand this period while the z* balances profit ($2) vs holding ($1). Given low on-hand and no in-transit, this will generate an order to replenish toward the base stock while avoiding excessive holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead_time=0 periods for orders placed in Periods 1\u201312 (evidence: 'arrived ... lead_time was 0 periods' in Periods 1\u201312 conclude messages).

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent concluded history (Periods 1\u201313) consistently shows actual lead_time=0 for all orders. On-hand=6, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments. Use promised/default lead time 0. Demand prior samples (provided) have mean=111.4 and std=15.743; with L=0 the aggregated (1+L) multipliers leave these values unchanged. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to these defaults provides the OR engine with a stable forecast; given profit $2 and holding $1 (service quantile q=2/(2+1)=0.6667), the backend will target a moderately high base stock balancing stockouts vs holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $220.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_15: no special calendar events. Historical concluded messages through Period_14 consistently show orders arriving same-period (lead_time=0). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must cover current-period demand. I set L=default (promised lead time=0) because concluded history confirms actual lead time=0. For mu_hat/sigma_hat I use default formulas over all observed demand samples (Periods 1\u201314) to capture full-demand variability: mean demand = 96.5714 \u2192 mu_hat=(1+L)*mean = 96.5714. Sample std dev = 22.2977 \u2192 sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std = 22.2977. These parameters keep the base-stock tied to empiric demand and maintain a conservative service level given profit/holding tradeoff, while avoiding extra inventory since lead time is zero and arrivals are reliable.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Context: Period 16 with on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded messages consistently show actual lead_time=0 for all recent orders. Demand samples available: [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] (mean=111.4, std\u224815.74). Decision: use promised/default lead time L=0 because concluded history confirms same-period arrivals. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using defaults to reflect long-run sample stats: mu_hat=(1+L)*mean = 111.4; sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std = 15.74. This yields a moderate service-level target (profit/(profit+holding)=2/3) that balances filling expected demand while limiting holding costs given zero starting inventory and no pipeline.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent concluded history (Periods 1\u201316) consistently shows actual lead_time = 0. On-hand=50, in-transit=0. Use promised/default lead time (0) because arrivals have been immediate and reliable; set demand forecast using all observed demands (Periods 1\u201316) to capture full sample mean/variance. mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) = 95.5 units to target average period demand; sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples) = 23.36 to reflect observed volatility. These parameters balance service (high fill due to immediate arrivals) against holding cost by using the empirical mean and observed variability rather than inflating for longer lead times.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent concludes (Periods 1\u201317) consistently show arrived orders with lead_time=0. On-hand=104, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. I use default (promised) lead time since empirical concludes confirm L=0. Demand history (Periods 1\u201317) mean = 90.4118 and sample std = 31.359, so using default formulas: mu_hat=(1+L)*mean and sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std. This yields a base-stock sized to cover typical single-period demand while containing holding costs given high holding cost relative to profit.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current on-hand=22, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead_time=0 (orders in Periods 1\u201318 arrived same period). No evidence of lost shipments or lead-time drift. Use promised/default lead time (L=0). Demand baseline: use full-sample mean of provided historical demand data (mean=111.4) scaled by (1+L) \u2192 mu_hat=111.4. Use population std of samples (std\u224815.74) scaled by sqrt(1+L) \u2192 sigma_hat=15.74. These conservative defaults keep target base-stock centered on observed demand while holding cost ($1) vs profit ($2) tradeoff will be handled by OR backend's service-level calculation.

For demand, use default (all-samples) estimate: historical sample mean=111.4 -> mu_hat=(1+L)*mean=111.4. Volatility use population std of samples (\u224815.74) -> sigma_hat=\u221a(1+L)*std=15.74. These conservative estimates align with observed same-period arrivals and balance service (high profit $2 vs holding $1) by targeting roughly one period mean demand while keeping safety stock via sigma in OR backend.

LLM Rationale:
Recent concluded messages consistently show actual lead_time=0 through Period 20. On-hand=24, in-transit=0, so we must cover current-period demand immediately. I set L based on observed lead times (calculate) => 0. For demand I use the default aggregate estimate: mean of provided historical samples = 111.4 (so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean = 111.4). Volatility uses default population std -> std(samples)=~15.75, scaled by sqrt(1+L) => 15.75. These settings keep the OR engine's base-stock anchored to historical demand while recognizing zero lead time so orders arrive same period, balancing service level vs holding cost.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date Period_23. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead_time = 0 through Period_22, so same-period arrivals are reliable. On-hand=63, in-transit=0; with lead time 0 we can replenish within the same period so pipeline = 0. Historical demand samples (seeded data) mean = 111.4 units/period and std \u2248 17.61. I choose L by averaging observed lead times (gives L=0) and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the defaults: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) to reflect expected one-period demand, and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples) to capture observed volatility. This yields a base-stock targeting the profit/holding tradeoff while avoiding excess holding since arrivals are same-period and reliable.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead_time = 0 periods confirmed through Period_22 (evidence: concluded messages for Periods 1\u201322 show 'lead_time was 0 periods').

Daily Reward (R_t): $-73.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period: Period_24. Demand context: SKU is regular chips; recent concluded history (through Period_23) shows frequent same-period arrivals and variable demand with no obvious seasonality. On-hand=97, in-transit=0 (no outstanding arrivals visible). Concluded messages consistently confirm actual lead_time=0 through Period_22; no evidence of lost shipments. I choose L=default (promised lead time=0) because concluded history repeatedly verifies same-period arrivals. For demand forecasting I use the default estimators to remain consistent with historical samples: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) = 1*111.4 to target typical period demand; sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples) \u2248 17.605 to reflect observed variability. These parameters let the OR backend compute a service-level fronting (via z from profit/(profit+holding)) while avoiding excessive holding given holding cost=$1 and profit=$2.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period: Period_25. On-hand=51, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages through Period_24 consistently show arrived orders with lead_time=0 \u2014 no evidence of lost or delayed shipments. Demand history (seed samples) mean=111.4, std\u224817.61. I select L as the promised/default (0) because concluded history confirms same-period arrivals; mu_hat and sigma_hat use the default formulas ((1+L)*mean, sqrt(1+L)*std) so the OR engine receives a stable forecast (mu_hat=111.4) and volatility (sigma_hat=17.608) that reflect past demand and keep service-level/holding tradeoff aligned with profit/holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead_time=0 periods extended through Period_24 (evidence: conclude messages for Periods 1\u201324 show 'lead_time was 0 periods').

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26: lead-time history through Period 25 shows consistent actual lead_time=0 (orders concluded as same-period arrivals). On-hand=47, in-transit=0 \u2014 no pending arrivals. Historical demand samples (seed) = [112,97,116,138,94], mean=111.4, std\u224815.742. Given confirmed L=0, use default (promised) lead time and standard demand estimates to let the OR backend compute base-stock and cap consistently. This balances service (profit $2 vs holding $1 implies moderate service level) while avoiding extra inventory since on-hand is already 47 and no pipeline exists.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes through Period 26 consistently show actual lead_time=0 for all prior orders \u2014 no evidence of lost or delayed shipments. Demand seed samples = [112,97,116,138,94] (mean=111.4, std\u224817.61). With confirmed same-period arrivals, use promised lead time (L=0) and default demand/volatility formulas: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(samples) = 111.4 to target service vs holding tradeoff; sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(samples) = 17.61 to capture observed demand variability.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date: Period_29. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Concluded history consistently shows actual lead_time=0 for orders through Period_28 (each conclude: 'lead_time was 0 periods'), so actual lead time is stable at 0. Demand historical sample (provided) has mean 111.4 and std ~15.744. I choose default methods: L=promised (0) to match observed same-period arrivals; mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_all = 111.4 to set the base-stock around recent long-run mean; sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std_all = 15.744 to reflect observed demand variability. These parameters keep service level aligned with profit/(profit+holding)=2/(2+1)=0.667 while avoiding overstock given holding cost and zero lead time.

No evidence of demand regime change; base historical sample (provided) mean=111.4, std=15.744. I choose L by default (promised lead time=0) because concluded history confirms same-period arrivals. mu_hat set to default (1+L)*mean = 1*111.4 to cover expected current-period demand. sigma_hat set to default sqrt(1+L)*std = 1*15.744 to reflect observed volatility. These parameters instruct the OR backend to target the historical mean demand with appropriate safety stock given profit/holding tradeoff while avoiding excess holding cost given zero starting inventory and same-period replenishment.

Daily Reward (R_t): $220.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent concluded history consistently shows actual lead_time = 0 periods for orders through Period_31. On-hand and in-transit are both 0 now, so we must replenish to cover immediate (L+1) demand. Use default statistics from the provided past-sample set to set parameters: L=0 (promised and observed), mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(samples)=111.4 to target one-period demand, sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(samples)=15.744 to capture observed variability. This keeps the OR base-stock focused on ~one-period protection (limits holding cost) while maintaining service given high profit-to-hold ratio.

LLM Rationale:
Current period 34. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead_time = 0 for all observed orders through period 33, and on-hand = 106, in-transit = 0. No evidence of recent demand regime change; use the provided five-sample demand history as the basis. Choose promised/default lead time = 0 (consistent with concluded messages). Use default mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) = 111.4 to target average demand over the review+lead period. Use default sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples) = 15.739 to reflect observed demand variability. These conservative defaults align the OR engine's base-stock calculation with observed same-day deliveries while avoiding unnecessary extra safety stock given low holding cost relative to profit.

Demand historical samples (provided) have mean=111.4 and std\u224815.75; with L=0 use default formulas to set mu_hat and sigma_hat.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Concluded history shows consistent same-period arrivals (lead_time=0) through Period 36; on-hand=18, in-transit=0. I set L to the promised/default (0) because concluded messages provide strong evidence actual lead time = 0. I use the provided historical demand samples [112,97,116,138,94] (mean=111.4, sample std\u224817.61) and default formulas: mu_hat=(1+L)*mean -> 111.4, sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std -> 17.61. These parameters keep the OR engine focused on meeting typical weekly demand (~111 units) with modest safety stock given profit=$2 vs holding=$1 (service priority but avoiding excessive holding).

Carry-over insight: Actual lead_time=0 periods confirmed through Period_36 (evidence: concluded messages for Periods 1\u201336 show 'lead_time was 0 periods').

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 38: on-hand=77, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages consistently confirm actual lead_time=0 through Period_37, so use promised lead time. Demand baseline: provided seed samples [112,97,116,138,94] give mean=111.4 and sample std\u224817.607. I choose default methods: L=promised (0) to reflect confirmed same-period arrivals; mu_hat=(1+L)*mean_all = 111.4 to represent expected demand this review+lead window; sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std_all = 17.607 to capture observed variability. These settings keep the OR engine's base stock near historical demand (supports service with moderate safety stock) while avoiding excess holding given holding cost = $1 and profit = $2.

Daily Reward (R_t): $192.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_39: recent concluded history consistently shows actual lead_time = 0 (arrivals in Periods 1\u201338 conclude with 'lead_time was 0 periods'). Demand historical samples (provided) have mean 111.4 and std ~15.75. Profit=2, holding=1 => service quantile q=2/3, so standard newsvendor z modest; use default methods trusting stable zero lead time and historical demand to let OR engine compute base-stock. With on-hand=8 and no in-transit, keeping L=0 and mu_hat reflecting one-period demand avoids overstock given holding cost while matching typical demand scale.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40: history shows consistent same-period arrivals (concluded messages Periods 1\u201339 all report lead_time=0). On-hand=78, in-transit=0. Use promised/default lead time 0 (confirmed). Historical demand seed (given samples [112,97,116,138,94]) has mean=111.4 and std\u224815.75. Set mu_hat = (1+L)*mean = 111.4 to target typical demand per period; set sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std = 15.75 to capture observed variability. These choices keep the OR base-stock aligned with observed demand while avoiding unnecessary extra safety stock since lead time is zero and arrivals are reliable.

Daily Reward (R_t): $214.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 start. All concluded history through Period 40 shows actual lead_time = 0 (orders arrived same period). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, profit=$2, holding=$1. Historical sample mean demand = 111.4 units, sample std \u2248 17.61 (from provided past demands). With confirmed L=0, use default rules so the OR backend gets steady-state estimates: L=promised (0), mu_hat=(1+L)*mean=111.4 to cover current-period demand, sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std=17.61. This keeps service level aligned with profit/holding tradeoff while avoiding excess inventory given zero lead time and no pipeline.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42. Demand context: regular chips with past-sample mean 111.4 and std \u224815.75 (historical samples provided). On-hand=19, in-transit=0. Concluded history consistently shows actual lead_time=0 through Period 41, so same-period arrivals are reliable. I use promised/default lead time L=0. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using defaults: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean = 111.4 to target ~1-period demand; sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std = 15.75 to reflect observed variability. These parameters produce a moderate service level (profit $2 vs holding $1 \u2192 q\u22480.667) so the OR engine will hold modest safety stock while avoiding excessive holding cost given current on-hand inventory and reliable zero lead time.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period_43: current on-hand=32, in-transit=0. Historical sample mean=111.4 (samples: [112,97,116,138,94]) and realized lead-times have consistently been 0; no new evidence of regime change. Use promised/default lead time (L=0). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using defaults to reflect (1+L)-period demand based on full sample: mu_hat=(1+0)*mean=111.4, sigma_hat=sqrt(1+0)*std=15.74. These parameters give the OR engine a demand-centric base-stock to meet ~1 period of demand while not inflating safety stock absent signals, balancing $2 profit vs $1 holding cost.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 44. On-hand=48, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead_time=0 (orders in Periods 1\u201343 arrived same period). Demand seed samples = [112,97,116,138,94] => mean=111.4, std\u224817.6. With confirmed same-period arrivals I use promised lead time (L=0). I choose default mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_all = 111.4 to reflect long-run average demand; sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std_all = 17.6 to capture observed variability. These settings keep the OR base-stock anchored to historical demand while leveraging zero lead time (fast replenishment) to avoid excess pipeline and reduce holding costs given holding=$1/unit and profit=$2/unit.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_45: no special calendar events. On-hand=0 and in-transit=0, so we must replenish immediately. Concluded history consistently shows actual lead_time=0 (orders arrive same period) through Period_44, so use promised lead time. Demand history (seed samples) has mean\u2248111.4 and std\u224817.6; no strong evidence of a recent demand regime shift. Therefore use default calculations with L=0 so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean \u2248111.4 and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std \u224817.6. These parameters supply the OR engine with a base-stock centered on observed mean demand (high service given profit>holding) while not inflating safety stock absent a volatility or lead-time change.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent concluded history shows consistent lead_time=0 for all observed orders; demand context: historical samples mean=111.4, std\u224815.74. Current on-hand=36, in-transit=0 \u2014 well below one-period demand (\u2248111). I set L to promised/observed 0. mu_hat uses default (1+L)*mean to target one-period expected demand (111.4). sigma_hat uses default population scaling sqrt(1+L)*std (\u224815.74) so the OR backend will compute a base-stock that balances the $2 profit vs $1 holding cost (q=2/(2+1)=0.666..), yielding a moderate service level without excessive holdings; given low pipeline and same-period arrivals historically, this replenishment stance keeps service high while limiting holding cost exposure.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
No calendar/news signals; historical demand samples mean=111.4, std\u224815.74. Concluded-history consistently shows actual lead_time=0 through Period_46 and current on-hand=89, in-transit=0. Use promised lead time (0) and default demand aggregation so OR backend uses full-sample statistics. This yields mu_hat=(1+L)*mean=111.4 to target typical period demand and sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std\u224815.74 to capture observed variability; this balances service (q\u22480.667 \u2192 z\u22480.43) vs holding cost given current healthy on-hand stock.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

=== Period 48 Summary ===

Daily Profit: $210.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $210.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_49 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead_time=0 through Period_48, so use promised/default lead time L=0. Use default demand estimates seeded by provided historical samples (mean=111.4, std\u224817.61) scaled by (1+L)=1: mu_hat=111.4, sigma_hat=17.61. These parameters keep the base-stock tied to observed mean demand (covering current-period demand since arrivals are same-period) while reflecting observed variability to balance service level (profit $2 vs holding $1) against holding cost.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_50 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded messages through Period_49 consistently show actual lead_time=0 (orders arrived same period). Demand history shows mean ~111.4 and moderate volatility (std ~15.74) with frequent stockouts following high spikes (recent demands as high as 192 and 182 in Periods 48\u201349). I choose L=promised (0) because concluded messages confirm same-period arrivals. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to the defaults so the OR engine uses the long-run sample mean/volatility (mu_hat = (1+L)*mean, sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std). This balances service (capture the ~111 mean demand) against holding cost given frequent high-demand spikes; with lead time = 0 the policy can react each period to demand shocks.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead_time = 0 periods extended through Period_49 (evidence: concluded messages for Periods 1\u201349 show 'lead_time was 0 periods').
