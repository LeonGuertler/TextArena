Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. No on-hand or in-transit inventory; no concluded arrivals to infer lead time. Historical demand samples: [112,97,116,138,94] (mean \u2248111.4). Promised lead time=2; no evidence to change. Use default estimates so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std, balancing service vs holding given moderate demand and equal profit/holding tradeoff.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_2 decision. On-hand=0, in-transit=141 (order placed Period_1) but Period_1 conclude shows arrived=0 so no concluded arrivals exist to infer actual lead time. Promised lead time = 2 retained (use default). Demand history [112,97,116,138,94] shows no clear changepoint; use default aggregation for demand and volatility: mu_hat and sigma_hat set to default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std with L=promised. This keeps policy aligned with known statistics while flagging the missing arrival for monitoring.

Carry-over insight: Order of 141 units placed in Period_1 has not concluded (Period_1 conclude arrived=0) \u2014 possible lost or delayed shipment; monitor for non-arrival in subsequent concludes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $207.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3 decision: observed demand history [112,97,116,138,94] with mean 111.4. Recent concludes show the Period_1 order (141) first reported as arrived=0 but Period_2 conclude shows it arrived in Period_2 (ordered Period_1, lead_time=1). Evidence indicates actual lead time = 1 period. I choose L by 'calculate' (average of observed lead times) to capture the observed lead-time regime. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given modest sample size and confirmed shorter lead time. This addresses the earlier apparent lost shipment (now resolved) and ensures pipeline coverage for (L+1) periods.

Carry-over insight: Observed actual lead time = 1 period (Period_2 conclude: arrived=141 units ordered on Period_1, lead_time was 1). Previous 'arrived=0' for Period_1 order resolved; do not treat as lost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $50.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date Period_4. On-hand=0, in-transit=207 (orders from Period_2=137 and Period_3=70). Promised L=2 but observed lead time recently =1 (Period_2 conclude: arrived=141 ordered P1, lead_time=1). One in-transit order (137) is overdue relative to observed 1-period lead time \u2014 treat actual lead time as 1 to avoid over-ordering. I set L using recent_N (N=1) to anchor to the single observed lead-time sample. mu_hat and sigma_hat use default formulas so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all 5 demand samples [112,97,116,138,94], balancing service level (profit=2 vs holding=1) while avoiding extra safety stock given large pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5: on-hand=0, in-transit=225. Recent demands = [112,97,116,138,94] (mean ~111). Observed concluded lead times: one observed = 1 (Period_2 conclude for Period_1 order). No sustained evidence of lost shipments beyond the single 1-period realization; recent Period_3/4 orders have not yet concluded but are still within plausible delivery window. Set L using 'calculate' to use the average of observed lead times (captures the observed 1-period actual). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, preserving full-sample demand signal while adjusting for inferred lead time. This balances service (accounting for shorter observed lead time) against holding cost given limited on-hand inventory and sizable pipeline.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_6: on-hand=0, in-transit=225. Recent concluded history shows an actual lead time = 1 period (Period_2 conclude: arrived 141 ordered Period_1, lead_time=1). Demand recently softened vs earlier samples (most recent demands Period_3-5 = 64, 92, 88). I set L to recent_N to reflect the observed 1-period lead-time regime. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 (last three demand observations) so the (1+L) demand forecast and volatility reflect the lower recent demand rather than older higher values. This keeps replenishment modest (reducing holding cost) while covering the short observed lead time and recent demand level. I note in-transit=225 must be counted in pipeline when placing orders to avoid overstock.

Carry-over insight: Observed sustained lead-time regime shift: actual lead time = 1 period (evidence: Period_2 conclude: arrived=141 units ordered Period_1, lead_time=1).

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_7. Historical demands = [112,97,116,138,94] (mean=111.4). Concluded arrivals indicate an actual lead time of 1 period (Period_2 conclude: arrived 141 ordered Period_1, lead_time=1) and recent conclues show no contradictory evidence \u2014 use calculated average lead time. On-hand=0, in-transit=225 units (sufficient coverage for (1+L) periods given L=1). Choose L="calculate" to let backend use observed lead times (captures the sustained shift to 1). Use mu_hat="default" and sigma_hat="default" so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, providing a balanced base-stock against profit/holding tradeoff given Profit=$2, Holding=$1.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8. Recent demand samples = [112,97,116,138,94] (mean=111.4). On-hand=0, in-transit=207. Concluded arrivals show variable lead times: Period_2 conclude => order on P1 arrived with lead_time=1; Period_7 conclude => order on P4 arrived with lead_time=3. This indicates intermittent delays; use the average observed lead time so the OR backend accounts for variability. Set L by 'calculate' (backend averages observed lead times). For demand forecast use 'default' so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) (conservative smoothing across available history). Use 'default' sigma_hat (sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples)). These choices balance service (accounting for observed longer deliveries) vs holding cost given zero on-hand but sizable in-transit.

Carry-over insight: Lead time is variable: observed lead_times = 1 (P1\u2192P2) and 3 (P4\u2192P7); treat current effective lead time as average (~2) until further evidence.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9: on-hand=0, in-transit=242. Recent concluded lead times: 1 (P1\u2192P2) and 3 (P4\u2192P7) => effective lead time \u22482. Use explicit L=2 to reflect observed variability rather than promised L=2 default ambiguity. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, letting the model scale forecasts/uncertainty to the chosen L. This addresses past delayed arrival (P4\u2192P7) by provisioning for a 2-period lead and leverages all demand history to balance service vs holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Lead time variability observed: concluded lead_times = 1 (P1\u2192P2) and 3 (P4\u2192P7); treat current effective lead time as 2 until further evidence.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 decision. On-hand=0, in-transit=325. Observed concluded lead_times: 1 period (P1\u2192P2) and 3 periods (P4\u2192P7) \u2014 recent average = 2. Use L recent_N to capture this variable regime. Demand history mean=111.4 (samples [112,97,116,138,94]); using mu_hat default yields (1+L)*mean to cover review+lead demand. Use sigma_hat default to scale std by sqrt(1+L). These choices balance service (covering 3 periods of demand given avg lead time\u22482) vs holding cost while relying on backend cap to limit order size given large in-transit volume.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11: on-hand=0, in-transit=325, recent concluded lead_times = [1 (P1\u2192P2), 3 (P4\u2192P7)] => effective lead time \u22482. Demand history samples = [112,97,116,138,94] with mean=111.4. I set L to recent_N (N=2) to reflect the two observed lead-time realizations and capture variability. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given lead-time uncertainty and the large in-transit pipeline. This approach is conservative: it increases forecast horizon for orders without overfitting short-term noise.

Carry-over insight: Lead time variable; observed concluded lead_times 1 (P1\u2192P2) and 3 (P4\u2192P7) \u2192 treat effective lead time as ~2 until new concluded evidence.

Recent history shows intermittent lost/delayed arrivals; using an explicit L=2 reflects the current effective lead time to buffer against further variability.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_15: on-hand=0, in-transit=350. Historical concluded lead_times = [1 (P1\u2192P2), 3 (P4\u2192P7), 3 (P9\u2192P12)] \u2192 average lead_time \u2248 2.33. Demand history samples = [112,97,116,138,94]. No currently-unresolved lost orders (recent concludes accounted for arrivals). Set L by calculating average of observed lead times to capture variable regime (~2.33). Use default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given the longer effective lead time and high in-transit inventory.

Carry-over insight: Observed lead-time regime shifted to variable with mean \u22482.33 based on concluded lead_times 1 (P1\u2192P2), 3 (P4\u2192P7), 3 (P9\u2192P12); treat effective lead time ~2.33 until new concluded evidence.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_16 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=350. Concluded arrivals show lead_times = 1 (P1\u2192P2), 3 (P4\u2192P7), 3 (P9\u2192P12) \u2192 average \u22482.33, so use calculated average lead time to capture variable regime. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, providing a stable forecast scaled for the chosen L; this conservatively balances service (covering L+1 periods) against holding cost given large pipeline.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17: on-hand=0, in-transit=350. Historical concluded lead_times show variability with mean \u22482.33 (observed 1,3,3); recent pattern implies effective lead time > promised 2. To cover demand over review+lead and account for delayed arrivals, I set L explicitly to 2.33. Using an explicit mu_hat of 371 (\u2248(1+2.33)\xd7mean historical demand 111.4) keeps the base-stock sized to cover ~3.33 periods of demand. I set sigma_hat explicitly to 29 to reflect elevated demand variability (\u224828.8 computed from sample std scaled by sqrt(1+L)) so the OR engine increases safety stock despite transit uncertainty. These settings prioritize avoiding stockouts given large in-transit but delayed arrivals while balancing holding cost.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Several recent arrivals show a multi-period lead-time regime (mostly 3), so set L explicitly to 2.5 to hedge against longer arrivals. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the provided demand samples; this balances service level (through longer effective lead time) against holding cost given limited on-hand but large in-transit.

Demand samples (seed) mean=111.4. Given multiple recent 3-period conclusions and one early 1-period, use 'calculate' for L to let backend average observed lead times. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend scales demand mean/variance by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L) respectively; this balances higher safety stock for longer effective lead time while relying on historical demand samples. This addresses prior delayed shipments by explicitly reflecting observed longer/variable lead time in L while leaving demand estimates grounded in full sample history.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime shifted to longer/variable with mean \u22482.6 based on concluded lead_times 1 (P1\u2192P2), 3 (P4\u2192P7), 3 (P9\u2192P12), 3 (P14\u2192P17), 3 (P17\u2192P20); treat effective lead time \u22482.6 until new concluded evidence.

Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this leverages full history while the calculated L inflates the review+lead horizon to cover longer lead times and the larger pipeline, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=$2, holding=$1.

Given persistent multi-period 3-length arrivals and earlier 1-period spike, effective lead time is longer/variable; choose explicit L=2.6 to capture this regime. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples (stable demand history: mean=111.4 from [112,97,116,138,94]). This increases target base-stock to cover the longer effective pipeline while sigma scaling preserves variability for service-level tradeoff; helps mitigate stockouts given observed multi-period delays while balancing holding cost.

Lead time regime is variable but recent average \u22482.33 \u2014 use recent_N for L to reflect observed concluded lead times. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7sample mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std, letting OR engine size orders given promised lead-time model while accounting for observed longer/variable lead times.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_26: on-hand=0, in-transit=322. Concluded lead_times observed = {1,3,3,3,3,1,3} (from Period concludes) => use averaged lead time to capture variable/lengthened regime. Set L via 'calculate' to let backend compute average observed lead time. Demand history (seed) mean=111.4 from provided samples; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std respectively, which balances service level vs holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1 and substantial pipeline. This handles missing/delayed arrivals by raising the effective review+lead demand coverage via averaged L.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27: on-hand=0, in-transit=322. Historical concluded lead_times show variability (1 and multiple 3s) with recent estimate \u22482.33. I set L explicit=2.33 to reflect the longer/variable effective lead time and to ensure pipeline coverage; mu_hat explicit set to (1+L)\xd7mean(historical samples) \u2248371 to size base-stock for the review+lead period given higher effective L; sigma_hat default lets backend compute volatility scaling from all samples. This combination hedges against delayed arrivals while letting OR cap limit excessive orders given holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime shifted to longer/variable with effective lead time \u22482.33 based on concluded lead_times: 1 (P1\u2192P2), 3 (P4\u2192P7), 3 (P9\u2192P12), 3 (P14\u2192P17), 3 (P17\u2192P20), 1 (P23\u2192P24); treat L\u22482.33 until new concluded evidence.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28: on-hand=0, in-transit=400. Historical concluded lead_times = [1,3,3,3,3,1,3] (orders P1\u2192P2, P4\u2192P7, P9\u2192P12, P14\u2192P17, P17\u2192P20, P23\u2192P24, P22\u2192P25) indicating a longer/variable lead-time regime. Use calculate for L to let backend average observed lead times; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) respectively, leveraging full demand history (samples mean=111.4) and the inferred L to size orders while balancing service vs holding cost given profit=2 and holding=1.

Carry-over insight: Updated effective lead time \u22482.43 based on concluded lead_times [1,3,3,3,3,1,3] (mean=17/7\u22482.4286); treat L as longer/variable until new concluded evidence.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29. Recent concluded lead-times [1,3,3,3,3,1,3] give mean \u22482.43; demand history samples mean=111.4. On-hand=0, in-transit=322 (covers several periods given L\u22482.43). Use explicit L=2.43 to reflect observed longer/variable lead time so the OR engine sizes orders for the longer pipeline; keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given the higher effective lead time and substantial in-transit stock.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30: on-hand=0, in-transit=347. Recent concluded lead-times are variable (mean \u22482.43), so I set L explicit to 2.43 to reflect current effective lead time. Using default mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples so base-stock accounts for full review+lead demand and observed variance. This balances higher safety-stock needs from longer/variable lead time against holding cost; large in-transit (347) will reduce orders via pipeline offset.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31: on-hand=0, in-transit=352; recent demand history is high and variable (samples: [112,97,116,138,94]). Concluded lead times have alternated between 1 and 3 periods; use calculate to let backend average observed lead times (captures variable regime). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, ensuring orders cover review+lead demand while the adaptive L captures the longer/variable lead-time observed. This balances service (avoid stockouts given high demand) against holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32: on-hand=0, in-transit=352. Concluded lead_times list recent = [1,3,3,3,3,1,3,1] (mean=2.25). Demand samples = [112,97,116,138,94] (use recent_N on all 5). Choose L via recent_N N=8 to capture current mixed 1/3-day regime. Set mu_hat recent_N N=5 to base forecast on the full demand sample multiplied by (1+L). Use sigma_hat default to let backend scale volatility across (1+L). This balances service (higher L \u2192 larger mu_hat) while avoiding excessive holding by relying on observed variability for sigma.

Carry-over insight: Updated effective lead time estimate \u22482.25 based on concluded lead_times [1,3,3,3,3,1,3,1] (mean=18/8=2.25); treat L\u22482.25 until new concluded evidence.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33: on-hand=0, in-transit=424. Concluded lead-times through Period_32 show variability with recent mean \u22482.25 (evidence: concluded lead_times = [1,3,3,3,3,1,3,1], mean=18/8=2.25). Several prior orders experienced 1- and 3-period leads but no persistent lost-shipment signal; large in-transit balance suggests arrivals will cover demand when they conclude. I set L explicitly to 2.25 to reflect the observed effective lead time average and to ensure the backend plans for longer, variable replenishment. For demand and volatility I use the defaults so the OR engine applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the historical demand samples (keeps forecasting stable given noisy, intermittent sales). This balances higher service-level needs due to longer effective lead time against holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_34: on-hand=0, in-transit=424. Historical concluded lead_times = [1,3,3,3,3,1,3,1,3] (from concluded messages); average lead time \u22482.33. Recent history shows variable but persistently longer lead times vs promised 2 \u2014 use calculated average to capture that. Use mu_hat default and sigma_hat default so backend scales demand over (1+L) using all historical demand samples (no abrupt demand-level changepoint detected in the 5-sample history). This balances higher pipeline coverage for variable/longer lead times while letting OR engine compute safety stock via its q-based z*.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime shifted to longer/variable with mean \u22482.33 based on concluded lead_times [1,3,3,3,3,1,3,1,3] (Periods where arrivals concluded); treat effective L\u22482.33 until new concluded evidence.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35. Recent demand is volatile with many stockouts; on-hand=0, in-transit=424. Concluded arrivals show variable lead times (mix of 1 and 3 periods). I set L explicitly to 2.33 (current effective lead time estimate) to reflect the longer/variable pipeline so orders cover the appropriate review+lead period. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples (stable sample set = [112,97,116,138,94]) to balance service level vs holding cost given high in-transit volume.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime is variable and currently longer than promised: effective L \u2248 2.33 based on concluded lead_times through Period_34 (sequence includes 1 and multiple 3-period observations).

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period_36: on-hand=0, in-transit=424. Historical concluded lead_times show a variable, longer regime (recent mean \u22482.33 based on multiple 1- and 3-period observations). One earlier late/no-arrival resolved; no new lost-shipment evidence. I set L explicitly to 2.33 to reflect the observed multi-period lead-time regime so the OR engine will cover (1+L) periods of demand. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of the demand samples (conservative pooling of available demand history) to balance service level versus holding cost given sizable in-transit inventory.

Historical concluded lead_times are variable (mix of 1 and 3 period observations) and recent regime estimates center ~2.33; to guard against longer/variable arrivals I set L explicitly to 2.33. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples (keeps forecast anchored to full-sample stats while the explicit L accounts for longer effective lead time). This balances higher required pipeline for service against holding cost given large existing in-transit.

Several past orders experienced 3-period delays; no new concluded arrivals in Period 37 to contradict the longer regime. I set L explicit=2.33 to reflect the observed effective lead time and guard against stockouts from delayed arrivals. For demand parameters I use default methods so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the demand samples, letting the OR engine produce a base-stock that balances profit ($2) vs holding cost ($1) under the longer inferred lead time and the existing in-transit pipeline.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_39: on-hand=0, in-transit=424. Concluded lead-time history shows a variable regime with recent effective mean \u22482.33 (multiple concluded lead_times: 1 and several 3s through Period_35). To protect against delayed arrivals and variable lead time, set L explicitly to 2.33. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, balancing service level (accounting for longer L) against holding cost.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40. Historical small-sample demand mean (given data) used as baseline; recent concluded lead-time regime is variable and longer than promised, effective \u22482.33. On-hand=0, in-transit=424 \u2014 large pipeline already covers multiple periods of demand so avoid aggressive uplifts to mu/sigma. Choose L explicit=2.33 to reflect empirical concluded lead-time regime (reduces risk of under-ordering vs promised L=2). Use mu_hat default and sigma_hat default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample, letting OR engine incorporate the longer L while respecting historical demand statistics and the capped order cap.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41: on-hand=0, in-transit=424. Historical concluded lead-times are variable; recent consolidated estimate is \u22482.33 periods (multiple concluded arrivals show mix of 1 and 3-period leads). To account for the longer/variable effective lead time and ensure pipeline covers current demand across review+lead, set L explicitly to 2.33. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend applies (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from the demand samples; this balances higher safety stock from longer L against holding cost while leveraging historical demand statistics.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime remains variable and currently longer than promised; effective L \u22482.33 based on concluded lead_times through Period_35 (mix of 1- and 3-period observations).

LLM Rationale:
Period_42: on-hand=0, in-transit=424. Historical concluded lead_times are mixed with recent average \u22482.33 (multiple 3s and some 1s). Promised L=2 underestimates effective arrival lag; using explicit L=2.33 better aligns pipeline coverage with observed variability. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, letting the model scale safety stock to the adjusted lead time and preserve service vs holding tradeoff.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43: demand history shows high variability (samples [112,97,116,138,94]) and many concluded lead-times (recent sequence [1,3,3,3,3,1,3,1,3]) giving an effective lead time > promised. On-hand=0, in-transit=424 \u2014 sufficient to cover multiple periods (pipeline >> (1+estimated L)*mean demand). I set L using recent_N over the last 9 observed lead-times to capture the current variable/longer regime. mu_hat and sigma_hat use default methods so the OR engine computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all demand samples, letting the backend combine the chosen L with full-sample demand stats. This balances service (higher L raises required pipeline) with holding cost given a large existing in-transit position.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44: on-hand=0, in-transit=424. Historical concluded lead-times show a variable, longer-than-promised regime (mix of 1- and 3-period observations) with recent effective mean \u22482.33. In-transit inventory exists but arrivals will only be visible in future concludes; treat no shipments as lost now. Set L explicitly to 2.33 to reflect observed effective lead time. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the seeded historical demand samples, letting the backend balance service level and holding cost given the longer effective lead time.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_45: on-hand=0, in-transit=424. Historical concluded lead_times are variable with multiple 3-period observations and some 1-periods; effective lead time has stabilized longer than promised. I set L explicitly to 2.33 to reflect the concluded lead-time mean (\u22482.33) so the OR engine sizes orders for a longer pipeline. Demand recently has been elevated/variable; I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the latest demand regime (last 5 period demands) so base_stock responds to current demand rather than older low-demand samples. These choices increase service-level during longer lead times while avoiding excessive inventory from stale low-demand history.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime shifted to longer/variable: effective L \u2248 2.33 based on concluded lead_times through Period_34\u2013Period_35 evidence (mix of 1- and multiple 3-period observations).

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:

To protect service given high in-transit but variable arrivals, I set L explicitly to 2.33 to reflect observed effective lead time. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, preserving full-sample stability while the explicit L corrects for longer/more-variable supply.

To protect service given large pipeline but variable delays, set L explicit=2.33 so OR backend plans across longer effective lead time. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so demand forecast uses all historical samples scaled by (1+L) \u2014 conservative given limited sample set and high demand variability. This addresses past delayed 1\u21923-period arrivals and avoids under-ordering if actual lead time remains >2.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 50: recent demand has surged (last 5 period demands: 72, 18, 24, 192, 182) while on-hand=0 and in-transit=424. Concluded arrivals historically show variable lead times (mix of 1- and 3-periods); recent regime evidence supports effective L\u22482.33. To protect service vs holding cost, set lead time explicitly to 2.33 and base demand forecast on the most recent 5 periods to capture the current high-demand regime; estimate volatility from the same recent window. This ensures the OR backend increases target inventory for the current demand spike while keeping variability estimate aligned with recent observations.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime: variable and currently longer than promised; effective L \u2248 2.33 based on concluded lead_times (mix of 1- and multiple 3-period observations through Period_34\u2013Period_35).
