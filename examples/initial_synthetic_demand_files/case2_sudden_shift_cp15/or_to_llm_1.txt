Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Inventory & lead-time: on-hand=0, in-transit=625. Historical concluded arrivals show variable actual lead times (1\u20133 periods) with some lost shipments earlier, but recent pipeline arrivals have largely materialized, so treat in-transit as available albeit arriving over 1\u20133 periods. Demand outlook: confirmed regime shift at Period 16 increased mean demand to ~195 and recent demands are even higher (Periods 47\u201349: 231, 208, 224; 3-period avg \u2248 221). Need to cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand because orders placed now only affect demand beyond that window. Expected demand over next 3 periods \u2248 3 \xd7 221 = 663 units. Pipeline 625 leaves a shortfall \u2248 38 units. Tradeoff: ordering more raises holding cost ($1/unit/period) while stockouts forego $4 profit/unit. Given profit>holding (critical fractile favors stocking), I will top up to cover the shortfall plus a small buffer of ~2 units to reduce immediate stockout risk from arrival timing variability. Final order = 40 units.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Pipeline (625) nearly covers 3-period demand (~663) but leaves ~38-unit shortfall; order 40 units to cover shortfall + small buffer given high recent demand and variable arrival timing.",
