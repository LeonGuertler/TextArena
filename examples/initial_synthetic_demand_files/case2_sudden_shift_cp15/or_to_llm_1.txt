Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "1) Lead-time & pipeline: Concluded history confirms actual lead time = 4 periods (already recorded). Current visible inventory = on-hand 21 + in-transit 583 = 604 units that will cover future demand only as those in-transit arrive over the next periods. 2) Demand outlook: Recent periods (P45\u2013P49) show sustained high demand: [204,208,231,208,224] \u2192 recent single-period avg \u2248 215. This aligns with previously recorded regime shift (Periods 14\u201318) and indicates elevated demand persists. 3) Coverage target: With L=4, we must plan for (L+1)=5 periods of demand after placing an order. Five-period demand = 5 \xd7 215 = 1,075 units. 4) Shortfall calc: Required pipeline+on-hand to cover 5 periods = 1,075; current pipeline+on-hand = 604; shortfall = 1,075 \u2212 604 = 471 units. 5) OR recommendation: OR suggests 258 (uses promised L and older history). Given confirmed lead time and much higher recent demand, OR\u2019s 258 is insufficient. 6) Decision: Order 471 units to bring total committed inventory close to the 5-period demand target (minimizes expected stockouts given current regime). 7) Risk/holding: This increases on-hand risk but profit per unit ($4) >> holding cost per period ($1), and avoiding stockouts at current high demand yields higher expected reward. 8) Carry-over: No new multi-period patterns to add (existing lead-time and demand-shift insights already recorded).",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Increased OR's 258\u2192471 units because confirmed lead time=4 and recent demand is ~215/day; need ~1,075 units to cover 5 periods and current pipeline+on-hand=604, so order 471 to avoid stockouts.",
