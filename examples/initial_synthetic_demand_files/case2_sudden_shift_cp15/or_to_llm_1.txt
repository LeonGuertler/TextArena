{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: confirmed lead time = 0 (carry-over insight). Therefore orders arrive within the same period they are placed and will be available to meet Period 49 demand. Inventory / demand: on-hand = 4, in-transit = 0. Recent realized demand has been high and stable in the 180\u2013230 range (many recent periods ~200+; OR cap and base-stock reflect this). OR recommends 209 units using historical demand and promised L; that would replenish to a base-stock near ~213 and covers expected single-period demand. Adjustment: subtract on-hand (4) from OR's 209 to avoid double-counting current on-hand inventory. Ordering 205 units brings available stock this period to 209 (4 existing + 205 ordered) to match OR's target and maintain service given high recent demand while minimizing extra holding cost. No new sustained pattern detected to record.",

{
  "rationale": "Lead time confirmed 0 (carry-over). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so entire period demand must be covered by this order. Recent realized demands (Periods 46\u201349): 208, 231, 208, 224 \u2192 recent average \u2248217, showing sustained higher-demand regime vs early history.
