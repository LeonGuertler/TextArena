  "rationale": "a) World/product: chips(Regular) is a regular snack SKU with historical samples for prior demand. No calendar/date-driven events provided.\nb) Demand regime: historical mean = (112+97+116+138+94)/5 = 111.4 \u2248 111 units/period; variance moderate. No evidence of a regime shift.\nc) Lead-time vs missing orders: Supplier promised LT=0 but actual LT unknown; no concluded arrivals to infer real LT. Assume potential LT\u22650; to be conservative avoid heavy multi-period prebuild because holding cost ($1/unit/period) is high relative to profit ($2/unit).\n d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, in-transit=0, so current period demand cannot be met. Orders placed now will arrive according to actual LT (unknown) \u2014 if LT=0 they arrive same period; if LT=1 they arrive next period.\n e) Final order logic: Use historical mean as the best unbiased forecast. To balance service and holding cost, order approximately one period\u2019s expected demand (111). Round to 112 units to match historical sample and avoid fractional orders. This limits overstock risk given high holding cost while providing near-full service if actual LT is 0 or 1.",
