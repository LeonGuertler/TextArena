Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:

{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: historical concluded arrivals show supplier lead time stochastic between 1\u20133 periods. Demand: recent short-run mean \u2248195 units/period (Periods 16\u201319 and sustained thereafter). Inventory check: on-hand=0, in-transit=780 units. Decision rule: ensure on-hand + in-transit + order covers (max_lead_time + 1) periods of demand; using max_lead_time=3 \u2192 cover 4 periods. Required coverage = 4 \xd7 195 = 780 units. Current pipeline (780) already meets this target, so no additional order is needed now. Follow-up: monitor upcoming conclude messages to verify actual arrival timing and adjust if pipeline falls below 4-period coverage or demand shifts.",
