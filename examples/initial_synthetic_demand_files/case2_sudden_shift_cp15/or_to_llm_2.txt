Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:

{
  "rationale": "Lead-time & pipeline: Promised L=2, on-hand=0, in-transit=633. Earlier carry-over flagged a lost shipment of ~139 units (Period 9 insight), so adjust effective pipeline to 633\u2212139=494. Demand outlook: recent periods show the sustained high-demand regime (carry-over: avg \u2248227.6 since Period 27); recent demands ~204\u2013231 support using ~228 as single-period demand. Coverage target: order to cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand \u22483\xd7228=684 units. Required order = target coverage \u2212 (on-hand + effective pipeline) = 684 \u2212 494 = 190. Rounding to integer and keeping nonnegative. I deviate from OR (0) because pipeline is likely short of the elevated demand once lost shipment is removed and we must cover 3 periods including current period's demand that occurs after decision.",
