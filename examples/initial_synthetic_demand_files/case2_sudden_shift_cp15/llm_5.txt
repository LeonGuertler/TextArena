  "rationale": "a) World/product: chips(Regular) is non-seasonal snack; recent history drives forecast. b) Demand regime: Recent 7-period demand (P43\u2013P49) = [176,208,204,208,231,208,224], avg \u2248206 units/period \u2014 consistent with prior high-demand regime (~203). c) Lead time: Confirmed LT=4 (already recorded). d) Inventory/pipeline: On-hand=0, In-transit=873 units. With LT=4 we must cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand after ordering. Forecast 5-period demand \u22485\xd7206=1,030 units. Pipeline shortfall = 1,030\u2212873 = 157 units. e) Order logic: Order to bring expected available supply \u2248 cover 5 periods of demand while avoiding large overstocks. Place an order of 160 units (rounding up slightly for safety).",
