{
  "rationale": "Context & lead-time: On-hand=0, in-transit=598. Historical concluded arrivals show variable lead times (1\u20133) and some long ETAs, but no new sustained lead-time change to record. Demand outlook: recent sustained regime shift raised single-period demand to ~201 units (Periods 22\u201327 avg) and later periods show demand ~200+; use 201 as current mean. Coverage check: promised L=2 \u2192 need to cover L+1=3 periods \u2192 target pipeline \u2248 3\xd7201 = 603 units. Current pipeline (598) is ~5 units short of the 3-period target; given observation noise, variable lead times, and risk of lost/delayed shipments, I will top up modestly rather than follow OR's 0 recommendation. Trade-offs: profit=$4, holding=$1 (critical fractile 0.8 \u2192 some safety stock justified), but excessive ordering incurs holding cost; therefore place a small order to cover the slight shortfall and provide a tiny buffer. Final action: order 10 units (brings pipeline to 608 \u2248 target+buffer).",

OR recommended 104 (uses older mean and promised L); I increase toward the shortfall to ensure coverage given high recent demand and variable actual lead times (observed 1\u20133 periods). I avoid over-ordering beyond the 3-period target to limit holding cost given already-large pipeline and some lead-time uncertainty.
