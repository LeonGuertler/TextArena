Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Observations: on-hand=0, in-transit=0, supplier lead time previously confirmed as 0 (Period 4 insight). Recent demand has been in the 200+ range (Periods 47\u201349 demands: 231, 208, 224 \u2192 recent avg \u2248 221), consistent with the documented demand regime shift beginning Period 16 (+64% vs original historical). OR recommends 214 units based on promised lead time and historical data; that is slightly below the recent realized mean. With lead time = 0, an order placed now arrives in-time for Period 50 demand, so we should match expected current-period demand while avoiding excessive end-of-period inventory (holding cost = $1/unit). Profit per unit is $4, so understock is costly relative to holding but the recent three-period average (\u2248221) is the best indicator of immediate demand. Decision: increase OR's 214 \u2192 221 units to cover recent average demand and minimize stockouts while keeping holding modest.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Raised OR's 214\u2192221 units because lead time is confirmed 0 and recent 3-period average demand \u2248221 (sustained high-demand regime), so order to meet expected sales this period.",
