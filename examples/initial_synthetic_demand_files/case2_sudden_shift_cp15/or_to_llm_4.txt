Rationale: OR\u2019s cap limits per-period order to avoid overshooting given demand variability; ordering 137 now plus the 141 in-transit gives ~278 units covering most of the 3-period expected demand while avoiding excessive holding costs. Increasing above OR would modestly reduce stockout risk but materially raise holding cost given profit/holding ratio (2:1) and uncertain actual lead time and possible lost shipments.

Strategy: Because lead time is variable and recent demand is much higher, I will override OR and place a significantly larger order than OR's 80 to rebuild pipeline and cover near-term elevated demand. Calculation intuition: to cover ~3 periods at recent demand (3\xd7183\u2248549) we need ~549\u2212287\u2248262 additional units; to balance holding cost risk if spike is transient, I compromise and order 200 units now (partial replenishment toward covering elevated demand while limiting holding cost).
