{
  "rationale": "History shows a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 16 (avg ~196 over P16\u201320 and continued ~200+ thereafter). Current on-hand=0, in-transit=633. With promised lead time 2 (L=2) we must cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand: target pipeline \u2248 3 \xd7 recent demand (~220) \u2248 660 units. Pipeline shortfall \u2248 660\u2212633 = 27 units. OR recommended 0 (it uses promised L and older stats), but given persistent high demand and variable/occasionally lost arrivals, I top up modestly to avoid stockouts. Order 50 units: covers the shortfall with a small safety margin while limiting holding cost exposure (profit $4 vs holding $1 supports some safety stock). No concluded arrival in this period to change lead-time belief; monitor arrivals next periods.",
