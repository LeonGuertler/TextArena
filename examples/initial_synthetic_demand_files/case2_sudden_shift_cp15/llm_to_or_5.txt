Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
No concluded arrivals yet and starting on-hand=0. Historical demand mean = 111.4 (samples [112,97,116,138,94]). No evidence of lead-time deviation or demand regime change. Use promised lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes base-stock from the historical mean/variance and the known promised L=4.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_2: on-hand=0, in-transit=141 (order placed Period_1). No arrivals have concluded beyond Period_1, so actual lead time cannot be inferred yet (cannot treat the Period_1 arrived=0 as evidence). Demand history mean=111.4 across five samples. Promised lead time remains the best prior; using default L and default demand moments lets the OR engine compute base-stock using all available historical demand and the promised lead time. Current pipeline (141) is well below the (1+L)-period demand implied by history, so OR will likely order more \u2014 default settings balance service vs holding cost given no confirmed lead-time change or demand regime shift.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period: Period_3. Promised lead time=4. Historical concluded messages show no arrivals for orders placed in Periods 1\u20132; in-transit = 278 (141+137). Demand history: [112,97,116,138,94], mean=111.4. I will keep L as default (promised 4) because arrivals are delayed but not yet conclusively lost and the OR engine expects promised L. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from full sample set, providing a conservative replenishment covering review+lead demand while letting the OR engine apply service-level calibration.

Carry-over insight: Orders from Period 1 and Period 2 (141 and 137; total 278) remain in-transit with no concluded arrivals\u2014possible delivery delay; monitor for lost shipments if no arrival by Period 6 conclude.

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
On-hand=0, in-transit=417, and three recent orders (Periods 1\u20133) remain unconcluded \u2192 suggest a delivery delay but no concluded arrivals exist to compute actual lead time. Historical demand samples = [112,97,116,138,94] (mean=111.4). To avoid overreacting to possible transient shipment delays, keep L at promised lead time and use historical demand/volatility for forecasting so the OR backend applies its standard base-stock calculation while we monitor for lost shipments.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period: Period_5. On-hand=0, in-transit=555 (matches orders from Periods 1\u20134). No concluded arrivals yet \u2014 consistent with promised lead time (4 periods): orders placed in Periods 1\u20134 would begin arriving during Periods 5\u20138 and only be visible in conclude messages afterwards. Historical demand samples show no clear regime shift (past demands: [112,97,116,138,94], mean \u2248111.4), so I retain the promised lead time and use defaults that let the OR engine compute demand over the review+lead horizon from the full sample. This balances service level (covers (1+L) periods of expected demand) against holding cost while preserving robustness given uncertain/possibly delayed arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Orders from Periods 1\u20134 (total 555) remain in-transit with no concluded arrivals\u2014possible delivery delay; monitor for lost shipments if no arrival by Period 6 conclude.

=== Period 5 Summary ===
chips(Regular): ordered=9, arrived=141 units (ordered on Period 1, lead_time was 4 periods), starting on-hand inventory=141, demand=51, sold=51, ending on-hand inventory=90
Daily Profit: $102.00, Daily Holding Cost: $90.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $12.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_6: Recent conclude (Period_5) showed arrival=141 from Period_1 with lead_time=4, confirming at least one shipment experienced the promised 4-period lead time. On-hand=90, in-transit=423 (orders from Periods 2\u20135 still en route); no evidence of lost shipments yet. I choose L.method=calculate to set lead time to the average of observed lead times (observed=4). For demand, use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples (leveraging full history and confirmed L=4). This keeps the base-stock aligned with historical demand while the confirmed lead time reduces risk of underordering amid the current in-transit pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (Period_5 conclude: 141 units ordered on Period_1 arrived, lead_time=4). Previous in-transit orders (Periods 2\u20135) remain pending but are not yet delayed beyond confirmed lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-26.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 with on-hand=160 and in-transit=315. Historical demand samples: [112,97,116,138,94] mean=111.4. Concluded arrivals show orders from Periods 1 and 2 had lead_time=4 (Period_5 and Period_6 conclude), confirming actual lead time = 4. Inventory reconciliation: on-hand (160) plus in-transit (315) covers multiple periods of demand; recent in-transit orders (Period3\u20136) should arrive on the 4-period cadence (some arrivals will occur during this period but are only visible next conclude). Decision: set L by calculating observed lead times (use average of observed lead times) to capture confirmed 4-period lead time; keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR backend uses (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples), leveraging full historical demand given no strong evidence of a regime shift. This balances service level (use full-sample mean over the 5-period lead+review horizon) against holding cost given moderate on-hand and substantial in-transit stock.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 snapshot: on-hand=196, in-transit=227. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (arrivals from Orders placed in Periods 1\u20133 all had lead_time=4). Demand history (samples [112,97,116,138,94]) shows no clear recent regime shift. Given confirmed lead time and stable historical demand, use promised/default lead time so OR backend uses L=4. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this balances service level (captures 5-period demand) against holding cost while avoiding overreaction to recent in-transit delays which have been resolved.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-58.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Observed confirmed lead time = 4 periods (Period_5 conclude: order from Period_1 arrived lead_time=4; subsequent Periods 6\u20138 confirms same). On-hand=242, in-transit=192 -> pipeline + on-hand = 434, which covers ~3.9 periods of recent average demand (mean historical demand 111.4). Use lead-time estimate from observed arrivals to match reality and keep forecasting anchored to full sample. Set L by calculating observed lead times to lock in L=4. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level (captures full lead+review demand) against holding cost given stable demand and confirmed lead time.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed lead time = 4 periods based on multiple concluded arrivals (Period_5: Period_1 order arrived lead_time=4; Periods 6\u20138 show same pattern); earlier transient in-transit delays resolved\u2014monitor for any future missing concludes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $49.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent conclude messages consistently show arrived orders with lead_time=4 (Periods 5\u20139 concludes), so actual lead time = 4. On-hand=151 and in-transit=271 provide ample pipeline but demand history is stable (past samples mean \u2248111.4, std moderate). Use lead-time estimate computed from observed concludes to match reality; keep mu_hat and sigma_hat at defaults so backend uses full-sample mean and std scaled by (1+L)=5, which balances service level vs holding cost given confirmed L=4 and steady demand.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Context: Period 11. Historical demand samples for chips(Regular) = [112,97,116,138,94] (mean=111.4). Profit=2, Holding=1 \u2192 q = 2/(2+1) so moderate service level. Confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods from multiple concluded arrivals (Periods 5\u201310). Inventory reconciliation: on-hand=101, in-transit=341 \u2192 total pipeline=442 units. Target coverage (1+L)=5 periods \xd7 mean demand \u2248 557 units, so pipeline+on-hand is ~115 units short and OR should place replenishment. Decision rationale: use promised/default lead time (L="default") because actual lead time has been consistently 4 and promised is 4; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full history, giving a stable baseline forecast and volatility for the capped base-stock rule. This balances service level (using profit-driven q) against holding cost while letting OR cap orders to avoid over-ordering given current large in-transit volume.

Daily Reward (R_t): $214.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (arrivals from orders on Periods 1\u20137 concluded with lead_time=4 in Periods 5\u201311). On-hand = 30 and in-transit = 362 provide ample pipeline but holding cost is nontrivial; no evidence of lost shipments currently. Use default methods so OR backend uses promised lead time and full-sample demand moments ((1+L)\xd7mean, sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) which match confirmed lead time and historical demand variability, balancing service level vs holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained actual lead time = 4 periods (evidence: Period_5 conclude: Period_1 arrival lead_time=4; Periods 6\u201311 concludes show same 4-period lead times).

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Period 13. Demand history (samples) = [112,97,116,138,94]. On-hand=14, in-transit=389. Concluded arrivals across Periods 5\u201312 consistently show lead_time=4 \u2192 actual lead time sustained at 4. No recent lost-shipment signals. Given stable confirmed L=4 and no clear demand regime shift, use conservative defaults so OR backend uses full-sample stats: L default (promised=4, confirmed), mu_hat default ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) to capture demand across review+lead window, sigma_hat default (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) to reflect observed volatility. This balances service (high fill with L+1 cover) against holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14: confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods from multiple concluded arrivals. On-hand=0, in-transit=425 which is below (1+L)*mean demand (5\xd7mean\u2248557), so pipeline is short and we should target full coverage. I select default L to match the promised/confirmed lead time=4, and default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend uses all historical samples (no detected demand regime change) to compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This balances service (cover 5 periods of demand) against holding cost given no new news or seasonality signal.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Context: Period 15 with on-hand=0, in-transit=428. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple concludes Periods 5\u201314 all report lead_time=4). Demand historical samples: [112,97,116,138,94] (mean=111.4). Many earlier in-transit orders have now arrived per confirms; remaining pipeline (428) appears consistent with steady 4-period lead time. Choice: set L to default (promised lead time = 4) because concluded history strongly supports L=4; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7sample mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using full demand history, which is appropriate absent recent demand regime shifts. This balances service (profit $2 vs holding $1) via OR backend's profit/holding tradeoff using full-sample estimates and confirmed lead time, avoiding overreaction to transient pipeline fluctuations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $144.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16: confirmed stable actual lead time = 4 periods from multiple concluded arrivals (Periods 5\u201315 conclude show 4-period lead). Recent demand history (samples used by model): [112,97,116,138,94], mean=111.4. Current inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=462 (covers several future periods). No calendar/news events changing demand. Use promised/default lead time (4) consistent with observed reality. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat to default so OR engine uses full-sample (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std \u2014 conservative, stable forecast given stable demand and confirmed lead time; this balances service level (captures 5-period demand) vs holding cost given already-large pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Sustained actual lead time = 4 periods confirmed by concluded arrivals across Periods 5\u201315 (e.g., Period_5 conclude: Period_1 arrival lead_time=4; repeated in Periods 6\u201315).

Daily Reward (R_t): $260.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Actual lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods by concluded arrivals across Periods 5\u201316. On-hand is 0 and in-transit = 406 (expected arrivals in upcoming periods given L=4). Historical demand samples show stable demand (samples: [112,97,116,138,94]); no strong recent changepoint in demand. To align with confirmed lead time and stable historical demand, use default lead time (promised L=4) so backend uses its lead-time inputs, and default mu_hat/sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This keeps orders sized to cover the review+lead horizon while letting the OR engine balance profit vs holding cost given current statistical estimates and the confirmed L.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19: on-hand=0, in-transit=486. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods across many periods (Periods 5\u201318), so keep promised lead time. Recent demand has trended higher and become more volatile (notably demands 170,213,166 in Periods 16\u201318), so I bias forecast toward recent observations while preserving smoothing to avoid overreacting. Set L=default to use promised 4. Set mu_hat using EWMA (gamma=0.3) to weight recent high demand while retaining longer-run signal for (1+L) period forecast. Set sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture current elevated volatility from the most recent five demand observations. These choices raise the base-stock for higher service with moderate smoothing and increase measured variability to keep the cap aligned with recent risk, balancing profit vs holding cost given large in-transit pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Sustained actual lead time = 4 periods confirmed by concluded arrivals across Periods 5\u201318 (e.g., Period_5 conclude: Period_1 arrival lead_time=4; repeated in Periods 6\u201318).

Historical demand samples mean = 111.4 (from provided five-sample history). To keep the OR engine aligned with confirmed lead time and stable historical demand, use default methods: L=promised (4), mu_hat=(1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples). This ensures the backend computes a base-stock that covers the review+lead horizon while the large in-transit volume limits immediate ordering, balancing service level (profit $2 vs holding $1) against holding cost.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_25: on-hand=0, in-transit=636. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods through Period_24 (e.g., Period_24 conclude: 12 units arrived from Period_20, lead_time=4). Demand seed samples = [112,97,116,138,94]. Given sustained 4-period lead time and no recent structural demand signal, use default methods so OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over all samples. This keeps policy aligned with observed lead time and balances service level vs holding cost by letting the OR engine compute target base-stock from profit/holding ratio and full-sample demand stats. Also note large in-transit volume (636) likely covers several periods of demand; defaults avoid overreacting and reduce holding cost risk.

Carry-over insight: Sustained actual lead time = 4 periods confirmed through Period_24 concludes (example: Period_24 conclude shows arrival of Period_20 order with lead_time=4).

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Confirmed sustained actual lead time = 4 periods based on concludes across Periods 5\u201326. Current inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=556. No recent demand regime shift detected in available samples; pipeline is consistent with L=4. Use default methods so OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this leverages confirmed lead time and historical demand to balance service level vs holding cost.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Context: Period 28. Sustained actual lead time = 4 periods (confirmed through many concludes). On-hand = 0, in-transit = 562 \u2014 significant pipeline stock arriving in upcoming periods. Recent demand regime has shifted upward since ~Period 13 (many demands >> early-sample mean). Evidence: Periods 13\u201327 demands: [102,128,112,170,213,166,231,198,193,176,243,195,185,188,219] (consistently high). Decision: keep L = promised (default) because concluded history strongly supports 4-period lead time. For demand forecast use recent_N to capture the sustained higher-demand regime; choose N=15 covering Periods 13\u201327 (regime length ~15) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean of those 15 recent samples. Use sigma_hat recent_N with same N to reflect elevated variability in the recent regime. This increases orders to meet higher demand while avoiding understock from relying on early low samples. The parameters bias OR backend toward higher base stock (higher service) given profit/holding tradeoff and current large in-transit volume to be absorbed over next periods.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29: on-hand=0, in-transit=598. Historical demand sample (provided) = [112, 97, 116, 138, 94]; concluded arrivals across periods confirm sustained actual lead time = 4 periods. Use L='default' (promised lead time=4) because concluded history matches promise and pipeline is large but arrivals are observed with 4-period lag. Use mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this yields a base-stock that balances service (profit>holding so target fill) while capping orders via the OR cap to avoid over-ordering given sizeable in-transit stock.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_30 decision: confirmed sustained actual lead time = 4 periods from concluded arrivals across Periods 5\u201329. On-hand=0, in-transit=679 (pipeline ample). Using default lead time (promised=4) and default demand estimates because historical concluded data show stable 4-period lead time and no recent demand regime shift warranting a different estimator. Defaults let the OR engine compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given current large pipeline.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Sustained actual lead time = 4 periods (confirmed repeatedly through Period_24 concludes). On-hand=0, in-transit=667 which roughly matches (1+L)*mean demand (5 * 111.4 \u2248 557) so pipeline already covers required cover; risk of holding cost is present but service level is secure. Use default lead time and default demand estimates so OR backend uses promised L and full-sample stats; this avoids overreacting to in-transit inventory and keeps ordering conservative until a changepoint appears.

I use the default methods: keep promised lead time (L default = 4) because multiple concludes across periods confirm a sustained 4-period lead time; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service level (capturing confirmed L and historical mean) against holding cost given large in-transit stock.

Demand seed = provided five-sample history [112,97,116,138,94]; no strong recent changepoint detected. On-hand=63 and in-transit=550 give large pipeline cover; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 35. chips(Regular) profit=$2, holding=$1. On-hand=0, In-transit=682. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods; recent concludes (Periods 5\u201334) confirm L=4. Pipeline (682) provides cover for upcoming 4+1 periods but on-hand is zero so next-period demand will draw from arrivals. I set L to default (use promised lead time = 4) because concluded history matches promised lead time. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to default so the OR engine uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all provided samples; this balances service-level (via base-stock) against holding cost given modest profit/holding ratio.

Carry-over insight: Sustained actual lead time = 4 periods confirmed by concluded arrivals across Periods 5\u201334 (e.g., Period_5 conclude: Period_1 arrival lead_time=4; repeated in subsequent concludes).

Daily Reward (R_t): $288.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_40 start: sustained actual lead time = 4 periods (well-supported by concludes through Period_39). Recent on-hand=0, in-transit=692. Historical sample mean ~111.4 (samples: [112,97,116,138,94]) \u2192 (1+L)*mean \u2248 5\xd7111.4=557 demand over review+lead window. Pipeline (692) exceeds that requirement, so keep the backend's default demand and volatility estimates and use the promised lead time. Using defaults keeps OR engine's base-stock anchored to long-run sample stats while avoiding overreaction to short-term noise; it also leverages the existing in-transit buffer to limit new orders and reduce holding cost.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_41: on-hand=0, in-transit=717. Historical concludes consistently confirm actual lead time = 4 periods. Demand history shows high and variable weekly demand; no new calendar events. To keep the OR engine aligned with observed stable lead time and full-sample demand statistics, use promised/confirmed lead time and default demand estimates so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service (profit>holding) with holding cost given high in-transit stock and confirmed L=4.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 42. Historical concludes consistently confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (repeated arrivals matching orders placed 4 periods earlier). On-hand = 23, in-transit = 596 (large pipeline). Demand history (seed samples) = [112,97,116,138,94]; no strong recent changepoint detected in demand mean/variance. Use promised/confirmed lead time to align pipeline with OR engine assumptions and use default demand estimates derived from full sample set to avoid overreacting to pipeline fluctuation. This balances service (keep coverage for L+1 periods) versus holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

Daily Reward (R_t): $350.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Context: Period_43, sustained actual lead time = 4 periods confirmed by concludes through Period_42. On-hand=0, in-transit=677 units which provides substantial coverage versus recent demand. No fresh calendar/news signals. I choose conservative defaults tied to the promised lead time to let the OR backend use historical demand stats: use default L (promised 4), default mu_hat => (1+L)*mean(all samples) to reflect long-run mean demand, and default sigma_hat => sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples) to reflect observed volatility. This keeps replenishment driven by historical variability while avoiding ad-hoc overrides given stable lead-time evidence and large in-transit stock.

LLM Rationale:
Confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods from concludes across Periods 5\u201343. On-hand=0, in-transit=688 so pipeline large vs demand history (mean\u2248111.4). Use default L to trust supplier promise and conclude evidence; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample set, balancing service level (profit>holding) with current large pipeline to avoid over-ordering.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 45. Historical concludes consistently confirm actual lead time = 4 periods. On-hand=0, in-transit=715 (large pipeline covering multiple lead cycles). Demand history shows no recent regime shift. To let the OR engine use its statistical estimates (which align with observed L=4) and avoid overfitting transient noise, I select defaults: promised lead time (backend uses promised L=4), mu_hat default ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and sigma_hat default (\u221a(1+L)\xd7std of all samples). This keeps the base-stock rule grounded in long-run demand stats and balances service level (use mean+safety) against holding cost given holding/profit ratio.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_46: on-hand=0, in-transit=736. Historical concludes repeatedly confirm sustained actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple concludes from Period_5 onward showing ordered arrival lag=4). Demand context: sample seed demands = [112,97,116,138,94] (mean=111.4). No recent calendar/news signals provided. I use default lead time to match promised/confirmed L=4 and keep demand and volatility estimates based on all available samples so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std consistently. This avoids overfitting to short-term fluctuations while the large in-transit pipeline (736) will be reconciled by the backend's capped ordering rule.

LLM Rationale:

Historical demand series available; no recent changepoint detected that would warrant trimming samples. Use default lead time and full-sample demand estimates so OR backend uses all history to compute base-stock while capping orders; this avoids overreacting to short-term noise given large pipeline.

LLM Rationale:
Period_48: sustained actual lead time = 4 periods evidenced across many concludes. On-hand=0, in-transit=666 \u2014 pipeline is substantial. Demand seed samples available (5 samples). Use default lead time to match proven sustained L=4. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample set, letting OR engine apply its capped order logic given profit/holding tradeoff. This keeps parameters aligned with observed 4-period lead time while relying on historical demand statistics; existing large in-transit quantity should prevent stockouts short-term while OR caps orders to control holding cost.

Recent history shows steady demand variability but no new changepoint. To align with confirmed lead time and avoid overfitting to transient fluctuations, use default lead time and default demand stats (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from samples). This ensures pipeline coverage for (L+1) periods while letting the OR engine compute safety stock vs. holding tradeoff given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

To keep policy aligned with observed lead time and avoid overreacting to transient variation, use promised/default lead time and default demand/volatility calculations so OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std.
