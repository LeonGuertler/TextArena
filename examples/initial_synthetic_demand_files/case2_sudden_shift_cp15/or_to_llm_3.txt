{

Current on-hand = 2, in-transit = 0, so virtually no available stock for Period 49 demand. Recent short-term demand has been ~206 (Periods 36\u201342 and subsequent periods average \u2248206\u2013209; latest demand = 208), so target single-period stock \u2248206. OR recommends 188 but uses older history and the promised L; given confirmed L=0 and recent sustained elevated demand, increase to cover expected one-period demand. Order = target demand (206) \u2212 on-hand (2) = 204 units. This will arrive during Period 49 (since lead time = 0) and satisfy expected demand while keeping minimal holding cost.",

{

Demand outlook: recent periods (44\u201349) demands = [208,204,208,231,208,224], average \u2248210.5; carry-over short-term mean ~206\u2013219 in recent windows supports a higher mean than long-run historical 111. OR recommended 191 (uses promised L and older history). Decision: increase OR's 191 to 210 to align with recent realized demand while avoiding excess holding cost (holding=$1/unit). This balances service (capture more sales at $2 profit/unit) versus holding cost, given low lead time and consistent recent high demand.",
