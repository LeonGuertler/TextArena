{
  "rationale": "Promised L=2 so target coverage = (L+1)=3 periods. Historical single-period mean \u03bc\u0304= (112+97+116+138+94)/5 = 111.4 \u2192 3-period demand \u03bc\u0302\u2248334. OR recommends 59 but uses promised lead time and historical mean only. Current state: on-hand=0, in-transit=523 > \u03bc\u0302 (523 > 334) so pipeline already covers ~2.5\u20133 periods of recent demand. Recent actual demand has been high (~200+/period) but this is already reflected in many outstanding orders (523 units in-transit). Holding cost = $1/unit/period favors avoiding extra inventory buildup. Lead times have varied (1\u20133), but concluded arrivals continue to materialize (most outstanding shipments eventually arrive), so risk of total loss is limited. Therefore place no new order this period to avoid excess holding cost and let in-transit inventory arrive to meet demand.",
