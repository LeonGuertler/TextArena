Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: concluded history confirms lead time = 0 (arrivals occur same period), and there are no in-transit units. Inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=0 so any order placed now will arrive before demand this period. Demand outlook: OR recommends 214 based on historical mean/variance; recent realized demand has risen and stabilized \u2014 last fully observed demands (P46\u2013P49) are 208, 231, 208, 224 with recent 4-period average \u2248218. Profit/holding tradeoff: profit=$4, holding=$1 \u2192 critical fractile q=0.8 (z\u22480.84) implying moderate safety stock but holding cost penalizes large overorders. Decision: increase OR's 214 to 220 to align with recent realized average (~218) while keeping a small buffer for upside spikes. This uses confirmed lead-time=0 (so order covers current period demand) and recent regime evidence. Risk management: modest increase (\u2248+6 units) limits holding cost while reducing expected lost sales if demand repeats recent highs. Follow-up: monitor next 3 periods for sustained change; if demand stays \u2265220, raise base; if drops, reduce orders.",
