Inventory position before arrivals: on-hand=0, in-transit=424. Pipeline vs. target: 424 is ~6 units short of the 430 (L+1)-period target for current elevated demand; small shortfall plus LT variability and demand volatility argue for a modest hedge. OR recommended 104 units (uses promised L=2 and historical mean ~111) \u2014 that recommendation is based on outdated/lower mean and longer promised LT, so it would overreact to older data if followed directly but also would add excess holding cost now. Action rationale: order a small top-up (20 units) to cover the minor shortfall and provide a modest buffer against occasional 2\u20133 period delays while avoiding large holding costs. This keeps total pipeline near the elevated 2-period target without greatly increasing holding cost risk if demand falls.",
