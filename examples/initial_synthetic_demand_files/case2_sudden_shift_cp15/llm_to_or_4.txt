Using initial samples from train.csv: D:\TextArena\examples\initial_synthetic_demand_files\case2_sudden_shift_cp15\train.csv
  Samples: [112, 97, 116, 138, 94]

Promised lead time (shown to LLM): 4 periods (1 period = 14 days)
Note: Actual lead times in CSV may differ and will be inferred by LLM from arrivals.
Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
No concluded arrivals or lead-time observations yet; start at promised lead time. Historical demand samples [112,97,116,138,94] will seed forecasts. Use default lead time (promised L=4) and default mu/sigma so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this balances service level vs holding cost given profit=2 and holding=1 without forcing aggressive changes on period 1 when on-hand=0 and in-transit=0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_2 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=141. Period_1 conclude shows ordered=141 arrived=0 (order placed Period_1). No concluded arrivals yet to infer actual lead time; promised lead time=4 remains best default. Historical demand samples: [112,97,116,138,94]. Use default methods so OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std based on full sample set. This keeps forecasts stable while the outstanding shipment is monitored; if the 141 units never conclude in future periods we'll reassess L (calculate/recent_N) and adjust mu_hat/sigma_hat.

Carry-over insight: Outstanding shipment: 141 units ordered on Period_1 have not arrived by Period_2 conclude (arrived=0); possible delay or lost shipment\u2014monitor for future conclude messages.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=278, two recent orders (Period1:141, Period2:137) have not concluded (arrived=0) \u2014 possible delays/losses but no concluded lead-time observations yet. Demand history (samples=[112,97,116,138,94]) shows mean ~111.4; no clear demand regime change. I retain the promised lead time (use default) because there are no concluded lead-time observations to compute an empirical lead time and lost shipments are not yet confirmed. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample set; this balances service level using the historical mean while avoiding arbitrary explicit overrides given unsettled arrivals.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 decision with on-hand=0 and in-transit=417 (141+137+139 ordered in Periods 1\u20133) and no arrivals observed in Periods 1\u20133 concludes. Historical demand samples = [112,97,116,138,94] mean=111.4. Because no concluded arrivals exist to estimate actual lead time (possible lost/delayed shipments), I keep L at the promised/default to avoid overreacting. Use default demand/volatility estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR engine's base-stock calculation covers (L+1) periods of expected demand while the capped order limits exposure if shipments are lost. Monitor future conclude messages for lead-time inference and adjust if arrivals confirm delay or loss.

Carry-over insight: Outstanding shipments: 417 units ordered on Period_1, Period_2, and Period_3 have not arrived by their concludes (arrived=0 for each); possible delayed or lost shipments\u2014monitor for future conclude messages.

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Outstanding shipments from Periods 1\u20134 remain unconfirmed (arrived=0); no concluded arrivals exist to infer an alternate lead time, so stick with promised lead time. Use default demand estimates based on all historical samples (mean across [112,97,116,138,94]) to cover (1+L) review+lead periods; use default volatility estimate likewise. This keeps the OR engine using its standard (1+L) aggregation and avoids overreacting to possibly lost shipments while ensuring pipeline + orders aim to cover upcoming demand given no confirmed lead-time change.

Daily Profit: $102.00, Daily Holding Cost: $90.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $12.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6: confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (Period 5 conclude: arrived=141 units ordered on Period 1, lead_time was 4). On-hand=90, in-transit=423 (consists of orders from Periods 2-5 still not concluded). Historical demand samples provided; no clear recent demand regime shift. Use promised/default lead time and default demand stats so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std over all samples, balancing service level against holding cost given profit=2 and holding=1.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (evidence: Period 5 conclude: 141 units arrived that were ordered on Period 1, lead_time=4); Outstanding in-transit shipments from Periods 2-4 remain (orders placed in Periods 2-4 have not yet concluded).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-26.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_7: Historical demands = [112,97,116,138,94]. Concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 4 (Period_5 conclude: P1\u2192arrived, lead_time=4; Period_6 conclude: P2\u2192arrived, lead_time=4). Current on-hand=160, in-transit=315; pipeline + on-hand sufficient to cover several periods but in-transit includes outstanding shipments from Periods 2\u20134. I set L using 'calculate' to reflect the observed lead-time regime (average of observed lead times = 4). For demand parameters I use default historical aggregation so the OR engine computes mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples), which balances service level targeting (using full sample mean/variance) against holding cost given confirmed 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (evidence: Period_5 conclude: 141 units arrived ordered on Period_1, lead_time=4; Period_6 conclude: 137 units arrived ordered on Period_2, lead_time=4); Outstanding in-transit shipments from Periods 2\u20134 remain unconfirmed in conclude messages.

Daily Reward (R_t): $10.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Context: Period 8. Recent concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 (Period 5: P1\u2192arrived lead_time=4; Period 6: P2\u21924; Period 7: P3\u21924). Current inventory: on-hand=196, in-transit=227; outstanding in-transit from orders placed in Periods 4\u20137 remain. Demand history (samples) = [112,97,116,138,94] (mean=111.4, std\u224817.61). Decision: set L by averaging observed lead times to capture confirmed 4-period lead time and avoid relying only on promised value; keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as defaults so backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples, which aligns safety stock to observed variability and the 5-period review+lead demand. This balances service level (using actual L) versus holding cost given current healthy on-hand + pipeline coverage.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_9: on-hand=242, in-transit=192. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (arrivals in Periods 5\u20138 correspond to orders from Periods 1\u20134, lead_time=4). Demand history samples = [112,97,116,138,94], mean=111.4. I use default L to match promised lead time and confirmed observations so the OR engine's (1+L) scaling is appropriate. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, ensuring coverage for L+1 periods of demand given current pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $49.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent conclude messages consistently show arrivals with lead_time=4 (Period_5: 141 from P1, Period_6: 137 from P2, Period_7: 139 from P3, Period_8: 138 from P4, Period_9: 9 from P5) \u2014 actual lead time is 4. On-hand=151 and in-transit=271 provide coverage; use calculated L to reflect observed lead time. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (all-sample statistics scaled by 1+L) to let the OR engine compute base-stock from full sample mean/variance given no clear demand regime shift. This balances service (use observed L) against holding cost by relying on historical demand estimates.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (evidence: Period_5 conclude: 141 units arrived ordered on Period_1, lead_time=4; Period_6 conclude: 137 units arrived ordered on Period_2, lead_time=4; Period_7 conclude: 139 units arrived ordered on Period_3, lead_time=4; Period_8 conclude: 138 units arrived ordered on Period_4, lead_time=4).

Daily Reward (R_t): $57.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Context: Period_11. Historical demand samples mean=111.4 (samples [112,97,116,138,94]). Recent conclude messages consistently confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (arrivals for orders placed in Periods 1\u20136 all show lead_time=4). Inventory: on-hand=101, in-transit=341 \u2192 pipeline+on-hand=442, which is below the (1+L)-period demand forecast (~557). Decision: use promised/default lead time (confirmed =4) and default demand/volatility calculations so the OR backend computes base_stock = (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances service level (cover 5 periods of demand) vs holding cost given current confirmed lead time and pipeline shortfall.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple conclude messages show arrivals with lead_time=4). On-hand=30, in-transit=362 \u2014 pipeline large and covers (L+1) periods. Demand history (samples=[112,97,116,138,94]) shows no recent structural change; use default settings so OR backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This keeps service high given ample pipeline while letting backend trade profit ($2) vs holding ($1) via its q formula.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple arrivals: Period_5..Period_8 show lead_time=4). Demand history (samples=[112,97,116,138,94], mean=111.4) and calendar show no additional news. Current inventory: on-hand=14, in-transit=389 \u2192 pipeline+on-hand=403 units, while (1+L)*mean \u22485*111.4=557 units, so pipeline is short of target coverage (L+1 periods). To let the OR engine compute forecasted order quantities with its standard formulas and caps while reflecting the confirmed lead time and historical demand, I set L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat to defaults so backend uses promised/observed lead time and full-sample stats.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_14: on-hand=0, in-transit=425. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple orders with lead_time=4). Use calculated lead time (average observed) to reflect confirmed LT=4. Use default demand and volatility calculations ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) to let the OR engine incorporate the full historical sample set [112,97,116,138,94]. This balances service level (capture confirmed LT and full-sample demand mean) vs holding cost given current large in-transit position.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 15: on-hand=0, in-transit=428. Historical conclues consistently show arrivals for orders placed in Periods 1\u201310 with lead_time=4; evidence supports actual lead time = 4. Demand historical samples (given) show mean \u2248111.4 and moderate variability. I choose L=default (use promised lead time 4), mu_hat=default to let backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean using full sample set, and sigma_hat=default so backend uses sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of full samples. This keeps the OR engine anchored to observed stable lead time and full-sample demand statistics while the large in-transit position (428) will be accounted for by the backend pipeline calculation to avoid over-ordering.

Daily Reward (R_t): $144.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_16: confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods based on multiple conclude messages (arrivals from orders placed in Periods 1\u201312 consistently show lead_time=4). On-hand=0, in-transit=462 \u2014 substantial pipeline arriving in future periods. Demand history samples = [112,97,116,138,94] (mean=111.4). I set L using calculated recent evidence of observed lead times. For forecasting I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this keeps the forecast anchored to full historical demand while the confirmed L=4 ensures cover for the longer review+lead window. This balances service (avoid stockouts given large in-transit and confirmed 4-period lead time) against holding cost by letting OR compute safety stock from global sample variance.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (evidence: multiple conclude messages showing arrivals with lead_time=4 across orders placed in Periods 1\u201312); Current pipeline is large: in-transit=462 units \u2014 expect arrivals over upcoming periods.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_17: actual lead time consistently observed = 4 periods in conclude messages (confirmed across Periods 5\u201316). Current inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=406 \u2014 substantial pipeline arriving in coming periods. Demand history (samples) shows mean ~111.4 units. I use default lead time (promised=4) and default demand volatility/mean (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples) so the OR engine leverages proven LT=4 and full-sample demand statistics; this keeps service-level targeting aligned with observed arrivals while avoiding overreacting to short-term fluctuation.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_18: on-hand=0, in-transit=431. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple arrivals with lead_time=4 across orders placed in Periods 1\u201313+). Recent demand has risen sharply (Period_13\u201317 demands = 102,128,112,170,213) indicating a sustained higher-demand regime starting around Period_13. To capture the confirmed lead time, set L by calculating the average of observed lead times (will be 4). For demand forecast and volatility, use recent_N over the last 5 concluded demand samples to reflect the new higher-mean regime (N=5 covers Period_13\u201317). This keeps the base-stock responsive to the demand uptick while the OR backend balances service level vs holding cost using its standard formula.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (evidence: multiple conclude messages showing arrivals with lead_time=4 for orders placed in Periods 1\u201313+); Recent demand regime shift upward starting ~Period_13 (Period_13\u201317 demands = 102,128,112,170,213).

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19: observed demand has shifted upward starting ~Period 13 (sample demands Period13\u201317 = 102,128,112,170,213). Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods. Current inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=550 (large pipeline expected to arrive over next periods). I keep L at the promised/default 4 (matches confirmed actual lead time) and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture the new higher-demand regime (use the five most recent post-changepoint samples). This biases the base-stock toward higher coverage of upcoming demand while sigma_hat uses the same recent window to reflect increased volatility, helping the OR backend balance service level vs holding cost given the clear regime shift and large pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $212.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Period 20, on-hand=0, in-transit=667. Historical conclude messages consistently confirm actual lead time = 4 periods. Demand shows a clear upward regime starting ~Period_13 (Period_13\u201317 demands: 102,128,112,170,213), so recent demand is materially higher than the original small-sample prior. Reconciliation: large pipeline (667) will arrive over upcoming periods given confirmed L=4, but on-hand is zero so we must plan for (L+1) periods of demand. Decisions: set L=default to use promised lead time (promised=4) because concludes confirm actual=4; set mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture the recent higher-demand regime (focus on the last 5 periods of observed demand to scale (1+L) mean upward); set sigma_hat using recent_N N=5 to reflect current volatility in the recent regime. These choices bias the OR backend toward higher base stock and higher caps to protect service during the new, higher-demand regime while acknowledging the large in-transit pipeline to avoid unnecessary extra ordering.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple conclude messages across orders); Large pipeline in-transit = 667 units \u2014 expect arrivals over upcoming periods; Recent demand regime shift upward beginning ~Period_13 (Period_13\u201317 demands: 102,128,112,170,213).

LLM Rationale:
On-hand=0, in-transit=848. Concluded history consistently shows actual lead time = 4 periods. Recent demand rose starting ~Period_13 (higher demands), but historical seed samples (provided) are limited. To remain consistent with confirmed lead time and let the OR engine apply its statistical policy, use promised lead time and default demand/statistics so backend computes base_stock from full sample statistics. Large pipeline expected to arrive over next periods and will be balanced by OR cap. Monitor future concludes for any lost shipments or sustained demand regime changes\u2014if upward demand persists, switch to a recent_N or EWMA update for mu_hat in subsequent periods.

LLM Rationale:

Demand has been elevated since ~Period_13 (e.g., Period_13\u201321 demands: 102,128,112,170,213,166,231,198,193) so I weight recent demand more. Use promised/default L=4. Use EWMA (gamma=0.3) for mu_hat to adapt to upward shift while smoothing noise. Use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $307.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Lead time: confirmed at 4 periods by multiple conclude messages (arrivals from orders placed in Periods 1\u201318 consistently show lead_time=4). Demand: a sustained upward regime began around Period_13 (Period_13\u201317 demands = 102,128,112,170,213) with recent 5-period demands = [166,231,198,193,176] (Periods 18\u201322). Current inventory: on-hand=45, in-transit=714 (large pipeline will deliver over next periods). To capture the new higher-demand regime while respecting the promised lead time, I keep L as default (use promised 4) and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 so the OR engine targets (1+L)-period demand and recent volatility rather than stale early-sample statistics. This balances service (higher forecast to avoid stockouts) against holding cost given the already-large pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (evidence: multiple conclude messages showing arrivals with lead_time=4 for orders placed in Periods 1\u201318). Sustained upward demand regime beginning ~Period_13 (example demands Period_13\u201317: 102,128,112,170,213; recent Period_18\u201322: 166,231,198,193,176).

Demand has shifted upward beginning ~Period_13 (evidence in Period_13\u201323 demands), but historical seed samples provided to OR are the five-sample series. Decision: keep L at promised (default) because concludes consistently show L=4 and pipeline is large; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, avoiding overreaction to recent volatility while pipeline clears.

Set L to default (promised lead time = 4) since actual lead time is consistently 4. Set mu_hat using recent_N to reflect the post-change higher demand (N=12 covering Period_13\u201324). Set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=12) to capture elevated variability. These choices raise the OR base-stock to meet higher demand while sigma estimate increases safety stock to preserve service level; using recent_N avoids diluting the new regime with older low-demand samples and aligns ordering with the large in-transit pipeline to avoid understocking.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed lead time = 4 periods (evidence: multiple conclude messages up to Period_24). Sustained upward demand regime beginning ~Period_13; recent Period_13\u201324 demands: 102,128,112,170,213,166,231,198,193,176,243,195. Current pipeline large: in-transit=466 units; on-hand=85.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple conclude messages). Demand shifted up starting ~Period_13 (Period_13\u201324 demands show higher mean vs. earlier). On-hand is 0, in-transit=717 \u2014 large pipeline will deliver over next periods given L=4. Set L to promised/default (4) consistent with observed confirmed lead time. Use recent_N for demand estimates to capture the sustained upward regime; chose N=12 to cover Period_13\u201324 (regime_length \u224812) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect current higher mean and volatility. These parameters steer the OR backend to a higher base-stock (improving service during elevated demand) while sigma_hat from recent data controls safety-stock to limit excess holding given $1/period holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Sustained upward demand regime beginning ~Period_13 (evidence: Period_13\u201324 demands = 102,128,112,170,213,166,231,198,193,176,243,195); Confirmed lead time = 4 periods across many concluded orders; Current pipeline large (in-transit=717) and will arrive over upcoming periods.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Period_27. Confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods from multiple conclude messages through Period_26. Recent sustained upward demand regime beginning ~Period_13 (Period_13\u201326 demands show higher mean vs earlier periods). On-hand=48, in-transit=722 (large pipeline arriving over next periods). Decision: keep L as default (promised lead time=4) because concludes confirm LT=4; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the upward-demand regime to capture the new higher mean and volatility (N=14 covers Period_13\u201326). These parameters will raise the base-stock to meet higher demand while accounting for increased variability, balancing service level vs holding cost given large pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed lead time = 4 periods (evidence: repeated conclude messages through Period_26); Sustained upward demand regime beginning ~Period_13 (Period_13\u201326 demands: higher mean and volatility); Current pipeline large (in-transit=722) and will materially replenish inventory over upcoming periods.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_28: confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple conclude messages). Recent demand regime shifted up beginning ~Period_13 (higher mean and volatility through Period_27). On-hand=59, in-transit=655 \u2014 large pipeline will replenish over next periods. To capture the sustained higher demand, set lead time to promised default=4, and use recent_N estimates for demand mean and volatility using the recent regime (N=15 covering ~Period_13\u201327) so the backend raises base-stock to meet higher demand while accounting for increased variability.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed lead time = 4 periods (evidence: repeated conclude messages through Period_27); Sustained upward demand regime beginning ~Period_13 (e.g., Period_13\u201327 shows higher mean and volatility); Current pipeline large (in-transit=655) and will materially replenish inventory over upcoming periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $118.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_29: on-hand=0, in-transit=887. Historical conclude messages consistently confirm actual lead time = 4 periods. Demand exhibited a sustained upward regime beginning around Period_13 (Period_13\u201328 shows higher mean/volatility than earlier samples). To align ordering with recent demand, keep L at the promised/default (confirmed =4) and set demand estimates using recent data from the post-changepoint regime. Chose recent_N with N=16 (Periods 13\u201328) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained higher mean and volatility; this balances service level (avoid stockouts given large observed demand) against holding cost by letting the OR backend compute base_stock from the recent regime statistics.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed lead time = 4 periods (evidence: repeated conclude messages showing arrivals with lead_time=4 across many orders through Period_28); Sustained upward demand regime beginning ~Period_13 (evidence: higher demands Period_13\u201328; recent burst values include 102,128,112,170,213,166,231,198,193,176,243,195,188,219,213); Current pipeline large: in-transit=887 \u2014 expect material arrivals over upcoming periods.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods from multiple conclude messages; current on-hand=36 and in-transit=705 so substantial arrivals expected over next periods. Demand has shifted upward beginning ~Period_13; to capture recent regime I use a recent_N forecast for mu_hat with N=5 (captures the most recent burst of higher demand). Keep L at promised (default) since concluded evidence consistently shows 4. Use default sigma_hat so backend scales volatility across the (1+L) horizon.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods from many conclude messages. Recent sustained upward demand regime beginning ~Period_13 (evidence: Period_13\u201330 demands show higher mean and volatility versus earlier periods). Current inventory: on-hand=62, in-transit=756 \u2014 large pipeline will replenish over next periods. To match the observed regime, set L to default (promised lead time=4). For demand forecast and volatility use recent_N over the identified upward regime to capture higher mean and variability; I choose N=18 (Period_13\u201330 \u2248 18 periods) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the new regime and avoid underordering. These parameters bias the OR backend toward higher base-stock to maintain service during elevated demand while capping orders via the OR engine's cap to limit excess holding given holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed lead time = 4 periods (multiple conclude messages through Period_30); Sustained upward demand regime beginning ~Period_13 (evidence: elevated demands Period_13\u201330); Current pipeline large: in-transit=756, on-hand=62.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Lead time: multiple conclude messages through Period_31 consistently show arrivals with lead_time=4, so keep promised/default lead time. Demand: historical series shows a sustained upward regime beginning ~Period_13 (higher mean and volatility from Period_13\u201331). Current inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=747 \u2014 large pipeline will materially replenish inventory over next periods. I set L=default to reflect confirmed 4-period lead time; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=19 (regime from Period_13\u201331 length=19) so the OR backend targets the elevated recent mean and volatility over the review+lead window, improving service during higher demand while controlling holding cost given the large pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed lead time = 4 periods (evidence: repeated conclude messages through Period_31). Sustained upward demand regime beginning ~Period_13 (evidence: elevated demands in Period_13\u201331). Current pipeline large: in-transit=747, on-hand=0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $326.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_33: confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (consistent concludes through Period_32). Demand has shifted to a higher regime starting ~Period_13 (elevated mean and volatility in Period_13\u201332). Current inventory: on-hand=46, in-transit=768 \u2014 large pipeline will replenish over next periods. Given stable confirmed lead time, use default promised L to match supplier promise; for demand and volatility use recent_N over the detected upward regime to capture the new higher mean and variability (regime Period_13\u201332, length=20). This raises base stock to cover (1+L) periods of the higher demand while reflecting increased sigma to avoid stockouts, balancing profit vs holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed lead time = 4 periods (evidence: repeated conclude messages through Period_32 showing lead_time=4); Sustained upward demand regime beginning ~Period_13 (evidence: Period_13\u201332 higher mean and volatility). Current pipeline large: in-transit=768, on-hand=46.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:

To protect service while avoiding excess holding cost I keep L as promised (default) and set demand forecasts to a recent-window that captures the new regime. Using recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat captures the elevated mean and volatility from the last ~20 periods so the OR backend's base-stock and cap reflect current demand.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Context: Period_35. Confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods from many concluded arrivals. Recent sustained upward demand regime beginning ~Period_13 (higher mean and volatility). Current inventory: on-hand=121, in-transit=720 \u2014 substantial pipeline that will arrive over upcoming periods. Risk: elevated demand vs. large pipeline; maintain service while avoiding excess holding. Decisions: set L to default (use promised lead time = 4) since conclude history consistently shows lead_time=4. For demand forecast (mu_hat) use recent_N to capture the sustained higher-demand regime; choose N=20 to reflect the recent ~Period_13+ regime while capping at 20. For sigma_hat use recent_N with N=20 to capture elevated volatility in the same recent window. These parameters steer the OR backend to compute a base-stock aligned to the recent higher mean and volatility while accounting for the 4-period lead time and the large pipeline, balancing fill rate against holding cost.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_36: on-hand=53, in-transit=745. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (many concluded arrivals with lead_time=4 through Period_35). Demand has shifted to a higher regime beginning ~Period_13 (Period_13\u201335 shows elevated mean and volatility). To reflect the sustained higher demand while using concluded evidence for lead time, set L to promised (default=4) and use recent_N with N=20 for demand mean and volatility to capture the most recent regime (capped at 20 samples). This keeps pipeline coverage aligned with L=4 while increasing target base-stock to meet the elevated demand and the OR backend's uncertainty estimate.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (consistent conclude messages). Recent sustained upward demand regime beginning ~Period_13; use recent data to capture higher mean/volatility. Current inventory: on-hand=66, in-transit=735 \u2014 large pipeline will arrive but lead time is long, so order decisions must cover (1+L) demand. Set L=default (promised 4). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=20 to reflect the new higher-demand regime (N chosen = min(regime_length,20) with regime starting ~Period_13). This raises the base-stock target to reduce stockouts while sigma_hat from recent variability keeps safety stock appropriate.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed lead_time=4 periods (many conclude messages through Period_36); Sustained upward demand regime beginning ~Period_13 (evidence: elevated demands Period_13\u201336); Current pipeline large: in-transit=735, on-hand=66.

On-hand=53 and in-transit=804 \u2014 pipeline will materially replenish inventory over the next periods.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent history shows confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods across many concluded orders and a sustained upward demand regime beginning ~Period_13 (higher mean and volatility through Period_38). On-hand is low (13) but pipeline is large (872) and will arrive over upcoming periods. I set L=default to use the promised lead time (matches observed actual LT=4). For demand I use recent_N (N=20) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime while limiting older low-demand data influence. I set sigma_hat recent_N (N=20) to reflect elevated volatility in the same recent window. These choices raise the base-stock to cover the higher recent demand and properly size safety stock while avoiding overreacting to earlier low-demand samples given large incoming pipeline.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period=40. Confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods from multiple conclude messages. Recent sustained upward demand regime began ~Period_13 (higher mean and volatility) and pipeline is large (in-transit=863) with low on-hand (21). To respect proven lead time I use the promised/default L=4 so OR backend aligns with observed arrivals. Demand estimate: use recent_N on the available samples (N=5) to let the backend upweight recent observed demand rather than older priors given the sustained upward regime. Volatility: use default scaling so safety stock reflects full-sample std scaled by sqrt(1+L). These choices aim to maintain service (avoid stockouts given confirmed L and rising demand) while letting the OR cap limit overly-large orders to control holding cost.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period=41. History shows consistent actual lead time = 4 periods (many conclude messages). Recent long-run demand elevated vs. the 5-sample prior, but the provided historical demand dataset for parameter seeding is the five-sample series. On-hand=41, in-transit=789 \u2192 large pipeline will replenish over next periods. To let the OR engine use its default statistical aggregation (which matches the dataset provided and confirmed promised lead time), I select default lead time and default demand/volatility calculations so the engine computes base_stock from (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std of the provided samples. This keeps orders aligned with confirmed L=4 while avoiding overfitting short-term spikes given pipeline fullness and holding cost=$1/unit.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_42: confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple concluded arrivals show lead_time=4). Demand has been in a sustained higher regime beginning ~Period_13 (elevated means and volatility across Period_13\u201341). Current inventory: on-hand=67, in-transit=552 \u2014 large pipeline will replenish over the next periods. I keep L as default (use promised lead time = 4) because concluded history consistently shows lead_time=4. For demand forecast I focus on the recent high-demand regime: use recent_N with N=20 (captures the most recent ~20 periods of the elevated regime while respecting the N cap). Use the same recent_N=20 for sigma_hat to reflect current higher volatility. These choices direct the OR backend to size base-stock and cap using recent elevated mean and volatility, balancing service level (avoid stockouts in the higher-demand regime) against holding costs given the already-large pipeline.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 43: confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (many concluded arrivals with lead_time=4). Demand has been in a sustained higher regime since ~Period_13; pipeline is large (in-transit=607) and on-hand=46. To reflect the sustained upward regime I use recent_N for demand estimates with N=20 (captures most recent elevated samples while capping at 20). Lead time set to default (promised = 4) since concludes consistently show 4. Using recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat focuses the OR base-stock on the recent higher mean and volatility so orders replenish to meet the elevated demand while the large pipeline moderates immediate ordering.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_44: on-hand=40, in-transit=691. Multiple conclude messages confirm actual lead time=4 periods. Demand has shifted to a higher, more volatile regime beginning ~Period_13 (sustained elevated demands in Period_13\u201343). Large pipeline will replenish inventory over upcoming periods. Set L to default (use promised 4) consistent with confirmed lead time. Use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained upward demand regime and increased volatility (focus on the most recent 20 demand observations) so the OR backend raises the base-stock and safety stock to balance higher service-level needs against holding cost given current large pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed lead_time=4 periods (evidence: many conclude messages showing arrivals with lead_time=4 through Period_43); Sustained upward demand regime beginning ~Period_13 (evidence: elevated demands Period_13\u201343); Current pipeline large: in-transit=691, on-hand=40.

Current period=45. Demand has shown a sustained upward regime beginning ~Period_13 (higher mean & volatility); confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods through many conclude messages. Inventory: on-hand=1, in-transit=772 (large pipeline arriving over next periods). To capture the sustained higher-demand regime I set L to default (promised 4, which matches confirmed actual lead time) and use recent_N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the order-up-to calculation on the most recent 20 demand observations (N=20 chosen because the upward regime length >20; N capped at 20). This biases the backend toward a higher base-stock to avoid stockouts given large recent demand while relying on the OR engine cap to limit overly large single-period orders and control holding cost.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Current period 46. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods across many concluded orders; pipeline is large (in-transit=1007) and on-hand is 0. Demand has shifted up starting ~Period_13; I use recent samples to reflect the new higher-demand regime. Choose L=default to trust promised lead time (matches observed 4). Set mu_hat using recent_N (N=20) to base the (1+L) demand forecast on the most recent 20 demands capturing the sustained upward regime. Set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=20) to capture current higher volatility and ensure safety stock aligns with recent variability while avoiding overreacting to older low-demand periods. This balances service level (avoid stockouts given large pipeline arrivals) against holding cost by using recent regime stats rather than all-time averages.

LLM Rationale:

Demand has shifted up starting ~Period_13 and recent periods show higher mean and volatility. I choose L='default' (use promised 4) because concludes repeatedly verify LT=4. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=20 to focus the OR forecast on the most recent high-demand regime (N capped at 20 per rules), so the backend's base-stock and cap reflect the elevated mean and volatility and avoid under-ordering given the large pipeline and upcoming arrivals.

=== Period 48 Summary ===

Daily Reward (R_t): $306.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (consistent concluded arrivals across many periods). Demand has a sustained upward regime beginning ~Period_13; use recent-window estimates to capture higher mean and volatility. Set L to default (promised 4). Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the post-changepoint regime; choose N=12 to cover roughly Period_37\u201348 (recent elevated demands) while keeping sample >=3 and capturing current volatility. This increases base_stock to meet higher demand while sigma_hat recent_N raises safety stock to balance service level vs holding cost given high pipeline (in-transit=746) and on-hand=110.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed lead time = 4 periods (evidence: repeated conclude messages showing arrivals with lead_time=4 across many orders through Period_48); Sustained upward demand regime beginning ~Period_13 (evidence: elevated demands Period_13\u201348; recent burst in Period_37\u201348).

Daily Reward (R_t): $312.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple conclude messages showing arrivals with lead_time=4 through Period_49). Demand has a sustained upward regime beginning ~Period_13 (higher mean and volatility across Period_13\u201349). To respect proven lead time, keep L at the promised/default. To capture the elevated recent demand, set mu_hat using a recent_N estimate over the last 20 demand observations so the OR engine targets higher inventory for the (1+L) review+lead window. Use recent_N for sigma_hat (N=20) so safety stock reflects recent higher volatility.
