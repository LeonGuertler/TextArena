Prior carry-over already confirmed a higher regime (avg ~196 from P16\u2013P20 and sustained). Conservatively forecast demand = 210 units/period. Lead time & pipeline: lead time confirmed = 4 periods (from histories). When ordering in Period 48 we must cover L+1 = 5 periods of demand (current period demand occurs after decision). Required coverage = 210 * 5 = 1,050 units. Current coverage = on-hand 9 + in-transit 793 = 802 units. Shortage = 1,050 - 802 = 248 units. Tradeoff: holding cost $1/period vs. lost profit ($4) if stockout; order to bring pipeline near 5-period cover. Final order: 250 units (rounding up slightly to provide small safety margin).",
