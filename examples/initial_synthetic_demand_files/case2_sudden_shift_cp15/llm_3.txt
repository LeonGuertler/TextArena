Demand regime: Periods 25\u201348 show sustained high demand averaging \u2248205 units/period; use \u2248205\u2013210 as forecast. Lead time & pipeline: historical concludes show lead_time variability 1\u20133 periods and some lost/overdue shipments; treat in-transit as partially unreliable but count it toward coverage until a conclude indicates loss. Inventory assessment: On-hand=0, In-transit=823 which exceeds (L+1)=3 periods demand need (~205\xd73\u2248615). Ordering logic: With pipeline already covering the next ~3 periods, placing additional order risks extra holding cost ($1/unit/period) without increasing immediate sales (profit $2/unit). Therefore place no order this period and wait for concludes to confirm actual arrivals before replenishing.",
