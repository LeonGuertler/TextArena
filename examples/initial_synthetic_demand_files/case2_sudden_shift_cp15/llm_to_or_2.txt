Using initial samples from train.csv: D:\TextArena\examples\initial_synthetic_demand_files\case2_sudden_shift_cp15\train.csv
  Samples: [112, 97, 116, 138, 94]
  Mean: 111.4, Count: 5
Promised lead time (shown to LLM): 2 periods
Note: Actual lead times in CSV may differ and will be inferred by LLM from arrivals.
Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. Historical demand samples: [112,97,116,138,94] (mean=111.4). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no concluded arrivals so no evidence of altered lead time or lost shipments. Promised lead time is 2 periods; no changepoint detected in demand. Use default lead time to rely on promised L=2 and default aggregation for mu_hat and sigma_hat so OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample. This balances service level (using full-sample mean) against holding cost with no signal to inflate safety stock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_2 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=141 (order from Period_1), Period_1 conclude shows arrived=0 for that order. Historical demands = [112,97,116,138,94] (mean=111.4). No concluded arrivals yet to compute actual lead time; the single outstanding order may be delayed/lost but evidence is insufficient to change lead-time estimate. Use promised lead time (default) and default demand/variance calculations so OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std based on full sample, balancing service level vs holding cost given current uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Outstanding order of 141 units placed Period_1 has not concluded (Period_1 conclude: arrived=0); possible delayed or lost shipment\u2014monitor for further concludes.

Daily Profit: $148.00, Daily Holding Cost: $67.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $81.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 start: we observed Period 2 conclude showing the Period 1 order (141) arrived with lead_time=1. Pipeline shows in-transit=137 and on-hand=67. Historical demand samples = [112,97,116,138,94] (mean=111.4). No clear demand regime shift; use inferred actual lead time to set review horizon. Set L via observed lead times to reflect actual faster arrivals (1). Use default aggregation for mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing a stable base-stock that covers (L+1) periods of demand while controlling holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Observed actual lead time = 1 period (Period 2 conclude: arrived=141 units ordered on Period 1, lead_time was 1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $134.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4: on-hand=0, in-transit=157. Historical demand samples = [112,97,116,138,94]; recent concludes show one observed lead_time=1 (Period 2 conclude). There is evidence of a shorter actual lead time than the promised 2, but limited observations (single sample). Choose L='calculate' so backend uses observed lead times average (captures the observed 1). Use mu_hat and sigma_hat 'default' so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples\u2014this is conservative given limited lead-time evidence and smooths demand estimates while accounting for L. This balances service level (uses observed shorter lead time) versus holding cost by not overfitting to small demand fluctuations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $235.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_5 snapshot: on-hand=13, in-transit=90. Concluded lead-times: 1 (Period2 conclude) and 2 (Period4 conclude) \u2192 mixed regime; use averaged lead time. No currently missing shipments (in-transit 90 = orders from Period3+Period4). Demand history samples = [112,97,116,138,94]. Choose L by calculating average of observed lead times to reflect recent variability. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level (via higher L) against holding cost given moderate demand variability.

Carry-over insight: Observed lead times: 1 (order on Period_1 arrived Period_2) and 2 (order on Period_2 arrived Period_4); average observed lead time = 1.5 periods \u2014 treat lead time regime as mixed/unstable until more data.

Daily Profit: $26.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $26.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_6: recent observed lead times = {1,2} (arrivals in Period_2 and Period_4) indicating a mixed/unstable lead-time regime; choose recent_N L to reflect latest evidence. On-hand=0, in-transit=230; historical demand mean=111.4 (samples [112,97,116,138,94]). Using L=recent_N(2) captures observed average lead time (1.5) so mu_hat default will scale demand across review+lead. Pipeline (230) is slightly below (1+L)*mean \u2248 278.5, so backend will raise orders toward the capped base-stock to balance service vs holding cost given Profit=$2, Holding=$1.

Carry-over insight: Observed lead times = 1 (order P1\u2192arrived P2) and 2 (order P2\u2192arrived P4); average 1.5 \u2192 mixed/unstable lead-time regime; monitor for further concludes to confirm trend.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7: on-hand=0, in-transit=276, observed lead times from concluded messages = [1 (P1\u2192P2), 2 (P2\u2192P4)] -> mixed/unstable with average 1.5. Use recent_N for L (N=2) to reflect the short sample of observed lead times rather than blindly trusting promised L=2. Demand history mean = 111.4 (samples [112,97,116,138,94]); keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using the chosen L, balancing service level against holding cost while accommodating observed lead-time instability. Monitoring: outstanding in-transit 276 may include late arrivals; parameters chosen are conservative given mixed lead-time regime.

Daily Profit: $206.00, Daily Holding Cost: $83.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $123.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8: on-hand=83, in-transit=90. Historical demands [112,97,116,138,94] show mean ~111.4 and moderate variance; recent arrivals indicate mixed lead times of 1 and 2 periods (avg 1.5). To account for the unstable but recent pattern, set lead-time using recent_N over the 2 most recent observed lead times. Use default demand & volatility aggregation so OR backend applies (1+L) scaling consistently. This balances service (by increasing effective L) against holding cost given current healthy on-hand + pipeline.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_9: on-hand=0, in-transit=232. Historical concluded lead times = {P1\u2192P2:1, P2\u2192P4:2, P5\u2192P7:2, P6\u2192P7:1} \u2192 average 1.5 (mixed/unstable). Demand history mean=111.4 from samples [112,97,116,138,94]. To balance service vs holding cost given mixed lead-time evidence, set L to the calculated average lead time so the OR engine accounts for observed variability; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so forecasts use all historical demand data scaled by (1+L). This keeps orders responsive while letting the backend compute safety stock from full-sample variance.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime mixed/unstable; observed lead times = [1,2,2,1], average = 1.5 (4 concluded orders) \u2014 treat as persistent short+multi-period mix until further concludes.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10: on-hand=0, in-transit=266. Historical concluded lead times = [1,2,2,1] (4 concluded orders), average=1.5 => mixed/unstable short+multi-period lead-time regime. Choose L via recent_N (N=4) to reflect this recent mix. Demand history samples = [112,97,116,138,94]; use recent_N N=5 for mu_hat to base forecast on all available demand while scaling by (1+L). Use default sigma_hat so backend computes volatility across all samples scaled by sqrt(1+L). These choices bias the base-stock toward covering (1+~1.5) periods of demand given mixed lead times and large in-transit volume, while letting the OR engine cap orders to avoid excessive holding given holding cost=$1 and profit=$2.

Observed concluded lead times = [1,2,2,1] (avg 1.5) \u2014 regime mixed/unstable but useful signal. Use L.method="calculate" to let backend average observed lead times (captures the 1/2 mix). Keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as "default" so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from full sample set; this is conservative given limited data and avoids overfitting to recent volatility while ensuring pipeline + on-hand target covers (L+1) periods of demand.

Use L="calculate" to let backend average observed lead times (captures 1.5). Demand seed from provided samples (mean=111.4) with no clear recent demand regime change, so use default forecasting formulas: mu_hat and sigma_hat set to "default" so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This balances service level (accounting for elevated effective review+lead demand when L>1) vs holding cost while acknowledging lead-time instability and sizeable in-transit stock.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=0, in-transit=272 (~2.4 periods of demand at ~111/period), so pipeline is substantial but some earlier orders showed delayed arrival behavior\u2014treat lead time as uncertain and let backend compute average observed L. Use data-driven defaults for \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 so backend applies (1+L) scaling to full-sample mean/std, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=2 and holding=1.

Use lead-time estimate that reflects observed average to capture this mixture (calculate). Use default demand aggregation for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine applies (1+L)\xd7sample mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over full history, giving a conservative base-stock that balances service vs holding given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_15: on-hand=0, in-transit=267. Historical concluded lead times show variability with recent concludes (orders from P11\u2192P14) giving lead times [3,2,1]. Demand has trended slightly higher in recent periods (Periods 11\u201314 demands = [122,119,102,128], mean \u2248117.75) versus the earlier 5-sample prior. To balance service (profit $2 vs holding $1) under mixed/unstable lead times, I use a recent estimate for L (captures the latest lead-time regime) and recent demand stats (focus on the most recent stable demand window) so the OR backend's base-stock reflects current higher demand while limiting excess inventory given lead-time uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime remains mixed/unstable with occasional 3-period delays; last 3 concluded lead times = [3,2,1] (orders P11\u2013P13\u2192arrived P14).

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_16: on-hand=0, in-transit=402. Historical concluded lead times show recent variability with last concluded lead times = [2,1,3,2] (average 2.0) indicating a shift toward longer/more 2\u20133 period delays. Demand history samples mean=111.4 (5 samples). Given large in-transit stock (402 > expected (1+L)*mean) and mixed but recently longer lead times, set L by recent_N (N=4) to capture the latest regime; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend uses full-sample demand stats scaled by (1+L). This keeps orders conservative (pipeline already heavy) while aligning safety stock to slightly longer observed lead time.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime shifted recently: last 4 concluded lead times = [2,1,3,2], average = 2.0 \u2192 treat lead time as trending longer (2 periods) until further concludes confirm.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_17: on-hand=0, in-transit=267. Historical concluded lead times = [1,2,2,1,3,2,1,1] (avg 1.625) with recent pattern showing longer tails. To balance service vs holding cost I treat lead time as short-but-mixed and use a recent-N estimate (N=4) to capture the recent upward drift while letting the OR engine compute demand coverage using the standard demand stats. Using default mu_hat/sigma_hat lets the backend apply (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples given limited reliable post-stockout demand data.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime: mixed with recent upward drift. Last 8 concluded lead_times=[1,2,2,1,3,2,1,1] (avg=1.625); last 4 lead_times=[3,2,1,1] (avg=1.75) \u2014 treat lead time as trending slightly longer; monitor further concludes.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_18: on-hand=0, in-transit=337. Historical concluded lead times are mixed but show a recent upward drift; I therefore set L by averaging recent concluded lead times to capture the current regime. Use default demand/volatility aggregation so OR backend applies (1+L) scaling to the full-sample mean/std. This balances higher effective lead time (reducing stockouts) against holding costs given large in-transit volume.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19. Demand history shows frequent stockouts and high variability (recent demands large: 128,170,213,166). Observed lead times have been mixed and drifting slightly longer; use calculated average lead time to capture the mixed regime rather than trusting promised 2. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine applies (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std over all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given high demand volatility and current in-transit=316 units.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime mixed/unstable with recent upward drift; use average observed lead time until further concludes confirm a new regime.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_20: on-hand=0, in-transit=287. Historical concludes show a mixed but recently lengthening lead-time regime (recent concludes include multiple 2\u20133 period delays). To respond to the recent upward drift while remaining responsive to mixed signals, set L by averaging the most recent concluded lead times (recent_N, N=4). Demand history is limited to the provided samples; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine applies (1+L) scaling to the full-sample mean/std, letting it balance service vs holding given the chosen L.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime: mixed with recent upward drift; prioritize recent average (N=4) until further concludes confirm a new steady state.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_21: on-hand=0, in-transit=325 (large pipeline). Concluded lead-times are mixed but recent concludes show upward drift; to capture recent regime I set L using recent_N with N=4 (prioritize recent observed lead-times). Demand seed data available = [112,97,116,138,94] (mean\u2248111.4). Given large pipeline and limited sample set, use default mu_hat and default sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample, letting the backend cap orders while respecting recent lead-time estimate. This balances avoiding excess new orders (pipeline already 325) against service-level risk from slightly longer recent lead-times.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_22 decision. On-hand=0, in-transit=334. Concluded lead times show a mixed/unstable regime with recent upward drift (see carry_over); average of all concluded lead_times \u22481.64 but recent windows show ~1.75\u20132.0. I prioritize recent behaviour to guard against longer deliveries: set L via recent_N (N=4) to reflect recent upward drift. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (use all demand samples) so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the full demand sample set, balancing service level (higher L raises base stock) versus holding cost. In-transit=334 provides a substantial buffer, so defaults for demand stats avoid overreacting to short-term noise.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time still mixed/unstable but recent concluded lead times (11 concluded total) give average \u22481.636; recent window evidence indicates slight upward drift\u2014treat regime as mixed-with-upward-drift and prioritize recent average (N=4) until further concludes.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23: on-hand=0, in-transit=283. Historical concluded lead times are mixed with slight upward drift; recent concludes include 3 and 2-period delays. I prioritize recent lead-time evidence for L and use a recent demand window to capture the higher recent demand runs. Choices: L via recent_N N=4 to reflect recent lead-time mix/upward drift; mu_hat via recent_N N=8 to capture recent increased demand levels across the review+lead horizon; sigma_hat default to let backend compute volatility from full history. This balances service (covering mixed/longer lead times) against holding cost given large in-transit stock.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_24: on-hand=0, in-transit=524. Historical concluded lead_times are mixed with recent upward drift; recent-window evidence favors using a short recent average to capture current longer tail. Demand has stepped up versus the initial small-sample prior\u2014use recent demand window to reflect the higher recent demands. Chosen methods: L as recent_N (N=4) to prioritize the last 4 concluded lead times and capture the recent upward drift; mu_hat as recent_N (N=5) to scale forecast by the most recent 5 demand observations (captures elevated demand); sigma_hat as recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These settings let the OR engine raise base-stock to protect service under slightly longer effective lead-times while using recent demand/volatility so orders aren\u2019t oversized given substantial in-transit inventory.

Recent demand has been high and volatile (last 5 demands = [198,193,176,243,195], mean=201). To prioritize service amid rising lead times and strong demand, set lead-time to recent_N (N=4) and base demand estimates on the most recent 5 periods to capture the current high-demand regime while letting the OR engine compute safety stock from variance.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27: on-hand=0, in-transit=368. Historical concluded lead-times are mixed with recent upward drift; recent window (last 4 concluded) supports using a short but variable lead time ~2. Use recent_N for L (N=4) to prioritize recent regime. Demand seed samples are limited and mixed; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend uses all samples scaled by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L). This balances service vs holding given profit=$2, holding=$1 and uncertain lead-time and occasional lost/delayed shipments.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date Period_28. On-hand=0, in-transit=377. Observed concluded lead-times are mixed with a recent upward drift (multiple 2\u20133 period delays including Period_24\u2192Period_27 lead_time=3). Demand has been high recently (recent period demands: 243,195,185,188,219). To hedge against longer/mixed lead times use a recent-average L and base forecasts on the most recent high-demand regime to avoid stockouts while controlling holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime trending longer/mixed: recent concludes include 2\u20133 period delays (latest lead_time=3 for order P24\u2192arrived P27); prioritize recent average (N=4) until further concludes confirm a new steady state.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_29: on-hand=0, in-transit=513. Historical concluded lead times remain mixed but recent concludes show upward drift; recent 4 concluded lead_times average \u22482.0 so prefer a recent-window estimate for L to capture longer deliveries. Demand history seed (provided samples) used by default forecasting; no clear demand structural break beyond high volatility. Using default mu_hat/sigma_hat lets OR backend apply (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std while we adjust L to reflect recent longer lead times and protect against stockouts given large pipeline uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime mixed with recent upward drift; prioritize recent-window average (N=4) until further concludes confirm new steady state. Large pipeline in-transit = 513 units (monitor for missing/late concludes).

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_30: on-hand=0, in-transit=513, recent realized lead-times are mixed with upward drift (many concludes show 1\u20133 periods; recent window indicates longer tails). Demand history shows large, volatile demands and current pipeline is large but some shipments have been delayed in past \u2014 protect service level by prioritizing recent lead-time evidence and weighting recent demand more. Set L to recent_N (N=4) to reflect recent lead-time drift. Use EWMA_gamma for mu_hat (gamma=0.3) to favor recent high demand while smoothing noise. Use default sigma_hat to let backend scale volatility with chosen L.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime: mixed with recent upward drift; recent concluded lead_times average \u22481.6 with short-term upward trend \u2014 prioritize recent-window average (N=4) until further concludes confirm a new steady state.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Period_31. On-hand=0, in-transit=738. Lead-time history shows mixed/unstable regime with recent upward drift; recent concluded lead_times suggest using a short recent window (N=4) to capture current trend. Demand has shifted materially upward in later periods (many demands ~180\u2013230) vs early-sample low (~100s); to reflect this regime change use a recent window of recent high-demand periods (N=5). Therefore: set L using recent_N (N=4) to prioritize recent lead-time behavior; set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) so the (1+L)*mean reflects recent elevated demand; set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture recent volatility. These choices aim to raise target base-stock to cover the longer recent lead times and higher demand while letting the OR backend cap orders via its cap rule to limit excessive incoming pipeline given large in-transit volume.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_32: on-hand=0, in-transit=491. Historical concluded lead times show a mixed regime with recent upward drift; pipeline large (491) with some overdue/non-concluded earlier orders \u2014 risk of lost shipments but recent concludes recommend prioritizing recent lead-time behavior. Choose L via recent_N (N=4) to prioritize latest lead-time mix and respond to upward drift. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean of all demand samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples; this keeps demand forecast stable while L adapts to recent lead-time variability. This combination raises the ordering horizon for safety given longer recent lead times but avoids overfitting demand volatility. Monitor upcoming concludes for confirmation and adjust if many in-transit units never conclude.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_33. On-hand=39, in-transit=342. Recent conclues show mixed but slightly longer lead times (upward drift); using a recent-window average for L (N=4) captures this short-term trend vs. promised=2. For demand, historical seed is small; use recent_N N=5 to let backend scale (1+L)\xd7mean of the most relevant samples. Volatility use default (backend sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) to avoid overfitting. These choices raise protection against stockouts from recent longer lead-times while letting OR backend compute base-stock and cap balancing profit ($2) vs holding cost ($1). Current pipeline+on-hand (381 total) should be checked against backend target; if arrivals fail to conclude in coming periods treat shipments as lost and re-evaluate L.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:

Set L via recent_N (N=4) to reflect latest concluded lead times. Demand seed is limited to the provided 5-sample history; use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to base forecast on all available demand samples while scaling for (1+L). Use default sigma_hat to let backend compute volatility from all samples. This combination leans on recent lead-time evidence to avoid under-ordering given large in-transit volume and possible delayed shipments, while using full demand sample for a stable demand estimate.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent concluded lead_times show a mixed but upward drift; prioritize recent window average for lead time while accounting for elevated recent demand and high pipeline (in-transit=798). Set L to recent_N (N=4) to capture the short-term upward drift. Demand has trended above the small-sample baseline; use EWMA (gamma=0.3) for mu_hat to weight recent high demands while retaining some prior smoothing. Volatility is elevated\u2014use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent variability. These choices raise target base-stock to protect service during longer/mixed lead times while letting OR cap limit over-ordering given large in-transit stock.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime: mixed with recent upward drift; prioritize recent-window average (N=4) until further concludes confirm a new steady state (evidence: multiple recent concluded lead_times showing 2\u20133 period delays).

LLM Rationale:

This biases orders to cover (1+L) periods under the current longer/mixed lead-time regime and guards against lost/delayed shipments by inflating pipeline coverage.

Choose L as recent_N (N=4) to prioritize latest lead-time behavior. Demand history samples [112,97,116,138,94] show no clear regime shift; use default demand aggregation so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This balances service level (capturing recent longer leads) vs holding cost by increasing protection for recent longer delays while relying on full-sample demand stats to avoid overfitting short noise. Monitor future concludes for regime confirmation.

LLM Rationale:

Demand historical seed samples are limited; use recent_N for mu_hat to let (1+L) scale recent mean. Keep sigma_hat default to reflect full-sample volatility scaled by (1+L). These settings aim to raise target base-stock slightly for the modestly longer recent lead-time while not overstating volatility, balancing service against $1/unit holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime mixed with recent upward drift; prioritize recent-window average (N=4) until further concludes confirm new steady state (evidence: multiple recent concluded lead_times showing 2\u20133 period delays).

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_40: on-hand=2, in-transit=581; recent concluded lead-times show mixed regime with upward drift. Use recent_N for L to prioritize latest behavior (N=4) per prior trend signals. Demand seed dataset is small (5 samples) so keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default (backend will scale by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L) respectively). This balances higher effective lead-time risk (captures recent longer lead-times) while relying on full-sample demand stats to avoid overreacting to transient demand spikes. Large pipeline flagged\u2014parameters account for potential delayed arrivals by increasing L estimate.

Carry-over insight: Large in-transit pipeline = 581 units; monitor for missing/late concludes.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_41: on-hand=0, in-transit=591. Historical concluded lead times show a mixed regime with a recent upward drift toward longer delays; pipeline large (591) increases risk of late/lost shipments. I set L using recent_N (N=4) to prioritize the latest observed lead-time behavior (captures upward drift). I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR engine uses (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples), letting the backend scale demand uncertainty with the chosen lead time. This balances service (by increasing coverage for longer recent lead times) against holding cost given the already-large in-transit pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime: mixed with recent upward drift; prioritize recent-window average (N=4). Large in-transit pipeline=591 units \u2014 monitor for missing/late concludes.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_42: on-hand=0, in-transit=589 \u2014 large pipeline pending. Historical concluded lead times are mixed with recent upward drift; I prioritize a short recent-window estimate for lead time to reflect recent variability while backend uses promised L=2 by default. Demand seed data (provided samples) shows mean ~111.4; with large pipeline I avoid shrinking mu_hat. Choices: L -> recent_N (N=4) to capture recent lead-time drift; mu_hat -> default so backend computes (1+L)*mean of all samples (robust to noisy short-term spikes); sigma_hat -> default to let backend scale volatility with (1+L). This balances service level (use recent lead-time evidence) against holding cost given already-large in-transit inventory.

LLM Rationale:
Lead-time regime remains mixed with recent upward drift; recent concluded lead_times show variability so prioritize recent-window average to capture current drift while avoiding overreacting to single long delays. Choose L via recent_N (N=4) to weight latest evidence. Demand sample set is small (5 samples) and pipeline on-hand is large (589 in-transit), so keep mu_hat and sigma_hat at defaults to let backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples rather than over-adjusting forecast or volatility.

Use L=recent_N (N=4) to prioritize recent concluded lead times. Demand history seed (small sample) will be used by default scaling so mu_hat=default ((1+L)\xd7mean(all samples)) and sigma_hat=default (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples)), letting the OR engine compute safety stock consistent with its profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_45: on-hand=0, in-transit=581. Historical concluded lead_times show mixed/unstable regime with recent upward drift; recent-window average (N=4) best captures current shorter-term trend. Use L=recent_N (N=4) to bias ordering toward the recent lead-time mix while keeping demand estimates conservative by using full-sample defaults for mu and sigma. Large pipeline flagged\u2014monitor for missing/late concludes; defaults for mu_hat/sigma_hat let OR backend use full-sample demand statistics ((1+L)\xd7mean, sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to balance service vs holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime mixed with recent upward drift; prioritize recent-window average (N=4) until further concludes confirm new steady state. Large in-transit pipeline=581 units \u2014 monitor for missing/late concludes.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_46 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=581; lead-time regime has been mixed with recent upward drift so prioritize a short recent-window estimate to capture lengthening delays while avoiding overreaction. Set L via recent_N (N=4) to reflect the most recent concluded lead times. Demand historical seed is the provided 5-sample series which likely understates recent higher demand spikes, so set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to keep the backend anchored to observed demand samples while scaling with chosen L. Keep sigma_hat at default to let backend use full-sample variability scaled by (1+L). These choices balance raising protection against longer/more-variable lead times while avoiding excessive inventory given large existing pipeline.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Lead-time regime remains mixed with recent upward drift; choose recent_N (N=4) to prioritize latest concluded lead-times and hedge longer delays. Large in-transit (662) suggests some shipments outstanding; keeping mu_hat and sigma_hat as default uses full-sample demand stats scaled by (1+L) so OR backend raises target inventory to cover the longer recent lead time while limiting overreaction to transient spikes.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_48: on-hand=0, in-transit=662. Historical concluded lead_times remain mixed with recent upward drift; recent-window (N=4) is the preferred estimator. Demand recently elevated and volatile (many periods with 170\u2013276+), so use recent-window demand estimates to capture current regime. Large in-transit pipeline suggests possible upcoming arrivals but also risk of missing/late concludes; using recent_N for L ensures responsiveness while recent_N for mu_hat/sigma_hat keeps forecast aligned to current high-demand regime and elevated variability.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime: mixed with recent upward drift; prioritize recent-window average (N=4). Evidence: multiple recent concluded lead_times showing 2\u20133 period delays; large in-transit pipeline (662) \u2014 monitor for missing/late concludes.

Historical concluded lead_times are mixed with recent upward drift; prioritize a short recent-window estimate for lead time to capture recent 2\u20133 period delays while backend still uses promised L=2. Chosen L method 'recent_N' with N=4 to focus on the last few concluded lead times (captures recent upward drift). Demand samples are limited in the explicit historical snapshot; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std across all samples given current L estimate, balancing service level vs holding cost without overcommitting inventory given large in-transit pipeline.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_50 decision. On-hand=0, in-transit=581. Historical concluded lead times remain mixed with recent upward drift (recent concludes include a 3-period delay at Period_49). To reflect the recent upward drift while remaining responsive, set lead time estimate using recent_N with N=4 (prioritizes the most recent concluded lead-time samples). Use default demand scaling and default volatility so mu_hat and sigma_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) respectively; this lets the backend compute base-stock with the chosen L while keeping demand estimate anchored to all available samples. This balances higher safety stock for longer/variable lead times against holding cost given large in-transit pipeline and risk of missing/late concludes.
