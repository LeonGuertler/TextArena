Lead time & pipeline: historic concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 periods; In-transit=18,600 units (arrivals distributed from prior orders) but no detailed per-arrival schedule visible. Coverage target: must cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand (current period's demand occurs after decision), so target pipeline+on-hand+order \u22485\xd74,700 = 23,500 units. Current total = 18,600, shortfall \u22484,900 units. Trade-off: profit $4 > holding $1, justify ordering to avoid lost sales. Order decision: place 5,000 units to approximately cover the 5-period demand shortfall while limiting excess holding cost given only one period remaining after Period 49.",

  "rationale": "World/demand: Recent periods (P46\u2013P49) demand = [4530,4595,4776,5087] -> expect ~4.8k units this period. Lead time & pipeline: Confirmed actual LT=4. In-transit=18600 equals orders placed P46\u2013P49 (4200+0+9400+5000). Only the P46 order (4200) will arrive during Period 50; P47\u2013P49 arrive later. On-hand=0 now, so available to sell this period = arrival from P46 = 4200, short of expected demand (~4800), causing some lost sales. Ordering in Period 50 would arrive at earliest in Period 54 (order+4) and thus cannot help sales in this final/horizon period; it would only create ending inventory incurring holding cost. Therefore place no new order.",
