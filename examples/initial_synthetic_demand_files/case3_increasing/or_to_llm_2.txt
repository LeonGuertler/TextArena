{
  "rationale": "Context & timing: Promised lead time L=4. When deciding in Period 5 we see Period 4 conclude (arrived=0) but cannot conclude any shipments are lost yet because orders placed in earlier periods may still be in transit and will only show up in conclude messages after their physical arrival.

Using the same demand stats and critical fractile (profit $4, holding $1 \u2192 q=0.8 \u2192 z\u22480.842) gives: expected (L+1)-period demand \u03bc\u0302=5\xd7111.4=557; \u03c3\u0302\u2248\u221a5\xd717.6\u224839.4.

Order needed to reach base-stock \u2248 590 \u2212 499 = 91 units. Rationale for deviating from OR (377\u219291): OR's cap/other internals produced a larger recommendation; however, given substantial pipeline (499) we only need a modest replenishment to hit the target base-stock for (L+1) periods. I do not increase order to cover potential lost shipments because conclude messages through Period 4 do not yet prove shipments are lost (insufficient evidence per lead-time rules).
