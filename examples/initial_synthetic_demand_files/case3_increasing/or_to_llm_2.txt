{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: concluded history shows arrivals same-period for all past orders (Period 1\u201349), so actual lead time = 0. Inventory/pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=0, so no coverage for current period demand. Demand analysis: recent realized single-period demands (Periods 41\u201349) average \u22484,470 units (values: 4166,4040,3950,4444,4364,4530,4595,4776,5087) \u2014 materially above the OR baseline. OR recommended 3,566 units (uses older historical stats and promised lead time); with profit $4 vs holding $1 the critical fractile favors stocking more. Strategy: because lead time = 0, orders arrive in same period and we should target a single-period target near recent demand mean to avoid lost sales. I increase OR's recommendation to 4,500 units to better match recent realized demand while limiting excess holding. Final action: order 4,500 units.",
