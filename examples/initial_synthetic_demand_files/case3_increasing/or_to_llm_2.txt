Decision: follow OR's recommended capped order (141 units). Reasoning: with zero on-hand/in-transit and a long promised lead time, we need pipeline to cover future demand; the OR cap is a conservative, statistically justified quantity that prevents extreme over-ordering given limited sample variance. I will not increase the order because (a) no evidence yet of higher demand or shorter lead time and (b) larger orders raise holding cost $1/unit/period; nor reduce it because starting inventory is zero and understocking would cause lost sales given L\u22654.

Rationale: current pipeline (141) plus OR order (138) brings committed inventory toward the OR-designed replenishment rate while respecting the cap that limits over-ordering given uncertainty in actual lead time and holding cost ($1/unit/period). Demand in Period 1 (91) was below mean but not sufficient evidence of a sustained drop; no concluded arrivals exist to justify larger deviation.
