Inventory economics: profit per unit $2 vs holding $1/period \u2014 avoid unnecessary holding. Strategy: do not order additional units now (order=0) because pipeline already approximates the (L+1)-period expected demand; wait one more period to observe whether in-transit shipments conclude (to detect lost shipments or actual lead time) before placing replenishment.
