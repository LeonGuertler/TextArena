Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. No arrivals or conclude messages yet (on-hand=0, in-transit=0). Historical demand samples for chips(Regular): [112,97,116,138,94] (mean=111.4, std\u224815.9). Promised lead time=2 and no concluded lead-time observations to contradict it, so use default lead time. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full history; this balances service level vs holding cost with no evidence of regime change or lost shipments.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_2: on-hand=0, in-transit=141 (order placed Period_1). No concluded arrivals yet; historical demand samples = [112,97,116,138,94] (mean=111.4). Promised lead time=2 and no evidence to change it yet (only one conclude showing no arrival expected until Period_3). Use default lead time to let backend assume promise=2. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat to default (use full-sample mean/variance scaled by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L)) so OR engine computes base-stock from overall historical demand while accounting for the 3-period review+lead horizon. This balances service level against holding cost given moderate demand and existing in-transit inventory of 141.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=279 (141+138), no concluded arrivals yet \u2192 cannot infer actual lead time. Use promised lead time to avoid overcorrecting for likely in-transit arrivals. Demand history (5 samples mean=111.4, std\u224815.7) shows no clear recent changepoint. Set L to default (promised=2). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample set, balancing service level vs holding cost while accounting for 3-period coverage (current+L). This keeps orders restrained given large pipeline and avoids aggressive replacement that could raise holding costs if in-transit arrives as expected.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_4 start. Observed demands rising (91, 246, 285 \u2192 recent surge). All three concluded messages show ordered units still arriving=0 though in-transit=424 (141+138+145), implying promised L=2 failed\u2014shipments overdue. To protect against stockouts I set L explicit=3 to reflect longer effective lead time. For demand I use recent_N on last 3 samples to capture the current elevated demand regime. Sigma uses recent_N over last 3 samples to reflect recent volatility. These settings raise the (1+L)-period forecast and safety buffer to balance service level vs holding cost given overdue shipments.

Carry-over insight: Lead time appears lengthened: orders from Periods 1-3 (141,138,145) remain in-transit with no arrivals in concludes; treat as new longer-lead regime (use L\u22483) until arrivals confirm otherwise.

Daily Reward (R_t): $848.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_5 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=377. Recent concludes reveal variable but shorter actual lead times: orders from P1\u2013P3 concluded in P4 with lead_times [3,2,1] (avg=2). Demand has jumped in recent periods (history shows large recent demands culminating in 437 in P4). To capture the recent higher demand regime while letting the OR backend infer average lead time from observations, set L to be calculated from observed lead times, and use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to emphasize the most recent demand spike. This balances higher target base-stock to meet elevated demand while letting backend cap orders per its cap formula. 

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime updated: observed lead_times [3,2,1] (orders from P1\u2013P3) \u2192 average observed L=2; treat lead time as variable but centered ~2 until further evidence.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_6: recent demand has surged (Period1-5 demands: 91,246,285,437,448). On-hand=0, in-transit=866 (covers several past large orders, some with delayed arrivals). Observed concluded lead_times = [3,2,1] \u2192 average 2. To capture the current high-demand regime I set L to the observed average (calculate) and use recent_N=5 for demand mean/volatility so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the large, recent sample rather than older low-demand data. This balances service (higher target stock) against holding cost given strong recent demand and significant in-transit inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $895.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_7: recent demand has jumped sharply since Period_4 (demands P4\u2013P6 = 437, 448, 587) indicating a new high-demand regime. Observed concluded lead_times = [3,2,1,2,1] (from Periods 4 and 6 concludes) \u2192 average \u22481.8, centered near 2. On-hand (279) + in-transit (468) = 747, which is well below (1+L)\xd7recent mean demand if L\u22482, so parameters should reflect the new higher-demand regime and the empirically observed ~2-period lead time. Choices: L use 'calculate' to let backend average observed lead times (captures variability around 2); mu_hat use 'recent_N' with N=3 to base (1+L)\xd7mean on the most recent high-demand samples (P4\u2013P6) and react to regime shift; sigma_hat use 'recent_N' with N=3 to reflect recent demand volatility. These settings prioritize service (higher base_stock) to avoid stockouts during the elevated-demand regime while keeping volatility estimate tied to recent data.

Carry-over insight: Updated lead-time regime: observed lead_times [3,2,1,2,1], average \u22481.8 \u2192 treat L\u22482 until further evidence; Demand regime change: sustained demand increase starting Period_4 (P4\u2013P6 mean \u2248490.7) \u2014 use recent 3-period mean for forecasts.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_8: on-hand=0, in-transit=1097. Recent concluded lead_times = [3,2,1,2,1] (avg\u22481.8) and demand has risen since Period_4; most recent demands (P5\u2013P7 = 448,587,637) show a higher regime. Reconcile: large in-transit stock (1097) likely covers multiple periods but variability and variable lead time risk stockouts if pipeline shorter than realized L. Chosen L: recent_N N=5 to capture the recent observed lead-time series (avg \u22481.8 ~2). Chosen mu_hat: recent_N N=3 to base (1+L)-period demand forecast on the most recent demand regime (P5\u2013P7 mean \u2248557.33), which prevents underordering given the upward shift. Chosen sigma_hat: recent_N N=3 to reflect recent demand volatility. These settings bias the OR backend toward higher base-stock (higher service) while using recent volatility to moderate safety stock given holding cost.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_9: on-hand=0, in-transit=1816. Historical concludes show observed lead_times = [3,2,1,2,1] (avg \u22481.8) indicating a variable but ~2-period lead-time regime and earlier lost/late arrivals\u2014use recent observed lead times to capture current variability. Demand jumped starting Period_4; recent demand (Periods 6\u20138 = 587, 637, 776) reflects the new higher regime, so use a 3-period recent mean for mu_hat and sigma_hat to forecast (covers review+lead demand). These settings (L recent_N=5, mu_hat recent_N=3, sigma_hat recent_N=3) let the OR backend compute base_stock tuned to the higher recent demand while using observed lead-time variability to avoid underordering despite in-transit uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime: observed lead_times [3,2,1,2,1], average \u22481.8 \u2192 treat L\u22482 (variable) until further evidence; Demand regime change: sustained higher demand starting Period_4; use recent 3-period mean for forecasts (Periods 6\u20138 mean \u2248666.7).

Recent demand has stepped up; last 3 observed demands (Periods 7\u20139) = [637,776,963], so use recent 3-period mean to capture the new high-demand regime. Use 'calculate' for L to reflect observed average lead time; use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)\xd7recent mean and volatility, which balances higher service level against holding cost given large in-transit and variable lead time.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_11: on-hand=0, in-transit=2985. Concluded arrivals show observed lead_times [3,2,1,2,1] (avg\u22481.8) and sustained demand increase beginning Period_4 with recent high demands (Periods 8\u201310 = 776,963,863). Use calculate for L to reflect observed average lead time from concluded history. Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base forecast and volatility on the most recent high-demand regime (captures current spike and variability). This combination ensures the OR backend targets (1+L)-period demand under the recent high-demand regime while acknowledging the longer/variable lead-time evidenced by concluded arrivals; large in-transit balances immediate shortage risk.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime centered ~2 (observed lead_times [3,2,1,2,1], avg\u22481.8) \u2014 treat L\u22482 until further evidence; Demand regime increased starting Period_4, use recent 3-period mean/volatility (Periods 8\u201310 mean \u2248867.3) for forecasts.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12: demand has materially increased since Period 4 and recent 3-period means used by prior insight show elevated demand; observed concluded lead_times through Period 11 average \u22481.8 so I treat lead time as 2 this period to be conservative. On-hand=0 and in-transit=2656 (large pipeline) \u2014 use L=2 to size the (1+L) review+lead forecast; use recent 3-period demand to capture the new high-demand regime and recent volatility for safety. Methods chosen: L explicit=2 (captures observed ~1.8 and simplifies pipeline sizing); mu_hat recent_N N=3 to forecast (1+L)-period demand from the newest high-demand regime; sigma_hat recent_N N=3 to reflect recent volatility and let the OR engine compute safety stock. This balances service (high recent demand) against holding cost given already-large in-transit inventory and uncertain/variable lead times.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_13: on-hand=0, in-transit=2226. Historical concluded lead_times = [3,2,1,2,1,2,2,1] (avg=1.75) \u2192 lead time variable but centered ~2. Demand has been in a higher regime since Period_4; recent 3-period demands (Periods 10\u201312 = 863,1136,1221) show a strong upward shift (mean\u22481073). To keep service while avoiding excess holding given profit=$2 and holding=$1, set L to be calculated from observed lead times (lets backend use avg observed), and use recent 3-period mean/volatility for mu_hat and sigma_hat so forecasts reflect the new higher-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Lead time regime: observed lead_times [3,2,1,2,1,2,2,1], average\u22481.75 \u2192 treat L\u22482 (variable) until further evidence; Demand regime increased starting Period_4 \u2014 use recent 3-period mean/volatility for forecasts (Periods 10\u201312 mean\u22481073).

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_14: on-hand=0, in-transit=3607. Historical concluded lead_times = [3,2,1,2,1,2,2,1] (avg\u22481.75) \u2014 recent pattern centers around 2 periods. Recent demand (Periods 11\u201313) = [1136,1221,1246], mean\u22481201 indicating a sustained higher-demand regime started ~Period_4. Given substantial in-transit stock but variable lead times, set L to the averaged observed lead time to reflect the longer-but-variable pipeline. Use a recent-3 approach for demand and volatility so mu_hat/sigma_hat adapt to the elevated current demand (backend will scale by (1+L)). This balances service (capturing recent high demand) against holding cost given large in-transit inventory and lead-time variability. Flag: large in-transit (3607) likely covers multiple periods of demand; monitor for missing/concluded arrivals to detect lost shipments.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period_15: observed lead_times recent history = [3,2,1,2,1,2,2,1] (avg\u22481.75) \u2014 treat as variable but centered ~2. On-hand=526, in-transit=2381 (pipeline large); recent demand has stayed high (Periods 12\u201314 demands = 1221,1246,1265; 3-period mean \u22481244). Choose L recent_N to reflect recent observed lead-time regime (N=8). Use mu_hat recent_N with N=3 to capture the elevated demand regime (use last 3 periods). Use sigma_hat recent_N N=3 to reflect recent volatility. These settings keep forecast tied to the confirmed higher demand while accounting for the ~2-period lead-time, helping the OR backend size orders to meet service targets without unnecessarily inflating holding costs.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_16: on-hand=0, in-transit=2814. Historical concluded lead_times cluster around 2 (observed sequence includes 3,2,1,2,1,2,2,1,1) \u2014 treat current lead-time regime as L\u22482 to be conservative. Demand has been in a higher regime since Period_4; most recent 3-period demands (P13\u2013P15 = 1246,1265,1507) show a sustained elevated mean. I set L explicit=2 to reflect the observed ~2-period center and persistent variability; use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so forecasts and safety stock respond to the most recent high-demand regime. This balances service (avoid stockouts given large in-transit) versus holding cost by sizing to recent high demand while acknowledging substantial pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime centered ~2 (observed lead_times avg\u22481.75\u20131.8 across concludes); treat L\u22482 until contradicted. Demand regime increased starting Period_4; use recent 3-period statistics for forecasting.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:

Historical concludes show variable but centered lead times \u22481.75\u20131.8\u2014treat as L\u22482. To capture the recent elevated demand and maintain service given variable lead time, set L explicitly to 2 and forecast using the recent 3-period mean/volatility (N=3). This keeps base_stock responsive to the new higher-demand regime while the large in-transit pipeline restrains immediate extra ordering via the OR cap.

Carry-over insight: Lead time regime centered ~2 (observed lead_times average \u22481.75\u20131.8 across concludes); Demand regime increased starting Period_4; use recent 3-period statistics for forecasting.

On-hand=0, in-transit=4460 (sufficient pipeline to cover multiple periods). I choose L="calculate" so backend uses observed conclude lead-times (captures variable ~2). For demand I use recent_N N=3 (Periods 17\u201319 demands [1724,1802,2075]) to capture the elevated regime and respond quickly to continuing growth. For volatility I use recent_N N=3 to reflect recent demand dispersion. These choices keep target base-stock responsive to the new, higher-demand regime while relying on pipeline inventory to avoid over-ordering if some shipments are delayed or lost.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_21: recent demand has been very high and rising; last 3 period demands (P18\u2013P20) avg \u22481950 per period. Multiple concluded messages show variable but centered lead_times \u22482 (observed W values: 3,2,1,2,1,2,2,1 \u2192 avg\u22481.75\u20131.8). Current inventory: on-hand=365, in-transit=3810 \u2192 pipeline+on-hand (~4175) is below (1+L)*recent_mean if L=2 (\u22485850), so we remain supply-constrained vs. recent demand. Choose L explicit=2 to reflect the stable ~2-period regime from concludes. Use mu_hat recent_N N=3 to anchor forecasts to the elevated recent demand regime (captures last 3-period surge). Use sigma_hat recent_N N=3 to capture recent volatility. These settings bias the OR backend toward higher base-stock to improve service during the new high-demand regime while keeping sigma based on recent variability; explicit L handles prior missing/variable arrivals by fixing lead-time at the concluded ~2 estimate.

Lead-time observations across concludes center near 2 periods (avg \u22481.75\u20131.8) \u2014 treat L=2 this period. To match the recent high-demand regime use a 3-period recent forecast for (1+L)-period demand (captures most recent trend while keeping N small). Sigma estimated from the same 3 most recent demand samples to reflect current volatility.

Period_25: on-hand=0, in-transit=4884. Historical concluded lead_times average \u22481.75\u20131.8; treat lead time as 2 this period to reflect variable but centered ~2. Demand has been in a higher regime since Period_4; use recent 3-period statistics to capture the upward trend and reduce lag. Choices: L explicit=2 to enforce the observed ~2-period regime; mu_hat recent_N N=3 to forecast (1+L)\xd7mean of last 3 demands; sigma_hat recent_N N=3 to capture recent volatility. This balances service (short lead-time center, recent-demand focus) vs holding cost given large in-transit stock.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_26: on-hand=0, in-transit=6380. Historical concludes show variable but center lead_time\u22482 (recent concludes average ~1.75\u20131.8); sustained higher demand since Period_4. I set L by averaging observed lead times to capture variable regime; I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent 3-period statistics to reflect the elevated demand trend (use most recent demand samples to adapt quickly). This ensures orders (with existing large pipeline) are sized to meet the current high-demand regime while acknowledging variable lead times.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime centered ~2 (observed concludes avg\u22481.75\u20131.8) \u2014 treat L\u22482 until contradicted; Demand regime increased starting Period_4 \u2014 use recent 3-period statistics for forecasts.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_27: recent demand has been in a higher regime since Period_4; last three demands (Periods 24\u201326 = 2566, 2604, 2645) average \u22482605. Concluded lead times across history average \u22481.75\u20131.8; treat L as 2 (explicit) until contradicted. Given L=2, use recent 3-period demand stats for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained elevated demand and recent volatility. On-hand (1613) + in-transit (3832) currently provide a large pipeline buffer (~5445) vs. forecast (1+L periods) but we still set demand-driven parameters so OR backend balances service level vs holding cost.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_28: on-hand=0, in-transit=6232. Historical concludes show variable but center ~2-period lead time (recent concludes average \u22481.75\u20131.8); continue treating L\u22482. Demand has been in a higher regime since Period_4; recent three-period demand (Periods 25\u201327 = 2604, 2645, 2890; mean \u22482713) best reflects current demand level. To capture current regime I use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine sizes base stock for the higher, recent demand while keeping L at the promised/default value of 2 to align with observed average lead time and avoid overreacting to occasional 3-period arrivals. This balances service (meet high recent demand) vs holding cost given large in-transit pipeline.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 with zero on-hand and large in-transit (8255). Historical concluded lead-times average ~1.75\u20131.8 and prior carry-over insights treat L\u22482; recent demand regime is higher and best captured by the last 3 periods. I set L explicitly to 2 to reflect the established ~2-period lead-time regime (protecting against variable arrivals). I use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine forecasts using the most recent elevated demand mean/volatility (matches the documented policy to use recent 3-period stats). This keeps base_stock responsive to the higher demand while the large in-transit pipeline reduces immediate stockout risk; the tighter recent_N volatility prevents excessive over-ordering given holding cost=$1/unit.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4709.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 snapshot. Recent concludes show actual lead_times averaging ~1.75\u20131.8 (variable but centered near 2), so set L=2. On-hand=919 + in-transit=4551 => pipeline total=5470, but recent 3-period demand (Periods 27\u201329 = 2890,2643,2814) mean = 2782.3; (1+L)=3 \u2192 3-period demand \u2248 8347, so inventory+pipeline \u22485470 < required \u22488347 indicating we should order more. Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the elevated demand regime that began around Period_4 and to reflect current volatility. These parameters bias the OR engine toward higher base-stock while L=2 accounts for observed lead-time variability.

Use a lead-time estimate centered at 2 periods (consistent with observed concludes avg \u22481.75\u20131.8). On-hand=0, in-transit=8095 (~2698 per period over (1+L)=3), so pipeline nearly covers expected demand but not by a large margin; choose recent-3 demand stats to keep forecasts responsive to the elevated regime.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_36: demand has been in a sustained higher regime since Period_4; recent realized demands (Periods 33\u201335 = 3391,3368,3282) average ~3347. Lead times observed in concluded history cluster around 1\u20133 with mean \u22481.8; treat lead time as L=2 this period. Large pipeline (in-transit=9463) means we should forecast using the recent 3-period demand to capture current elevated demand while capping orders via the OR engine. Chosen: L explicit=2 to reflect observed ~2-period regime; mu_hat recent_N=3 to use latest demand mean across the review+lead window; sigma_hat recent_N=3 to capture recent volatility. These settings raise the base-stock to meet the high recent demand while relying on the OR cap to limit excessive ordering given high pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_37: demand has been in a sustained high regime since Period_4; recent volatility also elevated. Concluded lead-times historically cluster around 2 (avg \u22481.75\u20131.8). Use observed lead-time average (calculate) to let backend center L\u22482 while still adapting. For demand forecast and volatility use recent 3-period statistics to capture the current high-demand regime and recent variance; this aligns orders+pipeline to cover (1+L) periods of elevated demand and limits excess holding given high holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime centered ~2 (observed concludes avg \u22481.75\u20131.8) \u2014 treat L\u22482 until contradicted; Demand regime increased starting Period_4 \u2014 use recent 3-period statistics for forecasts.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_38: recent concludes show lead-time regime centered ~2 (multiple conclude lead_times average \u22481.75\u20131.8). On-hand=0, in-transit=9580 \u2192 substantial pipeline covering multiple periods. Recent demand has been elevated since Period_4; last 3 concluded demands (Periods 35\u201337) = [3282,3448,3748], indicating a high recent mean. To balance service level given variable but ~2-period lead time and high demand, set L explicitly to 2, forecast mu_hat using the recent 3-period mean (captures current regime), and use recent 3-period volatility for sigma_hat so OR backend sizes safety stock to current variability while capping orders by its cap rule.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime centered ~2 (observed concludes average \u22481.75\u20131.8) \u2014 treat L\u22482 until contradicted; Demand regime increased starting Period_4 \u2014 use recent 3-period statistics for forecasts.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 39. Concluded history shows a persistent higher-demand regime since Period_4 and observed lead-times cluster around 2 periods (multiple concludes average \u22481.75\u20131.8). Current inventory: on-hand=1129, in-transit=5597 (large pipeline). To reflect observed lead-time regime use calculated average of observed lead times. For demand forecast and volatility use the most recent 3-period statistics to capture the elevated demand regime while keeping responsiveness to recent swings. These settings keep base-stock aligned with current higher demand and observed lead-time variability, avoiding overreaction given substantial pipeline.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_40: demand has been in a sustained high regime since Period_4; on-hand=0, in-transit=9705 which should cover multiple upcoming periods. Historical concluded lead-times center ~2 periods. I set L to the promised/default (2) consistent with observed avg\u22481.75\u20131.8 and prior carry-over insight. For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=3) to capture the current elevated regime (focus on the last 3 observed demands) and for volatility also use recent_N (N=3) so the OR backend sizes base-stock to current high mean and measured short-run variability. This balances service (high profit relative to holding cost) against holding by using short-window estimates reflecting the recent upshift.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:

Historical concluded lead-times center ~2 periods; use promised/default L=2. Use recent 3-period demand statistics for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained higher-demand regime and recent volatility. This balances service (higher \u03bc\u0302 to avoid stockouts) against holding cost given large in-transit inventory.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 42: demand has been in a higher regime since Period_4 with large recent demands; on-hand=0, in-transit=12801 (large pipeline). Concluded lead-time history averages ~1.75\u20131.8 (center \u22482). I use L=default to keep promised lead time=2 (consistent with concluded avg and prior carry-over), mu_hat recent_N N=3 to target the most recent elevated demand (captures immediate regime), and sigma_hat recent_N N=3 to reflect recent volatility. This keeps base-stock responsive to the higher recent demand while the large in-transit pipeline reduces immediate understock risk; using recent 3-period stats balances service level vs holding cost given high profit/holding ratio.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_43: on-hand=2427, in-transit=6491, profit=2, holding=1. Historical concludes show variable but centered lead_time\u22482 (many observed W in {1,2,3}, recent average ~1.75\u20131.8). Demand has been in an elevated regime since Period_4; recent 3-periods best capture current high mean/volatility. Choose L explicit=2 to reflect operationally stable center ~2 despite variability; mu_hat recent_N N=3 to forecast (1+L)\xd7recent mean and react quickly to the high-demand regime; sigma_hat recent_N N=3 to capture recent volatility for safety stock. These parameters hedge service-level (higher \u03bc\u0302) while avoiding excessive long-term holding given significant pipeline already in-transit and holding cost.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44: on-hand=0, in-transit=10402. Historical concludes show a stable longer-lead regime centered ~2 periods and a sustained demand increase beginning Period_4; recent 3-period demand best captures current elevated demand. To balance service vs holding cost (profit=$2, holding=$1), set lead time to 2 to cover transit; use recent 3-period mean/volatility for mu_hat and sigma_hat so OR backend targets (L+1)-period demand under current high-demand regime and avoids excessive overstock given large pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime centered ~2 (observed concludes avg \u22481.75\u20131.8); Demand regime increased starting Period_4 \u2014 use recent 3-period statistics for forecasts.

LLM Rationale:
Period_45: on-hand=0, in-transit=11500. Historical concludes show a stable longer lead-time regime centered \u22482 periods; recent demand regime has been elevated since Period_4. In-transit is large (covers multiple periods) but arrivals are observed with lag; treat L=2 to match observed concludes. Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the elevated, rapidly changing demand (prioritize last 3-period mean/volatility). This keeps base-stock responsive to the high recent demand while acknowledging variable lead times and large pipeline.

Historical concludes show a persistent lead-time regime centered ~2 (observed concludes avg \u22481.75\u20131.8) and a sustained demand increase beginning Period_4; recent demand is high. I set L explicitly to 2 to reflect the observed regime and to align with past concludes. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=3 to capture the current high-demand regime (use the last three concluded demands) so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)\xd7recent mean and volatility. This balances service (higher target stock for elevated demand and variable lead times) against holding cost given large in-transit inventory; using recent 3-period stats responds quickly if demand continues to change. No new evidence of lost shipments beyond the known variable L\u22482 regime.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 49 decision. On-hand=0, in-transit=15051 which already covers multiple future periods; historical concludes show actual lead-times centered ~2 (avg \u22481.75\u20131.8). Demand regime has been elevated since Period_4; recent 3-period statistics best capture current demand spike. Set L using observed lead-times average (let backend compute from concludes). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to reflect the elevated recent mean and volatility; this keeps base-stock responsive while the large in-transit pipeline prevents immediate stockouts.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_50: on-hand=881, in-transit=9560; historical concludes show variable but centered lead_time \u22482 (recent observed sequence length 8: [3,2,1,2,1,2,2,1]). Demand regime elevated since Period_4; recent 3-period demand is the best indicator for near-term forecast. To be robust to variable lead-times and recent demand spike, set L by averaging the last 8 observed lead-times (recent_N N=8), and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3 demand samples (recent_N N=3) so the OR backend targets base stock aligned with current high-demand regime while accounting for observed lead-time variability and overdue shipments.
