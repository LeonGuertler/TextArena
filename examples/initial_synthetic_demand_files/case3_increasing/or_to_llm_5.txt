Cost tradeoff: profit $4/unit vs holding $1/unit \u2192 critical fractile favors filling demand (lost sales are costly relative to holding). Strategy: order to cover expected current-period demand with a small buffer. I set order = 4,400 units (\u2248 recent 7-period average rounded up), which should maximize sold units this period while keeping modest ending inventory exposure. This overrides OR's lower recommendation because OR uses outdated historical mean and promised lead time only; actual observed demand regime is sustained and lead time is 0 so immediate fulfillment is possible.",

======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: concluded history (Periods 1\u201349) consistently shows orders arriving same period \u2192 actual lead time = 0. Inventory & demand: on-hand=0, in-transit=0 so all demand must be met with a same-period order. Recent demand regime is sustained high (carry-over insight notes mean jump since Period 2; recent demands: P45\u2013P49 = 4364, 4420, 4300, 4500, 4400 arrivals with demands P45\u2013P49 = 4364, 4530, 4595, 4776, 5087), latest demand = 5087 and several periods ~4.3k\u20134.8k. OR recommended 3566 (based on historical low-sample mean) which would significantly understock and forgo profitable sales (profit $4 > holding $1 so service is prioritized). Decision: with L=0 the order arrives in time to meet Period 50 demand; ordering excess only incurs $1 holding per unit for next period, while missed sales lose $4 profit per unit. I therefore increase above OR to target expected current-period demand while avoiding large overstock. Action chosen = 5000 units, which is close to the most recent demand (5087) and near the recent multi-period range (4.3k\u20135.1k). This balances avoiding lost sales against holding cost given high realized demand regime. Follow-up: monitor Period 50 conclude to confirm demand and update carry-over only if a sustained change (3+ periods) appears.",
