{

Recent demand (Periods 40\u201349) averages ~4,441 units/period, so (L+1)=3 periods demand \u2248 13,323 units. Pipeline (9200) leaves a shortfall \u2248 4,123 units to cover the next 3 periods. OR recommended 0 (uses promised L and historical data) but that would understock given the confirmed high-demand regime and confirmed L=2. I order 4,200 units (rounded slightly above the shortfall) to bring available+in-transit closer to a 3-period coverage while avoiding excess holding cost. This balances missed-sales risk (profit $4) against holding cost $1, given strong recent demand and confirmed 2-period lead time.",
