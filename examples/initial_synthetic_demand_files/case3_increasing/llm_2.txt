Holding cost = $1/unit/period vs profit $4/unit; placing additional order increases holding cost risk given ample pipeline and lead-time variability. e) Order logic: place zero to avoid unnecessary holding cost while monitoring arrivals in conclude messages and reassess if arrivals are delayed or pipeline is lost.",
