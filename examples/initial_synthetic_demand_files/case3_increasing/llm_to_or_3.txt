Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start: no on-hand or in-transit inventory; historical demand samples for chips(Regular) = [112,97,116,138,94] (mean=111.4, sd\u224816.0). No calendar/news signals. Promised lead time = 4 periods; no concluded arrivals to suggest a different lead time. Use default L to respect promise and because no observed lead-time data exists. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample, providing a balanced base-stock that covers current plus L future periods while reflecting observed demand variability and the profit/holding cost tradeoff.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period start: no on-hand inventory, 141 units in-transit from Period 1 order which has not concluded (arrived=0 in Period 1 conclude). No concluded arrivals exist to infer actual lead time; use promised lead time. Historical demand samples = [112,97,116,138,94]; no clear recent changepoint. Use default demand/volatility aggregation so backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std with L=promised.

Carry-over insight: Possible delayed/lost shipment: order of 141 units placed in Period 1 has not yet arrived by Period 1 conclude (monitor if it remains unconcluded past promised lead time).

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=279 (orders 141 from P1 and 138 from P2 remain unconcluded). Promised lead time = 4; no concluded arrivals yet so cannot infer actual lead time\u2014use default L to let OR assume promised lead time. Demand history mean ~111.4 and variance from samples available; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using full sample set. This addresses the short pipeline (279 vs. target ~5\xd7mean\u2248557) by letting OR produce orders to rebuild the pipeline while balancing profit vs holding cost under the standard baseline.

Carry-over insight: P1 order 141 and P2 order 138 remain unconcluded by Period_3 conclude; likely delayed or lost shipment\u2014monitor if still unconcluded past promised lead time.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4: on-hand=0, in-transit=497 (orders P1=141, P2=138, P3=218) and no arrivals have been concluded yet but none are past the promised 4-period lead time, so no confirmed lead-time regime change. Historical demand samples [112,97,116,138,94] show mean\u2248111.4; use default calculations so OR backend uses (1+L)\xd7historical mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std to set base stock and volatility. This is conservative: respects promised L, leverages full-sample demand stats, and balances service level (profit>holding) against holding cost.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
On-hand=0, in-transit=769 (sum of Periods1-4 orders). No concluded arrivals yet; shipments placed in P1-P4 remain unconcluded past their expected windows, indicating delayed/lost shipments risk. Demand history shows rising demand (samples: [112,97,116,138,94] mean=111.4) and recent realized store demand in concludes rising sharply (91\u2192246\u2192285\u2192437), so I increase lead-time estimate modestly to be conservative and ensure pipeline covers upcoming high demand. Choose L explicit=5 (one period longer than promised) to buffer against observed delays; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, which scales safety stock with the longer lead time and the empirical demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Delayed/lost shipments: orders from Periods 1\u20134 (141,138,218,272) remain unconcluded by Period 4 conclude; treat as prolonged delays/loss risk until arrivals are confirmed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $282.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Observed lead time confirmed at 4 periods (Period_5 conclude: P1 arrival, lead_time=4). Recent realized demand has jumped sharply vs historical samples: recent demands (Periods1-5) = [91,246,285,437,448], mean=301.4 \u2192 substantial upward shift from prior sample mean (~111). On-hand=0, in-transit=1005 which is below (1+L)*recent mean (~1507), so parameters should reflect the new high demand and higher variance to avoid stockouts. Set L=default to trust promised lead time (4). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new demand regime and elevated variability.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand regime shift upward: recent Periods1-5 mean=301.4 vs historical mean\u2248111; treat as new demand level until contradicted. Lead time confirmed at 4 periods (Period_5 conclude: P1 arrival, lead_time=4).

Daily Reward (R_t): $276.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Demand has shifted sharply higher over Periods 1\u20136 (recent mean \u2248301.4 over last 5 periods) and lead time has been confirmed at 4 periods by concluded arrivals (P1 and P2 showed lead_time=4). On-hand is 0 with 1412 in-transit. To reflect the new sustained higher demand regime, set L to promised/default (confirmed=4) and use recent_N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to weight the last 5 high-demand observations. This increases the base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of the new demand level while sigma from recent data raises safety stock to protect service level given higher volatility.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand regime shift upward: recent Periods1-5 mean=301.4 vs historical mean\u2248111; treat as new demand level until contradicted; Lead time confirmed at 4 periods (Period_5 conclude: P1 arrival, lead_time=4).

Daily Reward (R_t): $436.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Context: Period_8. Lead time confirmed = 4 periods from concluded arrivals (P1\u2013P3 concluded with lead_time=4). Recent demand has shifted sharply upward (recent demands: 285,437,448,587,637; mean=478.8). On-hand=0, in-transit=1821 which is below the (1+L)-period demand implied by recent mean (5\xd7478.8=2394), so pipeline likely insufficient. Decisions: keep L as default (use promised lead time = 4, consistent with confirmed observations). Set mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture the new high-demand regime ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 samples). Set sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to reflect increased demand volatility from recent observations. These choices bias orders toward meeting the new higher demand while the OR backend balances service level vs holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $544.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 9. On-hand=0, in-transit=2256. Recent demand has materially increased vs historical low-signal sample: recent demands (Periods 4\u20138)=[437,448,587,637,776], recent 5-mean \u2248577. Lead time has been repeatedly observed as 4 periods (arrivals for P1\u2013P4 confirmed lead_time=4). In-transit (2256) covers ~3.9 periods at recent demand rate (~577) but falls short of (L+1)=5 periods coverage\u2014risk of stockouts if demand persists. Therefore: set L by calculating average observed lead times to lock in confirmed L=4; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to reflect the new high-demand regime and updated volatility. This raises the base-stock to prioritize service given high lost-sales cost (profit>holding) while sigma_hat recent_N captures increased variability.

Carry-over insight: Sustained upward demand regime: recent 5-period mean\u2248577 (Periods 4\u20138); treat as new demand level until contradicted; Lead time confirmed at 4 periods (Period_5\u20138 conclude: P1\u2013P4 arrivals, lead_time=4).

Daily Reward (R_t): $754.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 10. On-hand=0, in-transit=2644. Recent demand shows a sustained high regime (periods 5\u20139 large spikes) and lead time consistently observed = 4. Set L explicitly to 4. For demand forecast use recent_N (N=5) to capture the new high-demand regime (periods 5\u20139 mean \u2248682.2); apply same recent_N (N=5) for sigma to reflect recent volatility. This keeps base-stock responsive to the elevated demand while capping orders via the backend cap to limit overstock risk.

Carry-over insight: Sustained upward demand regime: recent 5-period mean\u2248682.2 (Periods 5\u20139); Lead time confirmed = 4 periods (observed P1\u2013P4 arrivals, lead_time=4).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1090.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent concluded history shows a sustained, substantial upward demand regime and lead time stable at 4 periods (P1\u2013P4 arrivals observed with lead_time=4). On-hand=0 but large in-transit=3055; given high recent demand (Periods 6\u201310) I target the recent-5 demand regime to size review+lead demand and volatility. Set L to promised/default (4) since concluded arrivals confirm 4. Use mu_hat recent_N (N=5) to base (1+L)\xd7mean on the latest high-demand regime (Periods 6\u201310 mean=765.2), and sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to capture recent volatility. This balances higher service level needed for the new demand level while avoiding overstatement from older low-demand samples.

Carry-over insight: Sustained upward demand regime confirmed: recent 5-period mean (Periods 6\u201310)=765.2 vs historical ~111; treat as new demand level until contradicted; Lead time confirmed = 4 periods (observed P1\u2013P4 arrivals, lead_time=4).

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Lead time confirmed at 4 periods from concluded arrivals (consistent across observed orders). Recent demand regime is elevated \u2014 recent 5-period mean (Periods 6\u201310) = 765.2 units \u2014 so forecast should use the most recent regime. On-hand = 0, in-transit = 3349 (sufficient pipeline but current period demand occurs after decision). Choose L by averaging observed lead times to reflect confirmed L=4; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the new high-demand regime and reduce stockouts while avoiding excessive holding given holding cost.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Period_13 with on-hand=0, in-transit=3828. Lead time: concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=4 (orders from P1\u2013P8 arrived with W=4). Demand: clear sustained upward regime \u2014 recent demands (Periods 8\u201312) = [776, 963, 863, 1136, 1221], 5-period mean \u2248 991.8 >> historical mean ~111. To cover review+lead demand I set L=default (promised 4). For demand scale I use recent_N (N=5) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean of the most recent 5 demands (captures the new high-demand regime). For volatility I use recent_N (N=5) to reflect current variability. These choices make the OR backend raise the base-stock to serve the elevated demand while using recent volatility to size safety stock and avoid excessive holding beyond the observed regime.

Carry-over insight: Sustained upward demand regime confirmed: recent 5-period mean (Periods 8\u201312)=991.8; treat as new demand level until contradicted; Lead time confirmed = 4 periods (arrivals for P1\u2013P8 all show lead_time=4).

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Lead time confirmed at 4 periods by multiple concluded arrivals (P1\u2013P9 arrivals with lead_time=4); use promised/default L. Demand has sustained a large upward shift \u2014 recent 5-period mean (Periods 9\u201313 demands = 963, 863, 1136, 1221, 1246; mean\u22481079.8) is far above historical pre-shift mean. To align OR base-stock with the new regime while keeping variability centered on recent behavior, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (captures the most recent regime). This ensures the backend orders to cover (1+L) periods of elevated demand and sets variability from the same window to balance service level vs holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Sustained upward demand regime confirmed: recent 5-period mean (Periods 9\u201313)=~1079.8; lead time confirmed = 4 periods (observed P1\u2013P9 arrivals, lead_time=4).

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Period_15. On-hand=0, in-transit=4634. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history (P1\u2013P9 arrivals show lead_time=4). Demand has shifted sharply upward; recent 5-period demands (Periods 10\u201314 = 863,1136,1221,1246,1265) show a sustained high regime (5-period mean \u22481146.2). I set L to default (promised = 4) because concluded arrivals confirm lead_time=4. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture the new high-demand regime so the OR engine targets a base-stock sized for (1+L)\xd7recent mean and volatility, balancing higher service level against holding cost given strong recent demand and large in-transit pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Sustained upward demand regime confirmed: recent 5-period mean (Periods 10\u201314)=~1146.2; treat as new demand level until contradicted; Lead time confirmed = 4 periods (observed P1\u2013P9 arrivals, lead_time=4).

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Observed context: Period_16 with on-hand=0 and large in-transit=4970. Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 4 periods and a sustained upward demand regime (recent 5-period mean of demands Periods 11\u201315 = 1275 units). Many prior orders arrived with 4-period lead time, so use promised/default L=4. To capture the new high-demand regime, set mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 (uses most recent 5 demands to forecast (1+L)-period demand). Volatility also updated to recent_N N=5 to reflect current demand variability. These choices ensure the OR backend targets service for the new demand level while accounting for observed lead time and recent variance.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Period_17. On-hand=0, in-transit=5288. Historical small-sample demands (initial) are obsolete \u2014 recent periods show a sustained, much higher demand regime. Lead time: concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4 (observed many periods), so use promised/default. Demand forecast: use recent 5-period sample to capture the elevated regime and avoid under-ordering. Volatility: use recent 5-period sample to reflect current demand variability. This balances service (avoid stockouts given high recent demand and large pipeline) against holding cost by tying forecasts to the current high-demand regime while relying on pipeline to cover near-term demand.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime continues: recent 5-period mean (Periods 12\u201316) = 1357.2 units; lead time confirmed = 4 periods (multiple concluded arrivals).

Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history (P1\u2013P13 arrivals), and demand shows a sustained high regime in recent periods. To reflect confirmed L=4 and capture the current high-demand regime I set L to default (promised=4) and use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the most recent 5 demand samples\u2014this targets service for current elevated demand while letting the backend's cap limit prevent extreme over-ordering.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Lead time repeatedly observed = 4 periods in concluded history; use promised default. Demand has settled into a sustained high regime \u2014 recent 5 periods (Periods 14\u201318) demands = [1265,1507,1547,1724,1802], mean=1569. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the new higher mean and volatility; this ensures the OR engine orders to cover (1+L) periods of this elevated demand while capping order size via the engine's cap. On-hand=0 and large in-transit=6167 already cover multiple review+lead periods, but parameters must reflect current demand to avoid underordering if shipments fail.

Carry-over insight: Sustained higher-demand regime confirmed: recent 5-period mean (Periods 14\u201318)=1569 (evidence: demands 1265,1507,1547,1724,1802); lead time confirmed = 4 periods (multiple concluded arrivals).

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

I set L=default to use the promised lead time (matches observed lead_time=4). I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the current high-demand regime ((1+L)\xd7recent mean) and recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture recent demand volatility; this balances service level against holding costs given high in-transit stock and confirmed lead time.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: lead time has been consistently observed = 4 periods in concluded history. Recent demand is in a sustained high regime; last 5 demands (Periods 16\u201320) = [1547,1724,1802,2075,1973], 5-period mean = 1824.2. On-hand=0, in-transit=7371 (~4.04 periods of recent demand) which is slightly below the (L+1)=5 periods cover target. I therefore keep L at the promised/observed value and set demand forecast and volatility based on the most recent 5-period regime so the OR backend base_stock ((1+L)*mean) matches the current high-demand level and will trigger orders to top up pipeline to cover 5 periods. Sigma set from recent 5 periods to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Sustained higher-demand regime: recent 5-period mean = 1824.2 (Periods 16\u201320); lead time confirmed = 4 periods (multiple concluded arrivals).

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_23: confirmed high-demand regime and stable lead time. Lead time observed = 4 periods in multiple concluded arrivals (P1\u2013P18). On-hand=0, in-transit=7905 (covers ~3.9\u20134+ periods at current demand); recent realized demands (Periods 18\u201322) = [1802,2075,1973,1983,2221], 5-period mean \u22482010.8. To match observed regime and keep service while controlling holding cost, use promised lead time (default=4) and set demand forecast and volatility from the most recent 5 periods so the OR backend targets the new higher base stock quickly.

Carry-over insight: Sustained higher-demand regime: recent 5-period mean \u22482010.8 (Periods 18\u201322: 1802,2075,1973,1983,2221). Lead time reliably 4 periods (multiple concluded arrivals).

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Period_24. On-hand=0, in-transit=8289. Recent concluded history shows consistent lead_time=4 and a sustained high-demand regime (most recent demands: Periods19\u201323 = 2075,1973,1983,2221,2326). Several large orders are in transit and arrivals have been reliable at 4 periods. I set L=default to use the promised lead time (matches observed lead_time=4). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture the current high-demand regime (focus on the last 5 demands) so the backend base-stock and cap reflect the elevated mean and volatility; this balances service level (avoid stockouts given high demand) versus holding cost by using recent regime stats rather than the long-run low-demand historical mean. On-hand + in-transit (8289) will be compared by the OR engine to the computed base_stock and pipeline when sizing the next order.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Period_25, on-hand=0, in-transit=8574. Historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time = 4 periods and a sustained high-demand regime; recent demands (Periods 20\u201324) = [1973,1983,2221,2326,2566], 5-period mean=2213.8. Changepoint evidence: demands jumped sharply from earlier low regime to a new high regime sustained across many periods and most recent 5-period mean supports that. No new lost-shipment signal (arrivals have been concluding on schedule). Decision: keep L as promised (default) since concluded arrivals consistently show 4-period lead time; set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the new high-demand regime over the review+lead window; set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility rather than long-run low-variance history. This raises the base-stock to cover (1+L)\xd7recent mean and increases safety stock consistent with higher demand, balancing service-level (avoid stockouts given large in-transit demand consumption) against holding cost given sizeable pipeline.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:

Using L=default (promised=4) because actual lead time is confirmed at 4. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N N=5 to capture the current high-demand regime; (1+L)*mean = 5*2340 = 11700 target pipeline coverage. Current on-hand=0 and in-transit=9248 < 11700, so the OR engine should replenish to restore service level while accounting for holding cost.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Demand has been in a sustained high regime with confirmed lead time=4 (multiple concluded arrivals). Recent demands (Periods 22\u201326 = 2221,2326,2566,2604,2645) show elevated mean (~2472). To match current regime and keep pipeline sized for (1+L) review+lead, use recent-N estimates (N=5) for both demand mean and volatility; keep L as default (promised/confirmed 4). This fills pipeline for the higher demand while avoiding overreacting to older low-demand samples; it also aligns safety-stock sizing to recent volatility.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime with confirmed lead time = 4 periods (multiple concluded arrivals). On-hand=0, in-transit=10279 (insufficient vs. (1+L)\xd7recent demand). I set L to promised (default=4) because concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture the current high-demand regime (use last 5 observed demands to compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This raises the base-stock to match current demand while sigma_hat recent_N captures recent volatility, balancing service level vs holding cost given large in-transit but zero on-hand.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed: recent 5-period mean (Periods 23\u201327) = 2606.2 units/period; lead time reliably = 4 periods (multiple concluded arrivals).

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Demand has been in a sustained high regime with recent 5-period mean ~2606 units (Periods 23\u201327) and lead time repeatedly confirmed at 4 periods. On-hand is 0 and large pipeline = 10847 units (covers multiple periods). To match the OR backend's review+lead demand horizon while keeping safety for high, recent demand, set L to the promised/confirmed 4. Use recent_N for mu_hat with N=5 to capture the current high-demand regime. Use default sigma_hat (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) since variability has been stable in concluded history and the backend's default volatility is appropriate given large pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime: recent 5-period mean \u22482606.2 (Periods 23\u201327); lead time reliably = 4 periods (multiple concluded arrivals).

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Lead time has been consistently observed =4 periods in concluded history; use promised/default for L. Recent demand is in a sustained high regime \u2014 most recent 5 demands (Periods 25\u201329) average \u22482719 units/period; use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture current level across the (1+L) review+lead window. On-hand=0 and in-transit=11610; (1+L)=5 periods \xd7 recent mean \u224813596 so pipeline is slightly short \u2014 parameters will cause OR engine to target a base-stock that raises pipeline to cover the elevated demand while capping orders to limit excess holding given holding cost= $1/unit.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Period_32. Demand has been in a sustained high regime; recent demands (Periods 27\u201331 = 2890,2643,2814,2873,3046) average \u22482853 per period. Promised lead time is 4 and historical concluded arrivals confirm lead_time=4. On-hand=0, in-transit=11396 \u2248 4.0 recent-periods of demand (11396/2853\u22484), so pipeline roughly covers lead time. Decision: keep L at promised (confirmed=4), set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent 5 periods to capture the current high-demand regime and recent volatility so OR backend sizes base stock to meet elevated demand while limiting excess holding. Using recent_N=5 focuses estimation on the current regime and aligns pipeline coverage with the observed lead time.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 33. On-hand=0, in-transit=11469. Historical concludes show consistent lead_time=4 for concluded orders through Period_32, so use promised/observed L=4. Demand has settled at a high regime; recent demands (Periods 28\u201332 = 2643,2814,2873,3046,3005) average \u22482876. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture the current high-demand regime and recent volatility, ensuring the OR backend targets service for the elevated demand while capping order size via its cap. High in-transit (11469) plus base-stock tuned to recent demand will avoid excess hold cost while maintaining service.

Carry-over insight: Sustained higher-demand regime: recent 5-period mean (Periods 28\u201332) \u22482876 units/period; lead time reliably = 4 periods (concluded arrivals through Period_32).

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Lead time confirmed = 4 periods from multiple concluded arrivals (P1\u2013P29).

Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to forecast (1+L)\xd7recent mean so the base-stock reflects the current high-demand regime and covers review+lead horizon. Use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture current volatility. This balances service (high demand) against holding cost given large in-transit volume (11150) and zero on-hand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $5792.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent concluded arrivals (through Period_34) consistently show lead_time=4 and demand has settled at a much higher level (recent 5-period demands Periods 30\u201334 mean \u22483136.6 vs long-run historical ~111). On-hand is 0 and in-transit=11650 (covers several future periods). I set L to default to use the promised lead time (which matches observed lead_time=4). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the sustained high-demand regime (responsive to the latest 5 periods). For sigma_hat I also use recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility and ensure the OR engine's base-stock calculation and cap reflect current demand dispersion.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime: recent 5-period mean (Periods 30\u201334) \u22483136.6; lead time reliably 4 periods (concluded arrivals through Period_34).

Daily Reward (R_t): $4350.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Lead time reliably observed = 4 periods across concluded arrivals. Demand has shifted to a sustained high regime; use recent 5-period demand to capture current level and volatility. On-hand=0 but in-transit=12992 (ample pipeline covering multiple periods); avoid over-ordering by setting L=default (promised=4), mu_hat=recent_N N=5 to align base-stock with current demand, sigma_hat=recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. This balances service (high recent demand) vs holding cost given large pipeline.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Demand has been in a sustained high regime (recent periods >> historical). Lead time reliably observed = 4 periods. Use L=default to keep promised lead time (matches observed). Forecast demand across review+lead using recent 5-period average to capture current high-demand regime and avoid diluting with old low-demand samples. Use recent 5-period volatility for sigma to reflect current variability and size orders to meet service while controlling holding cost given high turnover.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Period_38. On-hand=0, in-transit=13595. Lead time has been consistently observed = 4 periods in concluded history. Recent demand has risen to a sustained high regime: last 5 demands (Periods 33\u201337) = [3391,3368,3282,3448,3748], mean\u22483447.4. Pipeline (~13595) covers ~3.9 periods at this demand level; to avoid stockouts ensure (1+L)-period coverage is targeted. Chosen methods: L=default to use promised lead time (4) consistent with observed confirmations; mu_hat=recent_N (N=5) to capture the new high-demand regime; sigma_hat=recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These settings steer the OR engine to set a base stock tuned to the elevated recent mean while using recent variability for service-level sizing, balancing profit vs holding cost given large in-transit but still-insufficient coverage.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed: recent 5-period mean (Periods 33\u201337) \u22483447.4 units/period; lead time reliably = 4 periods (multiple concluded arrivals).

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent concluded arrivals confirm lead time = 4. Demand is in a sustained high regime: recent 5-period demands (Periods 34\u201338) = [3368,3282,3448,3748,3929], mean \u2248 3555. On-hand=0, in-transit=13940 (sufficient pipeline). I set L=default to use promised lead time (confirmed=4). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) so the backend targets the current high-demand level and captures recent volatility; this balances service (avoid stockouts given high demand) against holding cost given large in-transit inventory.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed: recent 5-period mean (Periods 34\u201338) \u22483555 units/period; lead time reliably = 4 periods (multiple concluded arrivals).

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Period_40 with on-hand=0, in-transit=14428. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods. Recent demand is in a sustained high regime; last 5 demands (Periods 35\u201339) = [3282,3448,3748,3929,4212], mean \u2248 3723.8. I set L=default to use promised/confirmed lead time=4. I choose mu_hat recent_N (N=5) to capture the current high-demand regime ((1+L)\xd7recent mean). I choose sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These settings align pipeline coverage to the new demand level while avoiding excess hold given high holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime: recent 5-period mean \u22483723.8 (Periods 35\u201339). Lead time reliably = 4 periods (multiple concluded arrivals).

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_41: recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime with confirmed lead time=4 (many concluded arrivals at LT=4). On-hand=0, in-transit=15488 \u2014 ample pipeline covering several future periods. I keep L as default (promised 4) since conclude history confirms LT=4. I set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current high-demand level (most recent 5 periods demand mean ~3959.6 scaled by (1+L) internally). I set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility around this high-demand regime. These choices align the OR engine to target service under the new demand level while avoiding overstatement from older low-demand samples.

Daily Reward (R_t): $6814.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Context: Period_42. Recent demand has been in a sustained high regime (Periods 37\u201341 demands = 3748,3929,4212,4461,4166; recent 5-period mean=4103.2). Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods in concluded history. On-hand=0, in-transit=16690 (sufficient pipeline but demand is high). Decision: keep promised lead time (default) = 4; set demand forecast using recent 5-period mean to capture current high-demand regime (mu_hat recent_N, N=5 -> (1+L)*mean); set sigma_hat using recent 5-period volatility to reflect current variability (sigma_hat recent_N, N=5). These choices align the OR base-stock calculation to the new high-demand level while using recent variance to set safety stock, balancing service level vs holding cost given large pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime persists: recent 5-period mean (Periods 37\u201341)=4103.2 units/period; lead time reliably = 4 periods (multiple concluded arrivals).

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Period_43. On-hand=0, In-transit=17039. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=4. Recent demands are in a sustained high-demand regime (last 5 periods high). I set L to default (promised lead time=4) because concluded history confirms it. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current high-demand regime (avoids dilution from much lower early-period demand). This guides the OR backend to target inventory for the elevated demand while keeping variability estimates current.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime: recent 5-period mean (Periods 38\u201342) = 4161.6 units/period; lead time reliably = 4 periods (multiple concluded arrivals).

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent concluded arrivals confirm lead time = 4 and demand remains in a sustained high regime. Last 5 observed demands (Periods 39\u201343) average ~4,166 units/period; pipeline is large (in-transit=16997) but on-hand is low (55). Use recent 5-period demand stats so OR base-stock reflects current high demand and confirmed L=4; use recent 5-period volatility to capture current variability.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed: recent 5-period mean (Periods 39\u201343) \u22484166 units/period; lead time reliably = 4 periods (multiple concluded arrivals).

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period: Period_45. Lead time has been consistently observed = 4 periods in concluded history (many arrivals with lead_time=4). Recent demand remains in the high regime \u2014 last 5 demands (Periods 40\u201344) = [4461, 4166, 4040, 3950, 4444], recent 5-period mean = 4212.2. On-hand=0, in-transit=16627 which is short of (1+L)*recent_mean \u22485*4212.2=21061; pipeline likely insufficient to cover the review+lead horizon so we should target the high-demand regime using recent data. Therefore: set L to promised/default (4), set mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture current high-demand level, and set sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters push the OR backend to raise the base stock to meet elevated demand while using recent variance for safety stock.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 46: demand has been in a sustained high regime with confirmed lead time = 4 (multiple concluded arrivals). On-hand=245, in-transit=16613 which plus order coverage implies large pipeline. To capture the recent high-demand regime I set demand estimates from the most recent 5 periods to align base-stock to current demand; keep L at promised/default (4) since lead time is confirmed. Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat focuses the OR engine on the last stable high-demand regime and balances service level vs holding cost given high pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed (recent 5-period mean >> historical small-sample mean); lead time reliably = 4 periods (multiple concluded arrivals).

On-hand=0, in-transit=16831 which roughly covers multiple periods but we continue to target the recent 5-period demand profile to size review+lead demand. Set L to default (promised/confirmed 4), use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture current high-demand regime, and keep sigma_hat at default to let backend scale volatility by sqrt(1+L).

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period: Period_48. On-hand=0, in-transit=18756. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods. Demand has been in a sustained high regime for many periods (recent 5-period means well above the tiny initial sample). To match the OR engine (which lacks news/regime info) I set L to promised (use default=4) and set demand estimates using the most recent data window to capture the sustained high-demand regime. I choose recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the most recent 5 demand samples, which balances service level (high demand) against holding cost given large pipeline. This approach prevents under-ordering from using the tiny initial-sample mean while still respecting the backend's computations.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed (recent multi-period means >> initial small-sample mean); actual lead time reliably = 4 periods (multiple concluded arrivals).

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_49 decision. On-hand=0, in-transit=18163. Lead time reliably 4 periods (multiple concluded arrivals at lead_time=4). Recent demand has been very large; last 5 demands (Periods 44\u201348) = 4444,4364,4530,4595,4776 (mean=4541.8). To reflect the sustained high-demand regime and minimize stockouts, set L to promised (default) and use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes demand over (1+L) periods using the current high-demand mean and volatility. This balances service-level (avoid lost sales) against holding cost given large in-transit pipeline.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Lead time confirmed = 4 periods from concluded arrivals. On-hand=0, in-transit=18266 units; recent 5-period mean demand (Periods 45\u201349) \u22484670.4 units \u2192 pipeline covers ~3.9 periods, short of target (L+1=5). Use recent-5 demand estimates to capture the clearly sustained high-demand regime and raise the review+lead forecast; use recent-5 volatility to reflect current variability. This ensures OR base_stock targets the elevated regime while acknowledging confirmed L=4.
