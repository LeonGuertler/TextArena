Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. No on-hand or in-transit inventory and no 'conclude' messages to infer actual lead time or lost shipments. Historical demand samples = [112,97,116,138,94], mean=111.4. Use promised lead time (default) L=2 because no observed arrivals to justify changing it. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service vs. holding costs given available data and avoids overreacting to limited history.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_2: recent realized demand samples = [112,97,116,138,94] (mean=111.4). On-hand=0, in-transit=141 (order placed in Period_1 that has not yet arrived). Promised lead time=2 periods; no concluded arrivals to contradict that, but the Period_1 conclude shows arrived=0 for the Period_1 order, so shipment may be delayed or lost. To avoid overreacting to a single missing conclude, use default promised lead time (L=default) and default demand estimates so the OR engine applies (1+L)\xd7historical mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This balances service (use full-sample mean) against holding cost while preserving conservatism given possible delayed shipment.

Carry-over insight: Recent order of 141 placed in Period_1 has not concluded (arrived=0 in Period_1 conclude) \u2014 possible delayed or lost shipment; monitor next concludes for confirmation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3: on-hand=0, in-transit=279 (matches orders 141+138). Promised L=2 and no concluded arrivals yet; observed non-conclusions likely reflect normal 2-period lead time (orders placed in P1/P2 would conclude later) rather than confirmed loss. Recent demand spike (246 in Period_2) looks like an outlier vs. historical samples [112,97,116,138,94]; I remain conservative and use defaults based on full historical samples to avoid overreacting to a single spike. Using default L keeps promised lead time (2) and sets mu_hat and sigma_hat to (1+L)-scaled mean/std of all samples so the OR backend balances service level versus holding cost given uncertain arrivals and high in-transit volume.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_4 start. Recent concludes show three consecutive orders (Periods 1-3) with arrived=0 while in-transit=424 \u2192 likely delayed/lost shipments; demand has spiked recently (Period1 demand=91, Period2=246, Period3=285) indicating a higher recent demand regime. I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect extended/uncertain lead time beyond promised 2 so the OR engine stages more pipeline cover. For demand I use recent_N with N=3 (most recent three demands) to capture the new, higher mean; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=3 to reflect elevated recent volatility. These choices increase target base-stock and cap pipeline orders to better service the recent high demand while acknowledging shipment risk.

Carry-over insight: Delayed/lost shipments signal: orders placed in Periods 1-3 all concluded arrived=0 while in-transit=424; treat lead time as extended until concludes show arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $848.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 decision: recent concludes show previously delayed arrivals with variable lead times (orders placed in Periods 1-3 concluded in Period 4 with lead_times 3,2,1). On-hand=0, in-transit=377; demand has jumped sharply since Period 2 (Period2-4 demands: 246,285,437) indicating a sustained higher-demand regime. Set L via 'calculate' to let backend use observed lead times avg. Forecast mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the post-change high mean and elevated variance (uses Periods 2-4 demands). This balances service (cover elevated demand over review+lead period) against holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Carry-over insight: Observed lead times for arrivals in Period 4: orders from Period1\u21923 had lead_times 3,2,1 respectively; average observed lead time ~2 periods. Demand regime shifted up starting Period 2 (Period2-4 mean=~322.7).

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Period_6. On-hand=0, in-transit=866. Recent concludes show delayed arrivals earlier but Period_4 conclude revealed actual lead_times for orders placed in Periods 1-3 were 3,2,1 (avg ~2). Demand regime shifted up starting Period_2 (recent demands much higher). I set L using observed lead-times (calculate) to capture actual average lead time. For demand I use recent_N (N=4) to capture the new high-demand regime (Periods 2-5). For sigma_hat I also use recent_N (N=4) to reflect recent volatility. These choices ensure the OR backend builds base_stock and cap around the elevated recent mean while accounting for the inferred longer lead time and current pipeline to balance service level vs holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime increased starting Period_2; recent Periods 2-5 mean demand=354 units (n=4). Observed lead times from concluded arrivals (Period_4 conclude) = 3,2,1 \u2192 average ~2 periods.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_7: recent demand regime up since Period_2 (Period2-5 demands 246,285,437,448; mean=354 over last 4). Concluded arrivals show variable lead times (3,2,1,2,1) \u2192 average ~2. Use calculate for L to let backend average observed lead times. Use recent_N N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the higher recent demand regime (N=4 chosen because changepoint at Period_2 yields 4-sample recent regime). This balances service (higher mean) against holding cost by reflecting recent demand and variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $558.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_8: recent demand regime is elevated since Period_2 (large demands Periods 2\u20137) and shipments have shown variable but shorter-than-promised lead times. On-hand=0, in-transit=1168 (covers future demand partially). Observed concluded lead times = [3,2,1,2,1] \u2192 avg \u22481.8 periods, so I let the backend compute L from observed history (calculate) to reflect actual mean. Demand appears to have shifted up starting Period_2; to capture the recent higher mean and higher variance I use recent_N with N=5 (most recent 5 demand samples Period_3\u20137) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the base-stock and safety stock reflect the new regime and recent volatility while avoiding old low demand in Period_1. This balances service-level (higher forecast) against holding cost given substantial pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime increased starting Period_2 (Period_2\u20137 high demands; recent 5-period mean = 478.8); observed realized lead times from concluded arrivals average \u22481.8 periods (samples: 3,2,1,2,1).

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9: recent demand regime is elevated since Period 2 (P2\u2013P8 demands: 246,285,437,448,587,637,776). On-hand=0, in-transit=1871 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times = [3,2,1,2,1] \u2192 avg \u22481.8. Set L by averaging observed lead times to reflect realized ~2-period lead time (method=calculate). Forecast demand across review+lead using recent data from the elevated regime (use recent_N with N=7 for P2\u2013P8) so mu_hat captures the higher mean and (1+L) multiplier. Use recent_N (N=7) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility rather than long-run low-variance samples. These choices bias orders toward meeting the sustained higher demand while accounting for the observed ~2-period lead time and large in-transit stock to avoid over-ordering.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_10: on-hand=0, in-transit=1926. Recent demand jumped starting Period_2; latest 8-period mean (Periods 2\u20139) = 547.375 indicating a higher demand regime. Concluded arrivals show realized lead_times = [3,2,1,2,1] \u2192 average \u22481.8 (n=5). Some shipments arrived late but most concluded within ~2 periods; use observed lead-time average (calculate) to reflect realized behaviour. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=8) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime while letting the OR backend compute risk buffer; this balances service (higher forecast) against holding cost given profit/holding=$2/$1.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime increased starting Period_2; mean demand Periods_2\u20139 = 547.375 (n=8). Observed realized lead times from concluded arrivals = [3,2,1,2,1], average \u22481.8 (n=5).

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_11: on-hand=0, in-transit=2170. History shows realized lead times from concluded arrivals = [3,2,1,2,1] \u2192 avg \u22481.8 periods and demand regime increased starting Period_2 (recent high demands). Several past orders were delayed but most eventually concluded with avg lead_time \u22482, so use observed-average lead time. Use recent demand window (most recent 8 periods since regime shift at Period_2) to capture elevated demand for mu and sigma. This balances service (higher mu to cover elevated demand + in-transit) against holding cost given large pipeline: using recent_N increases forecast to reduce stockouts while sigma recent_N captures higher variability to set safety stock.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_12 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=2373 \u2014 large pipeline likely covers several future periods but some past shipments were delayed. Observed concluded lead_times = [3,2,1,2,1,2] \u2192 avg \u22481.83 periods; use calculated average to reflect realized lead-time shorter than promised 2 but with variability. Demand regime shifted up starting Period_2; use recent demand (most recent regime) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat so orders reflect elevated demand. Choosing L='calculate' to capture observed lead-time average; mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=10 to base forecast on the last 10 periods of the elevated-demand regime and its volatility. This balances higher service level against holding cost given large pipeline and continued high demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime increased starting Period_2; recent 10-period mean is elevated (use recent_N=10). Observed realized lead times from concluded arrivals = [3,2,1,2,1,2], average \u22481.83 (n=6) \u2014 treat lead time as ~1.8 periods until future concludes show change.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13: recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime starting Period 2 (large increases through Periods 2\u201312). Observed concluded lead times from arrivals = [3,2,1,2,1,2,2,1], average \u22481.75 \u2192 use calculated average. Use recent_N=10 for demand estimates to capture the elevated regime (Periods 3\u201312 approximately) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect current high demand while smoothing older low-demand samples. These settings help the OR backend size base stock for ~(1+L) review+lead demand under the current high-demand regime and account for observed lead-time lengthening, reducing stockouts while limiting excess holding given holding cost.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_14: demand has been in an elevated regime since Period_2 with large recent demands and on-hand=0, in-transit=2805. Concluded arrivals show realized lead times = [3,2,1,2,1,2,2,1] (average 1.75, n=8) \u2014 evidence of shorter-than-promised but variable lead times. To capture recent lead-time variability use recent_N over the last 8 observed lead times. For demand, recent periods show a sustained higher regime; use recent_N=10 to forecast (1+L)-period demand based on the last 10 demand samples. Use recent_N=10 for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These choices align the OR base-stock estimate with the elevated demand and observed lead-time distribution, helping balance service level (avoid stockouts given high demand and large in-transit) against holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime increased starting Period_2; recent-period mean elevated (use recent_N=10 for forecasts). Observed realized lead times from concluded arrivals = [3,2,1,2,1,2,2,1], average \u22481.75 (n=8) \u2014 treat lead time ~1.75 until further changes observed.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15: demand has been in a higher regime since Period 2 with recent high demands and pipeline=2005 on-hand=0. Concluded arrival lead_times across history average ~1.75\u20131.8 (samples from concluded messages). To reflect the observed shorter-than-promised lead time but allow responsiveness to recent variability, set L using recent_N to average the last 8 observed lead times. For demand forecast use recent_N with N=10 to capture the sustained elevated regime (changepoint at Period 2). Use default sigma (sqrt(1+L)*std of all samples) so volatility is estimated from full sample while keeping parameter set simple. These choices raise target base-stock to cover the review+lead period under higher demand while L captures empirically shorter lead_time, balancing service level vs holding cost given large in-transit stock and history of delayed then rapid arrivals.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_16: on-hand=0, in-transit=3058. Recent concluded arrivals imply realized lead times = [3,2,1,2,1,2,2,1,2,1,1] (n=11), avg \u22481.64 periods \u2192 use calculated average lead time. Demand has been elevated since Period_2; to capture the recent high-demand regime use recent_N=10 for demand forecast and volatility. Using L=calculate lets the OR backend target (1+L)-period demand with updated empirical L; recent_N for mu_hat/sigma_hat focuses the forecast on the elevated regime and recent variability. This accounts for past delayed arrivals (lost/delayed shipments earlier) by using observed lead-time behavior rather than the promised lead time, and keeps safety sizing responsive to current demand to balance service vs holding costs. Current pipeline (3058) should cover several future periods given elevated demand but we rely on OR engine to cap orders per its policy.

Carry-over insight: Updated observed lead-time average \u22481.64 periods (n=11) based on concluded arrivals through Period_15; demand regime elevated starting Period_2 \u2014 use recent_N=10 for forecasting.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=3628 \u2014 substantial pipeline but no on-hand stock for current-period demand. Historical concludes show a sustained elevated demand regime starting Period_2; concluded arrivals yield an observed lead-time average \u22481.64 periods (n=11). To keep service vs. holding balanced: set L explicitly to observed 1.64 to reflect realized arrivals; forecast demand using recent_N=10 to capture the elevated regime; use recent_N=10 for sigma to reflect recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime elevated starting Period_2 (use recent_N=10 for forecasts); observed realized lead time \u22481.64 periods (n=11) \u2014 treat lead time ~1.64 until new conclude evidence.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_18: on-hand=0, in-transit=3628. Historical concluded arrivals show elevated demand regime beginning Period_2 and realized lead times averaging ~1.64 periods (n=11). Many past orders experienced delayed arrivals but recent concludes stabilize around avg lead time ~1.64. To capture the elevated demand I use a recent_N=10 forecast for mu_hat and sigma_hat (matches prior guidance to use recent_N=10). To account for observed lead-time elongation vs promised 2, I set L explicitly to the observed average 1.64 so the OR backend sizes orders to cover (1+L) periods under the current regime and avoids over-ordering given holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime elevated starting Period_2 (use recent_N=10 for forecasts); observed realized lead time \u22481.64 periods (n=11) \u2014 treat lead time ~1.64 until new conclude evidence.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_19: demand has been on an elevated regime since Period_2 with very high recent demands; on-hand=0, in-transit=1871 (large pipeline). Concluded arrivals through Period_18 give observed lead times \u22481.64 periods (n\u224811) \u2014 shipments have varied but stabilized below promised 2. To reflect the shorter realized lead time and recent high-demand regime, set L explicitly to 1.64 so pipeline horizon matches observed arrivals. Use recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to forecast (1+L)-period demand using the most recent regime data and capture recent volatility. This balances higher service level (protect vs. stockouts under elevated demand) against holding cost given large in-transit volume.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime elevated starting Period_2 (sustained high demands; use recent_N=10 for forecasts); observed realized lead time stabilized \u22481.64 periods (n\u224811) \u2014 treat lead time ~1.64 until new conclude evidence.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20: demand has been in a sustained high regime since Period_2 (very large recent demands, pipeline=3710, on-hand=0). Concluded arrivals through Period_19 imply realized lead time ~1.64 periods and elevated recent demand \u2014 use that lead-time estimate explicitly to account for delayed arrivals. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=10 to capture the elevated demand regime in the last 10 periods. This increases target base-stock to meet high near-term demand while sigma_hat recent_N captures current volatility; explicit L=1.64 prevents the OR engine from underestimating lead time due to lost/delayed shipments.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 21: demand has been in a sustained elevated regime since Period_2. On-hand=0, in-transit=2212 (large pipeline but arrivals will be delayed by observed lead times). Historical concluded lead-times average \u22481.64 periods (n\u224811), so I set L explicit=1.64 to reflect shorter-than-promised but nonzero delay. Use recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to forecast (1+L)-period demand using the most recent elevated regime and capture current volatility. This balances higher service level need (high demand) against holding cost by basing base-stock on recent high-demand samples while accounting for measured lead-time risk.

Set L explicit to 1.64 to reflect observed effective lead time (helps avoid under-ordering given in-transit ambiguity). Use recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base forecast and volatility on the most recent elevated-demand regime (balances service vs holding cost by capturing current mean/variability).

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_23: on-hand=0, in-transit=4201. Recent concluded lead-times (from conclude history through Period_22) show samples ~[3,2,1,2,1,2,2,1,3,2,1,2] (most recent 11 averaging \u22481.64). Demand has been in an elevated regime since Period_2; recent 10-period demand average is the best short-term anchor. Given large pipeline, I use a recent-average lead time to reflect realized delays and recent demand-window methods for mu/sigma so the OR backend stocks to the higher demand regime while limiting additional over-ordering against current in-transit inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime elevated starting Period_2 (sustained high demand); observed realized lead time stabilized \u22481.64 periods based on ~11 concluded samples (use recent_N=11 for L).

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_24: on-hand=0, in-transit=5455; demand has been in a sustained high regime since Period_2. Concluded arrivals through Period_23 yield observed lead times averaging \u22481.64 over ~11 concluded samples and a clearly elevated recent demand level. To capture the sustained higher demand I use a recent-window forecast for mu and sigma (recent_N=10) to weight recent high demands while keeping volatility measured over the same window. For lead time I use recent_N=11 to reflect the ~1.64-period realized lead time from concluded arrivals. These settings bias the OR backend toward higher base-stock to avoid stockouts given long in-transit pipeline and elevated demand, while sigma_hat recentization prevents underestimating variability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime elevated starting Period_2 (sustained high demand); observed realized lead time stabilized \u22481.64 periods based on ~11 concluded arrivals \u2014 use recent_N windows for forecasting and L estimation until new conclude evidence.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_25: on-hand=0, in-transit=3508; recent concluded lead-times stabilized \u22481.64 periods (n\u224811) and demand regime has been elevated since Period_2. No new conclude in Period_24 to change regimes. I set L using recent_N to reflect observed realized lead-time average from concluded arrivals (captures lost/delayed shipments history). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=10 to capture the elevated, sustained demand regime (recent 10-period window) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L) demand and volatility over review+lead period, balancing service (higher mu_hat) against holding cost given high in-transit inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime elevated starting Period_2 (sustained high demand); realized lead time stabilized \u22481.64 periods based on ~11 concluded arrivals \u2014 use recent_N windows for forecasting and L estimation until new conclude evidence.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_26: on-hand=0, large in-transit=5657. Historical concludes show a sustained elevated demand regime starting Period_2 and realized lead times averaging ~1.64\u20131.75 with ~11 concluded samples. Pipeline is large but arrivals are delayed by multi-period lead times; to account for the empirically observed lead-time regime use a recent-leadtime estimate. For demand forecasting use a recent-window to capture the elevated regime (avoids dilution by early low-demand samples). Therefore: L estimated from the most recent 11 observed lead-times (recent_N=11) to reflect the stabilized ~1.64 periods; mu_hat and sigma_hat computed from the most recent 10 demand samples (recent_N=10) to capture the elevated demand mean and volatility. These settings bias the OR base-stock upward to meet high demand while using recent volatility to size safety stock, mitigating stockouts given delayed arrivals.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_27: demand regime remains elevated since Period_2 (recent high demands). Concluded arrivals through Period_26 give ~1.64 period observed lead time (n\u224811); many recent concludes support using recent lead-time average rather than promised 2. On-hand=1141 + in-transit=3108 provides substantial pipeline but demand remains high so forecasts should use recent demand. Set L using recent_N (N=11) to reflect observed lead-time mean ~1.64. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=10) to capture the elevated recent-demand regime for the review+lead period and its volatility. These parameters align the OR base-stock target with realized lead time and recent high demand, balancing service level against holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_28: on-hand=0, in-transit=5851. Demand has been in a sustained elevated regime since Period_2; concluded arrivals through Period_27 imply realized lead time ~1.6\u20131.7 periods. Many recent shipments have arrived 1\u20133 periods after order but average ~1.64 (n\u224811). To cover the elevated demand regime while accounting for the slightly shorter-than-promised realized lead time, I set L using a recent-window average of observed lead times (N=11). Forecast (mu_hat) and uncertainty (sigma_hat) use recent_N with N=10 to capture the elevated-demand regime while keeping responsiveness to recent changes. This balances higher service level (protecting against stockouts given large pipeline and high demand) versus holding cost by limiting the forecast window to recent data.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime elevated starting Period_2 (sustained high demand); realized lead time stabilized \u22481.64 periods based on ~11 concluded arrivals \u2014 use recent_N windows for forecasting and L estimation until new conclude evidence.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29: on-hand=0, in-transit=7619. Demand has been in a sustained elevated regime since Period_2. Concluded arrivals history shows realized lead times clustering ~1.6\u20131.8 periods; pipeline is large but arrivals lag due to multi-period lead times. I choose L by averaging recent concluded lead-time samples to reflect the stabilized ~1.6 periods (recent_N). For demand forecast and volatility I use recent_N window to capture the elevated demand regime (recent 10 periods) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current high-demand mean and variance. These choices keep base-stock responsive to higher demand while accounting for observed extended lead time and avoiding under-ordering given large in-transit but delayed arrivals.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_30: demand has been in a sustained elevated regime since Period_2; recent realized lead times (concluded arrivals) stabilized \u22481.64 periods (n\u224811). Current inventory: on-hand=191, in-transit=4855 \u2014 substantial pipeline but some past shipments showed multi-period delays; no currently unaccounted overdue conclues. I set L to recent_N (N=11) to reflect the empirically observed lead-time regime (~1.64) rather than the promised 2. For demand forecast mu_hat and volatility sigma_hat I use recent_N (N=10) to capture the elevated recent-demand regime while smoothing older low-demand samples. These settings bias the backend base-stock upward to protect service during high demand while using recent volatility to size safety stock appropriately given observed lead-time variability and past delayed arrivals.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_31: on-hand=0, in-transit=7856; demand has been in elevated regime since Period_2. Concluded arrivals through Period_30 show realized lead times averaging ~1.64 periods (recent concluded samples). To respect observed shorter-than-promised lead time while remaining robust to variability, set L using recent observed lead times (recent_N=11). Forecast demand using recent elevated regime (use recent_N=10 to capture latest mean over last 10 demand periods). Use recent_N for sigma_hat (N=10) to reflect recent volatility. Large in-transit position means orders will be capped by pipeline; these parameters aim to align target base-stock to recent high demand while accounting for observed lead-time distribution and recent variability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $5896.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_32: demand has been on an elevated regime since Period_2 (recent high demands; historical samples reflect large increases). On-hand=196, in-transit=5356 \u2014 pipeline is large so orders should top up to cover lead time+review. Concluded arrivals through Period_31 imply realized lead times average ~1.64 periods (use recent observed samples). I therefore set L using recent_N to capture the stabilized observed lead time history (N=11). For demand forecast and volatility I use recent_N window to reflect the sustained higher-demand regime (use N=10 as recommended for recent-period forecasting). These choices make mu_hat reflect (1+L)\xd7recent mean demand and sigma_hat capture recent volatility, balancing higher service targets against holding cost given large pipeline.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_33: on-hand=0, in-transit=8440. Demand has been in a sustained elevated regime starting Period_2; recent concludes show mixed lead times (1\u20133) that average ~1.64 periods based on ~11 concluded arrivals. Because shipments have sometimes been delayed but recent concluded lead-times are stable, I set L by averaging recent concluded lead-times and forecast demand using the recent elevated regime (10-period window) to capture the current high mean and volatility. This balances higher service level (higher mu_hat) against holding cost given large in-transit volume.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime elevated starting Period_2 (use recent_N=10 for forecasts); observed realized lead time stabilized \u22481.64 periods based on ~11 concluded arrivals (use recent_N for L estimation).

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34: demand has been in a sustained elevated regime since Period_2; on-hand=0, in-transit=8404. Concluded arrivals through Period_33 give ~11 observed lead-time samples with mean \u22481.64 periods and a clearly higher recent demand \u2014 use recent-window estimates to reflect the new regime. I choose L as recent_N (N=11) to capture the empirically observed lead-time (~1.64) rather than promised=2; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N (N=10) to base the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility on the most recent elevated-demand window. These settings align the backend base-stock calculation with the higher recent demand and the shorter realized lead time, while limiting overstock from older low-demand samples and addressing past delayed shipments by relying only on concluded lead-time evidence.

To capture stabilized lead time use recent_N=11 for L. To forecast elevated demand and recent volatility use recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat (captures the most recent regime while smoothing older noise). These choices prioritize service (higher base stock from recent high demand) while letting the OR engine cap orders to limit excess holding given large in-transit pipeline.

Historical concludes show a sustained elevated demand regime starting Period_2 and realized lead-times stabilized around ~1.64 periods based on ~11 concluded arrivals. Several past shipments were delayed but recent concludes are consistent, so use recent-window estimates: set L via recent_N to capture the observed average realized lead time (use N=11), set demand forecast (mu_hat) from recent demand regime using recent_N=10 to reflect the elevated mean, and set sigma_hat from recent demand volatility using recent_N=10.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_37: on-hand=0, in-transit=10295. Concluded arrivals history shows realized lead times clustered around ~1.64 periods (n\u224811) and demand has been in a sustained elevated regime since Period_2. With large pipeline present but no on-hand stock, set L using recent concluded lead-times and forecast demand using the recent high-demand regime (10-period window) so mu_hat reflects current elevated demand over the review+lead horizon and sigma_hat captures recent volatility. This balances service (avoid stockouts while long/variable lead-times persist) against holding cost given already-large in-transit inventory.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_38: on-hand=0, in-transit=9453. Historical concludes show a sustained higher-demand regime beginning Period_2 and realized lead times that stabilized around ~1.64 periods based on ~11 concluded arrivals. Several past shipments were delayed but recent concludes indicate lead-time ~1.6\u20131.8. To capture the elevated demand and the empirically shorter-than-promised lead-time, I use recent_N windows: estimate L from recent concluded lead-times (N=10) and forecast demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) from the last 10 demand samples (1+L multiplier applied by backend). This balances service (higher mu_hat to meet elevated demand) against holding cost given large pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime elevated starting Period_2 (sustained high demand; use recent_N windows for forecasts); observed realized lead time stabilized \u22481.64 periods based on ~11 concluded arrivals (use recent_N for L estimation).

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_39: demand regime has been elevated since Period_2 with high recent demands; on-hand=910 and in-transit=6503 (ample pipeline). Concluded arrivals history shows realized lead times ~1.6\u20131.8 periods; to capture this I set L using recent lead-time samples. For demand forecasting I use recent_N=10 (reflecting the sustained elevated regime) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the base-stock reflects current higher mean and volatility. This balances service (higher mu_hat for elevated demand) against holding cost given large pipeline.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period_40: on-hand=0, in-transit=10395, recent demand regime is elevated since Period_2. Concluded arrivals history shows stabilized realized lead time \u22481.64 periods (based on ~11 concluded samples). Pipeline is large but arrival timing uncertain; use recent observed lead-time average and recent-demand window to reflect current high-demand regime and to size (1+L) demand forecast accordingly.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime elevated starting Period_2 (sustained high demand; use recent_N=10 for forecasts); realized lead time stabilized \u22481.64 periods based on ~11 concluded arrivals (use recent_N window for L estimation).

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_41: on-hand=0, in-transit=12507. Demand has been in a higher regime since Period_2; concluded arrivals history (many samples) shows realized lead time stabilized ~1.64 periods. To match observed lead-time behavior and elevated recent demand I set L using recent observed lead times and forecast demand using a recent window. Choices: L -> recent_N N=11 to reflect the ~1.64-period observed lead-time average (11 concluded samples); mu_hat -> recent_N N=10 to capture elevated recent-demand regime (use (1+L)*mean of last 10 demands); sigma_hat -> recent_N N=10 to reflect recent volatility. This balances service (higher mu_hat for elevated demand and slightly >promised L) versus holding cost given large in-transit pipeline: using recent windows adapts to current regime while letting the OR engine cap orders via its cap rule to avoid excessive same-period ordering.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_42: on-hand=0, in-transit=13119. Historical concluded arrivals show a sustained elevated demand regime beginning Period_2 and recent realized lead times averaging \u22481.64 periods (\u224811 concluded samples). Pipeline is large but arrivals are observed with ~1.6\u20131.7p lag; use recent lead-time estimate to size (1+L) review+lead demand. I set L via recent_N to capture the empirical lead-time regime (N=11). For demand forecast and volatility use recent_N=10 to focus the base-stock on the most recent elevated-demand regime (stable since Period_2). These choices aim to keep base-stock aligned with current high demand while using empirically observed lead time to avoid under-ordering given past delayed arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime elevated starting Period_2 (sustained high demand); use recent-period windows for forecasting. Observed realized lead time stabilized \u22481.64 periods based on ~11 concluded arrivals; treat lead time \u22481.64 until new conclude evidence.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_43: on-hand=1964, in-transit=7504. Historical concludes through Period_42 show sustained elevated demand regime beginning Period_2 and stabilized realized lead time \u22481.64 periods (multiple concluded samples, recent arrivals in Period_42 had lead_times 3 and 2 consistent with that). Pipeline is large but arrivals have variable lead times; treat lead time as the recent observed regime rather than the promised 2. I choose L via recent_N to capture the stabilized observed lead-time regime (N=11 samples used historically). For demand forecasting use recent_N=10 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (guidance: use recent_N=10 for forecasts). Sigma similarly uses recent_N=10 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters bias orders toward meeting elevated demand while reflecting realized lead-time behavior to avoid stockouts despite in-transit variability.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_44: on-hand=0, in-transit=11995; recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime starting Period_2 and concluded arrivals imply realized lead times ~1.64 periods (\u224811 concluded samples). Many large in-transit quantities exist so treat shipments as flowing but with L< promised=2. To balance service vs holding cost, set L to recent_N to reflect observed ~1.64-period lead time, use recent_N window for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the elevated demand regime (stable recent mean/volatility). This keeps base-stock responsive to higher demand while capping orders per OR engine rules and avoiding excess holding given high holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime elevated starting Period_2 (sustained high demand; use recent windows for forecasts); observed realized lead time stabilized \u22481.64 periods based on ~11 concluded arrivals (use recent_N for L estimation).

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_45: demand regime has been elevated since Period_2 (recent high means); on-hand=0 but large pipeline (in-transit=13748) from prior orders. Concluded arrivals history shows realized lead times ~1.64 periods (stable); there is no new evidence of lost shipments. To match elevated demand while reflecting observed shorter-than-promised arrivals, set L using a recent-window of concluded lead times (recent_N=11 as prior analyses recommended). Forecast mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=10 demand window (captures current elevated regime while smoothing short-term noise). These choices raise target base-stock to service high demand but rely on pipeline inventory to limit new ordering, balancing profit vs holding cost.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_46: demand has been in an elevated regime since Period_2 (high recent demands) and concluded arrivals show a stable realized lead time ~1.64 periods (\u224811 concluded samples). On-hand=516, in-transit=9869 \u2014 plenty of pipeline but lead-time variability + past delayed arrivals warrant using recent windows. I set L by averaging the most recent 11 observed lead times to reflect the empirically stabilized lead time. I set mu_hat using a recent_N=10 window (captures the elevated-demand regime without overweighting older low-demand periods) scaled by (1+L) as required. I set sigma_hat using recent_N=10 to reflect recent demand volatility. These choices align the OR backend's base-stock and cap computations with the current high-demand regime and observed lead-time behavior, balancing service level (avoid stockouts under high demand) against holding cost given large pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime elevated starting Period_2 (sustained high demand); use recent_N=10 for forecasts. Observed realized lead time stabilized \u22481.64 periods based on ~11 concluded arrivals \u2014 use recent_N window for L estimation until new conclude evidence.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_47 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=13475. Historical concludes show a sustained higher-demand regime beginning Period_2; recent concluded lead times have stabilized around ~1.64 periods (\u224811 samples). Several prior delayed/no-arrival events resolved in later concludes so treat lead time as slightly below promised 2 but use recent evidence. I choose L by averaging the last 11 observed lead times to capture stabilized ~1.64 estimate. For demand forecasting use recent_N=10 (recent-period window) because demand regime shifted up at Period_2 and recent 10-period mean captures the current elevated demand and variance. Use sigma_hat recent_N=10 to reflect recent volatility. These choices align OR base-stock toward servicing the elevated demand while relying on observed shorter-than-promised realized lead times; large in-transit plus conservative recent-based mu/sigma will reduce risk of stockouts while avoiding excessive extra holding.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period_48: on-hand=0, in-transit=14667. Historical concludes show a sustained elevated demand regime starting Period_2; recent concluded lead-times stabilized ~1.64 periods (\u224811 samples). In-transit is large but arrivals are observed with variable lags (some 1\u20133 periods), so use recent-window estimates rather than global defaults. I set L using recent_N=11 to capture the stabilized observed lead-time average from concluded arrivals. For demand forecast (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) I use recent_N=10 per the ongoing guidance to capture the elevated recent demand regime while limiting older low-demand data influence. These choices make the OR backend compute a base-stock tuned to recent higher mean demand and the empirically stabilized lead time, balancing service level (avoid stockouts given long/inconsistent arrivals) against holding costs given the large in-transit volume.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_49: on-hand=0, in-transit=14943, demand regime has been elevated since Period_2 with recent-window higher means. Concluded arrivals history shows stabilized realized lead time \u22481.64 periods (\u224811 samples). To capture the empirically shorter-than-promised lead time, set L using recent_N=11. For demand forecast and volatility use recent_N=10 to reflect the current high-demand regime (recent_N=10 balances responsiveness and sample size). These choices increase target base stock to meet elevated demand while using recent volatility to limit excess holding given high holding cost.

Daily Profit: $10174.00, Daily Holding Cost: $712.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $9462.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_50: demand regime has been elevated since Period_2 (sustained high demands). Recent concluded arrivals imply realized lead time ~1.64 periods (use recent window). On-hand=712 and in-transit=9449 \u2014 strong pipeline but many units will arrive after promised lead time; continue forecasting from recent high-demand regime. Set L using recent_N to capture observed ~1.64 avg lead time (N=11). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=10 to reflect the elevated recent demand mean and volatility across the review+lead period so the OR backend raises base-stock appropriately while the cap limits extreme orders.
