Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. No arrivals or conclude history yet; on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical demand samples available: [112,97,116,138,94] (mean \u2248 111.4). Promised lead time is 4 periods and with no evidence of lead-time shifts or lost shipments I use the promised/default lead time. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7sample mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7sample std using all samples; this leverages available demand history while keeping decisions conservative given zero on-hand/pipeline. This balances service level (covering L+1 periods of expected demand) against holding cost by letting the backend compute the risk buffer via its z* and cap rules.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_2: on-hand=0, in-transit=141; Period_1 order (141) has not concluded (arrived=0) which is expected given promised L=4 and only one period has passed. No concluded arrivals exist yet to infer actual lead time. Demand history (samples: [112,97,116,138,94]) shows no clear recent regime change. To avoid overreacting to an in-flight shipment and because we lack concluded lead-time observations, use defaults: promised lead time for L and population-wide demand statistics for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances service level (covering L+1 periods with base stock) against holding cost without assuming lost or expedited shipments.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date Period_3. On-hand=0, in-transit=279 (orders from P1=141, P2=138 not yet concluded). No concluded arrivals observed => cannot infer actual lead time yet; shipments overdue relative to promised L=4 but absence of conclude messages could indicate long lead time or lost shipments. Demand history (samples=[112,97,116,138,94], mean=111.4, std\u224815.74). I keep L at promised (default) because concluded lead-time evidence is insufficient to change it. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat which scale demand stats by (1+L)=5 to provide the OR engine with a stable base-stock that covers the review+lead period while avoiding overreacting to possible lost shipments; this balances service level (profit>holding) against holding cost given current uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Orders placed in Periods 1 and 2 (141 + 138 = 279) remain in-transit with no concluded arrivals \u2014 potential lost or severely delayed shipments; monitor for conclusion in future periods.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_4 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=497 (sum of orders 141+138+218). Promised lead time=4; no concluded arrivals yet \u2014 but given promised L=4 and concluded messages only through Period_3, these orders are not yet overdue, so keep L as default. Demand history [112,97,116,138,94] shows mean ~111; with no clear changepoint or calendar signal, use population-wide stats. Choose mu_hat default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples (captures required cover for current+L future periods). Choose sigma_hat default so backend computes sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples to reflect observed variability. This balances higher service level (with L=default and full-sample mu) against holding cost given moderate holding penalty.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent periods show large, rising realized demand (Period2=246, Period3=285, Period4=437) vs earlier historical samples; this indicates a demand upshift. Multiple orders placed in Periods 1\u20134 remain in-transit with no concluded arrivals, suggesting lost or severely delayed shipments\u2014so do not trust promised lead time. Set L explicitly higher than promised to hedge against missing arrivals. For demand, use a recent_N=3 forecast (average of last 3 realized demands) to capture the new high-demand regime; apply recent_N=3 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Orders placed in Periods 1\u20134 have produced no arrivals by Period 4 conclude \u2014 probable lost or severely delayed shipments; treat actual lead time as longer than promised (adjust planning accordingly).

Daily Reward (R_t): $282.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_6: On-hand=0, in-transit=1117. History shows one concluded arrival in Period_5: 141 units ordered on Period_1 with lead_time=4, confirming the promised 4-period lead time at least for that shipment. Multiple earlier orders still remain in-transit\u2014monitor for losses\u2014but observed lead-time evidence supports using the calculated average lead time. Set L via calculate to let backend use observed lead-times; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so demand forecasting uses full-sample mean/variance scaled by (1+L)=5 given no strong recent demand regime shift (historical samples: [112,97,116,138,94]). This balances service level (profit>holding cost) while avoiding aggressive extra inventory given remaining pipeline and potential lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods from Period_5 conclude (141 units ordered on Period_1 arrived with lead_time=4); however large remaining in-transit volume (1117) with prior long delays suggests some shipments may still be lost or severely delayed\u2014monitor for further conclusions.

Daily Reward (R_t): $276.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Concluded arrivals from Periods 5\u20136 confirm actual lead time = 4 (Period_5 conclude: Period_1 order arrived, lead_time=4; Period_6 conclude: Period_2 order arrived, lead_time=4). On-hand=0, in-transit=1030 \u2014 large pipeline likely contains outstanding delayed shipments. Given confirmed L=4 and no clear demand regime change in the provided historical samples, use default statistics so OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this keeps service level aligned with profit/holding tradeoff while avoiding overreaction to pipeline uncertainty.

Daily Reward (R_t): $436.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent history shows consistent actual lead_time=4 (conclusions for orders from Periods 1\u20133). Demand has accelerated sharply over the last several periods (recent demands [285,437,448,587,637]); pipeline is large (in-transit=1157) but on-hand=0 so we must plan for (1+L)=5 periods of elevated demand. Set L to calculated (use observed lead times). For demand forecast use recent_N with N=5 to capture the new high-demand regime; use recent_N for sigma to capture recent volatility. These parameters bias orders toward covering the elevated 5-period demand while the OR backend caps order size to limit excessive holding costs given high in-transit.

Carry-over insight: Recent sustained demand increase: last 5-period mean demand = 478.8 (periods with demands 285,437,448,587,637); confirmed actual lead_time = 4 from multiple concluded arrivals; large outstanding in-transit (1157) \u2014 some prior shipments experienced long delays but lead time now appears consistent at 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $544.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent concludes confirm consistent actual lead_time=4 (multiple orders from Periods 1\u20134 arrived with lead_time=4). Demand has clearly shifted up beginning around Period 3; I treat the recent high-demand regime (Periods 3\u20138) as the forecast basis. I set L to calculated average of observed lead times to reflect confirmed 4-period actual lead time. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 (Periods 3\u20138) so the OR engine plans against the elevated mean and volatility, balancing higher service level needs versus holding cost given large in-transit and zero on-hand.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods from multiple concluded arrivals; outstanding in-transit = 1917. Demand has materially increased in recent periods (most recent demands: 448,587,637,776,963) \u2014 detect a regime shift upward. To protect service level while limiting holding cost, keep L at promised (default=4) and set demand forecast and volatility using the most recent regime (recent_N with N=5) so the OR engine builds a base-stock sized to current elevated demand and observed variability.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
On-hand=0, in-transit=2871. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods; recent demand has shifted up sharply (recent 5-period mean \u2248 478.8). Set L using observed lead times. Forecast demand over review+lead using the most recent 5 periods to capture the new high-demand regime; use the same recent 5 for volatility to reflect increased variability. This raises base-stock to meet higher service needs given long lead time while sigma_hat recent_N limits underestimation of risk vs. holding cost.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_12: on-hand=0, in-transit=3548. Historical concludes show consistent actual lead_time=4 (multiple arrivals with lead_time=4). Recent demand has shifted sharply up \u2014 last 5 concluded demands (Periods 7\u201311) = [637,776,963,863,1136], mean=875 and high variance. To cover (1+L) review+lead demand under the new regime while using the OR engine's statistics, set L to default (promised lead time=4) and use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the most recent high-demand regime. This balances higher service level against holding cost given large in-transit volume and confirmed lead time.

Carry-over insight: NEW: Sustained demand increase \u2014 last 5-period mean demand (Periods 7\u201311) = 875, evidence: concluded demands [637,776,963,863,1136]; actual lead_time confirmed = 4 from multiple concluded arrivals; large in-transit (3548) remains, monitor for any lost shipments.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent history (Periods 8\u201312) shows a sustained upward demand regime with demands [776,963,863,1136,1221] (5-period mean = 991.8). Actual lead time has been confirmed at 4 periods repeatedly. On-hand=0, in-transit=3850 \u2014 pipeline is large and will cover multiple review+lead periods, but demand is now much higher so plan using the recent high-demand regime. Set L to default (promised=4, matches observed). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the new high mean demand and recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These parameters orient the OR backend toward a higher base-stock to protect service given confirmed L=4 while relying on recent demand statistics to limit excess holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1628.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead_time = 4. Demand has shifted sharply upward over the most recent periods (Periods 9\u201313). On-hand is 0 and in-transit is large (4324) so expect future arrivals but plan to cover (L+1) periods of elevated demand. I set L to promised/default (4) since concluded history confirms 4. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the new high-demand regime (use last 5 concluded demands) so the OR engine targets inventory for the sustained elevated mean and observed volatility.

Carry-over insight: NEW: Sustained high-demand regime \u2014 last 5 concluded demands (Periods 9\u201313) = [963, 863, 1136, 1221, 1246], mean \u22481065.8; actual lead_time confirmed = 4; large in-transit (4324) remains but continue planning for higher demand.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Context: Period 15. On-hand=0, in-transit=4585. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead_time=4 (multiple concluded arrivals with lead_time=4). Demand has moved to a higher regime: most recent 5 concluded demands (Periods 10\u201314) = [863,1136,1221,1246,1265] (mean \u22481096). Given confirmed LT=4 and sustained higher demand, use promised/default lead time and focus demand forecast on the most recent regime to avoid under-ordering. Choices: L=default to reflect confirmed promised lead time (backend expects promised LT=4 and actual arrived as 4); mu_hat=recent_N with N=5 to capture the new high-demand mean; sigma_hat=recent_N with N=5 to capture recent volatility. This increases pipeline target to cover (1+L) periods of the new demand level and balances service level vs holding cost given high lost-sales risk if understocked.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead_time = 4 from multiple concluded arrivals; new sustained high-demand regime \u2014 last 5 concluded demands (Periods 10\u201314) mean \u22481096; large in-transit backlog (~4585) remains, monitor for any lost shipments.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_16: confirmed actual lead time = 4 from multiple concluded arrivals; recent demand is a sustained high regime (last 5 concluded demands \u2248 [963, 863, 1136, 1221, 1246] \u2192 mean \u2248 1096). On-hand=0, in-transit=4869. With L=4 (review+lead =5 periods) the 5-period demand forecast should reflect the recent high regime. I therefore use L=default (promised lead time =4), mu_hat based on the last 5 periods to capture the new high-demand mean, and sigma_hat based on the last 5 periods to reflect recent volatility. This increases target base-stock to meet service under the higher demand while letting the OR engine cap orders; note in-transit (4869) is slightly below 5\xd7mean (~5480), so orders will top up pipeline to better cover the high-demand regime.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Period 17. Demand has moved to a sustained high regime; last 5 concluded demands (Periods 12\u201316) = [1221, 1246, 1265, 1507, 1547], mean \u2248 1357. Actual lead time repeatedly confirmed = 4 periods. On-hand=0, in-transit=5364 (large backlog). Decision: keep L as promised (default=4) since concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new high-demand regime and its volatility so the OR backend raises base-stock to meet much larger expected demand while limiting excess inventory given high in-transit volume.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime with confirmed actual lead_time=4 (multiple concluded arrivals). On-hand=0, in-transit=5649 (large backlog). To match current demand regime while using reliable lead-time, set L to default (promised 4). Forecast demand across review+lead using recent data: use recent_N (N=5) to capture the high recent mean and avoid diluting with old low-volume samples. Similarly set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=5) to reflect current volatility. This balances higher service level for elevated demand while letting OR backend cap orders to control holding cost given large in-transit volumes.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_19: on-hand=0, in-transit=6174. Multiple concluded arrivals confirm actual lead_time=4 and a sustained high-demand regime. Recent concluded demands (Periods 14\u201318) = [1265,1507,1547,1724,1802], mean \u22481569; demand has increased substantially vs earlier periods. Keep L at promised/default (4) because conclusions consistently show lead_time=4. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the new high-demand regime ((1+L)\xd7recent mean) and recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These parameters prioritize meeting elevated demand (higher base stock) while sigma_hat informs safety stock to balance profit vs holding cost given current backlog and confirmed lead time.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:

Demand has entered a sustained high regime; last 5 concluded demands (Periods 15\u201319) = [1507,1547,1724,1802,2075], mean=1731. To protect service while limiting holding cost given large pipeline, keep L as promised (default) since concluded history matches promised lead time. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to target the current high-demand regime so the OR engine sizes orders for the elevated 5-period demand window and captures recent volatility.

LLM Rationale:
Recent concluded history shows a sustained high-demand regime and consistent actual lead_time=4 (multiple orders with lead_time=4). On-hand=0, in-transit=7748 (large backlog). Demand has jumped well above the initial sample set; I detect a regime change and will base forecast on the most recent 5 periods to reflect current demand. Choose L default to use promised lead time (4) which matches confirmed actual lead time. Set mu_hat recent_N (N=5) and sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the last 5 demands, giving higher base-stock and capture current volatility while letting the backend apply its service-level cap.

Changepoint evidence: demand escalated substantially after Period 18; use recent 5-period stats to capture current regime. Choose L by 'calculate' to reflect observed lead times (all concluded lead_time=4).

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Actual lead time repeatedly confirmed = 4 periods in concluded history. On-hand=0, large in-transit=8560. Recent concluded demands show a sustained high-demand regime; last 5 concluded demands (Periods 20\u201324) mean \u22482213.8. To match current regime and ensure (L+1)-period coverage, keep L = promised (default) and set demand forecasts using recent data. Choose mu_hat recent_N with N=5 to capture the new high-demand mean; choose sigma_hat recent_N with N=5 to reflect recent volatility. This balances service (avoid stockouts given long, consistent lead time and high demand) vs holding cost by using recent regime estimates rather than long-ago low-demand samples.

Carry-over insight: NEW: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed; last 5 concluded demands (Periods 20\u201324) mean \u22482213.8; actual lead_time confirmed = 4; large in-transit backlog = 8560 \u2014 continue planning for elevated demand and monitor in-transit for losses.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent periods show a sustained high-demand regime with confirmed actual lead_time=4 from multiple concluded arrivals. On-hand=0 and large in-transit=9206; prior backlog arrivals are consistent so use recent demand to capture current regime. Set L to default (promised=4). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base (1+L)-period forecast and volatility on the latest high-demand regime (last 5 concluded demands) so OR backend targets service for current elevated demand while limiting excess holding given holding cost=$1/unit.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Period_27 start, on-hand=0, in-transit=9999. Historical concludes show consistent actual lead_time=4 (multiple arrivals with lead_time=4). Recent demand has settled into a sustained high regime: last 5 concluded period demands (Periods 22\u201326) = [2221,2326,2566,2604,2645], mean \u22482472.4. I choose L=default to use promised lead time (4) since actual lead time has been stable at 4 and OR expects promised L. To capture the new high-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the most recent 5 demands, which aligns ordering to current elevated demand and recent volatility while avoiding stale low-demand history. This balances service level (meet very high current demand) against holding cost given large in-transit backlog.

Carry-over insight: NEW: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed \u2014 last 5 concluded demands (Periods 22\u201326) mean \u22482472.4; actual lead_time confirmed = 4; in-transit backlog = 9999 (very large) \u2014 monitor for any lost shipments.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
On-hand=0, in-transit=10279. Actual lead_time consistently observed = 4 periods in concluded history. Recent demand has shifted to a sustained high regime (most recent 5 concluded demands: Periods 23\u201327 = 2326,2566,2604,2645,2890). To capture the new higher mean and recent volatility while honoring confirmed lead time, use default lead time (promised=4) and compute mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent 5 samples so the OR backend sizes base-stock to meet current elevated demand without over-relying on older low-demand data. This balances service level against holding cost given large pipeline (some prior shipments showed delays but recent arrivals are consistent at L=4).

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent concluded history shows actual lead_time=4 consistently and a sustained high-demand regime. Last 5 concluded demands (Periods 24\u201328) = [2566,2604,2645,2890,2643], mean \u22482669.6, so I use a recent-5 demand estimate to capture the elevated demand. On-hand=0 and in-transit=10847 (large backlog) \u2014 using recent demand prevents understocking while L=default (promised=4, matches observed) keeps pipeline coverage aligned with actual arrivals. sigma_hat uses recent-5 to capture current volatility.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Choose L=default (promised 4) because concluded history confirms lead_time=4; mu_hat recent_N N=5 to size (1+L)\xd7recent mean and raise service level for the sustained high demand; sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. This raises the base-stock to meet the elevated demand given confirmed lead time while relying on recent volatility to avoid extreme overstock given holding cost.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 31: on-hand=0, in-transit=10976. Historical conclude history shows consistent actual lead_time=4 (multiple confirmed arrivals) and a sustained high-demand regime in recent periods. Recent 5 concluded demands (Periods 26\u201330) = [2645,2890,2643,2814,2873], indicating demand remains elevated. Use promised/default lead time (4) since actual lead_time has been stable at 4. Set demand forecast using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current high-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets service for the new demand level while capping orders via its cap formula. This balances service (avoiding stockouts) against holding cost given the very large in-transit backlog that may include delayed/lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead_time = 4 from multiple concluded arrivals; recent sustained high-demand regime (Periods 26\u201330 mean \u22482773 for single-period demand) and large in-transit backlog = 10976 \u2014 monitor for lost shipments.

LLM Rationale:
Context: Period_32. On-hand=0, in-transit=11405. Historical conclues show stable actual lead_time=4 and a clear sustained high-demand regime \u2014 last 5 concluded single-period demands (Periods 27\u201331) = [2890,2643,2814,2873,3046], mean \u22482853.2. Many prior shipments experienced delays but recent arrivals confirm consistent 4-period lead time. Reconcile: pipeline (11405) covers multiple future periods but some earlier shipments were delayed; monitor for lost shipments. Decision: keep L as promised (4) since conclusions confirm L=4; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the new high-demand regime so the OR backend will size base-stock to meet elevated demand while capping orders via its cap to limit over-ordering given large pipeline.

Because demand is now much larger than the original small-sample prior, use recent_N=5 to set demand forecast and volatility so the OR engine targets the appropriate elevated base-stock. Keep L as promised (default=4) since concluded history matches promised lead time. This balances service (reduce stockouts given high demand) while the large in-transit backlog will be consumed over coming periods; recent_N methods avoid overreacting to older low-demand samples and better tune safety stock for current variance.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 34: on-hand=0, in-transit=11913, profit=$2/unit, holding=$1/unit. Historical concludes show consistent actual lead_time=4. Recent demand has climbed into a very-high regime: last 5 concluded single-period demands (Periods 29\u201333) = [2814,2873,3046,3005,3391], mean\u22483025.8. I set L=default to use the promised lead time (consistent with observed actual=4). For mu_hat I choose recent_N (N=5) to capture the current very-high-demand regime ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 samples). For sigma_hat I choose recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices prioritize service (meet very high near-term demand) while letting the backend cap orders via its cap formula to limit over-ordering given the very large in-transit backlog.

Choice: keep L as promised (default) since concluded history matches promised lead time=4. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes demand and volatility using the most recent high-demand regime (captures current elevated mean and variance) and scales by (1+L). This prioritizes service for the new demand level while the large pipeline limits aggressive additional ordering, balancing profit vs holding cost.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 36. On-hand=0, in-transit=12933. Actual lead time has been consistently 4 periods in concluded history; large sustained rise in demand over recent periods (periods 31\u201335 single-period demands: 3046,3005,3391,3368,3282). I set L=default to use promised lead time (promised=4, matches observed). For mu_hat I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the new very-high-demand regime ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 concluded single-period demands). For sigma_hat I use recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices push the backend base-stock to cover (L+1) periods of the elevated demand while sigma is estimated from the same recent window to avoid underestimating safety stock given the large in-transit backlog.

Carry-over insight: NEW: Sustained very-high-demand regime \u2014 last 5 concluded single-period demands (Periods 31\u201335) mean = 3218.4; actual lead_time confirmed = 4; large in-transit backlog = 12933 (monitor for any lost shipments).

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent concluded history shows a sustained very-high-demand regime (last 5 concluded single-period demands: Periods 32\u201336 = [3005,3391,3368,3282,3448], mean \u22483298.8). Actual lead time has been consistently observed = 4 periods. On-hand=0, large in-transit (~13265) but arrivals follow L=4. To match OR engine expectations I use promised/default lead time and set demand/volatility based on the most recent 5-period regime so forecasts reflect the elevated demand while avoiding overreaction to older low-demand samples. This balances service (higher mu_hat to cover demand over review+lead) against holding cost by using recent samples rather than the full historical mean.

Daily Reward (R_t): $6136.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Observations: on-hand=0, in-transit=13595, Period 37 conclude shows demand=3748 and historical concluded lead_time repeatedly = 4. Recent 5-period concluded demands (Periods 33\u201337) = [3391,3368,3282,3448,3748], mean \u2248 3447.4, indicating a sustained very-high-demand regime. Many earlier shipments experienced long delays but lead time now consistently observed = 4; large outstanding pipeline remains. Decision logic: keep L as promised (default) since actual lead_time confirmed = 4 repeatedly; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current high-demand regime and recent volatility so the OR backend computes a base-stock that reflects the 5-period demand \xd7 (1+L). This balances service level (respond to elevated demand) vs. holding cost by relying on recent demand statistics rather than long-ago low-demand samples. 

Carry-over insight: NEW: Recent sustained very-high-demand regime \u2014 last 5 concluded demands (Periods 33\u201337) mean \u22483447.4; actual lead_time confirmed = 4; large in-transit backlog = 13595 (monitor for any lost shipments).

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Period 39, on-hand=0, in-transit=13940, profit=2, holding=1. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead_time=4. Demand has been in a sustained very-high regime; using the most recent 5 concluded-period demands captures current demand level and variability. Reconcile: large in-transit backlog but on-hand=0 so plan to target (1+L)\xd7recent mean to align base stock with latest regime while sigma based on recent volatility. Choices: L=default (trusted promised lead time 4 which matches observed conclusions), mu_hat=recent_N with N=5 to forecast across review+lead using latest high-demand regime, sigma_hat=recent_N with N=5 to reflect recent demand volatility. These parameters bias the OR engine toward meeting the current very-high demand while keeping holding costs grounded in recent variability.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
On-hand=0, in-transit=14478. Concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead_time=4 (multiple orders with lead_time=4). Recent demand has shifted to a sustained very-high regime: last 5 concluded single-period demands (Periods 35\u201339) = [3282,3448,3748,3929,4212], mean \u22483723.8. To cover review+lead demand and reflect the new regime, set L by calculating observed lead times (captures confirmed L=4). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to anchor the OR base-stock to the current very-high demand and recent volatility while avoiding stale low-demand samples. This prioritizes service (high profit relative to holding cost) while acknowledging large in-transit backlog that may include delayed/lost shipments.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Period 47. On-hand=0, in-transit=16809 (large backlog). Recent concluded arrivals repeatedly confirm actual lead_time = 4. Demand has been in a sustained very-high regime; last 5 concluded single-period demands (Periods 42\u201346) = [4040,3950,4444,4364,4530], average \u22484265.6. To match confirmed L=4 and rapidly elevated demand while keeping pipeline cover for (1+L) periods, set L to promised/default (4), and use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets the current high-demand regime and preserves service while avoiding excessive extra holding beyond the large existing in-transit backlog.

Daily Reward (R_t): $7926.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent concluded history shows a sustained very-high demand regime and consistent actual lead_time=4 (multiple concluded arrivals with lead_time=4). On-hand=0 and in-transit=17533 (large backlog) \u2014 treat supplier lead time as the promised default and size orders to cover the elevated short-term demand. I use recent_N=5 for demand mean and volatility to capture the current very-high-demand regime (most relevant for setting (1+L) demand across review+lead). This balances service (avoid stockouts given zero on-hand and huge in-transit uncertainty) against holding cost by using short-window estimates rather than the original small-sample historic data.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_49 decision: confirmed stable actual lead_time=4 (multiple concluded arrivals). Recent demand is in a sustained very-high regime \u2014 last 5 concluded single-period demands (Periods 44\u201348) = [4444,4364,4530,4595,4776], mean \u22484541.8. On-hand=0, in-transit=18163 (large backlog). To match current regime and the OR engine's (1+L) aggregation, I set L=default (promised 4). I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the current very-high demand level over the lead+review horizon. I use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices prioritize service (higher base stock) given high demand and large pipeline while letting the OR engine cap orders to avoid runaway placement given holding cost.

Carry-over insight: NEW: Sustained very-high-demand \u2014 last 5 concluded single-period demands (Periods 44\u201348) mean \u22484541.8; large in-transit backlog = 18163 (monitor for lost shipments).

Daily Reward (R_t): $9190.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_50: on-hand=0, in-transit=18266; profit=$2, holding=$1. Concluded history shows consistent actual lead_time=4 over many periods and a sustained very-high demand regime (recent single-period demands: Periods 45\u201349 = 4364, 4530, 4595, 4776, 5087). Large in-transit backlog but recent arrivals confirm shipments are generally arriving with 4-period lead time. I therefore use the promised/default lead time and set demand parameters using a recent-5 sample to capture the current very-high regime and recent volatility so the OR engine orders to cover (1+L) periods of elevated demand while balancing service level vs holding cost.
