Promised lead time (shown to LLM): 4 periods (1 period = 14 days)
Note: Actual lead times in CSV may differ and will be inferred by LLM from arrivals.
Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start: no on-hand or in-transit inventory, no concluded arrivals to infer actual lead time. Use promised lead time (default). Historical demand samples [112,97,116,138,94] give stable mean; apply default formulas so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This keeps OR backend anchored to historical demand while the promised L=4 addresses pipeline coverage for the review+lead period and balances service level vs holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
No concluded arrivals observed yet (Period 1 order of 141 shows arrived=0 in Period 1 conclude as expected given promised lead time). No evidence to change promised lead time, and no clear demand regime shift in the five-sample history. Use default lead time (promised=4) and default demand estimates so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This keeps supply covering the L+1 review horizon while avoiding premature manual adjustments; monitor future conclude messages for late or lost arrivals and revise if shipments fail to conclude by the promised window.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3: on-hand=0, in-transit=279 (matches orders 141+138 from Periods 1-2) and no concluded arrivals observed yet (no arrived messages), so actual lead time remains uncertain and shipments may be delayed or simply follow promised lead time. Historical demand samples = [112,97,116,138,94] (mean=111.4). To avoid overreacting to missing conclude messages and to let the OR engine use its statistical pipeline, use default promised lead time and default demand/volatility aggregation across all samples so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This balances service level (use full historical demand) against holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory.

Carry-over insight: No concluded arrivals yet for orders placed in Periods 1-2; in-transit=279 equals those orders\u2192possible lead-time delay or normal long lead time. Monitor for conclude messages to confirm actual L; do not assume lost shipments yet.

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent conclude messages show no arrivals for orders placed in Periods 1-3 while in-transit=497 (all outstanding). Demand in the most recent periods is elevated (Period1=91, Period2=246, Period3=285) vs older historical samples, indicating a regime shift to higher demand. Because shipments promised L=4 have not concluded for multiple periods, I treat lead time as longer than promised and explicitly increase L to avoid understocking. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3 periods to capture the new higher mean and volatility so the OR engine will target a larger pipeline to cover (1+L) periods of elevated demand.

Carry-over insight: No concluded arrivals for orders placed in Periods 1-3 while in-transit remains large (497 units) -> likely longer-than-promised lead time; recent demand spike confirmed by Period2=246 and Period3=285, signaling a sustained higher-demand regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Observed no concluded arrivals for orders placed in Periods 1-4 and in-transit=874 remains large \u2192 evidence of shipments delayed beyond promised L=4; to avoid stockouts I explicitly lengthen lead time. Recent periods show a clear upward demand regime (Period2=246, Period3=285, Period4=437); use recent_N=3 for demand estimates (most recent 3 demands) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the new higher mean and volatility. These settings raise target base-stock to prioritize service while acknowledging higher holding cost via conservative lead-time inflation.

Carry-over insight: Likely prolonged lead-time: orders placed in Periods 1\u20134 have not concluded and in-transit rose to 874 \u2192 suggest actual lead time > promised 4; Recent sustained demand increase starting Period2: demands 246,285,437 \u2192 new higher-demand regime (use recent 3 for forecasts).

Daily Reward (R_t): $282.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent periods show a sustained demand jump starting Period 2 (demands 246,285,437,448) vs earlier low baseline. One concluded arrival (Period 5) confirms an observed lead time of 4 periods (order on Period 1 arrived with W=4). Given the sustained higher-demand regime (Periods 2\u20135), use recent demand samples to forecast; use observed lead-time average for L. This raises mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect recent higher mean and volatility so the OR backend increases base-stock to cover the (1+L) review+lead window while recognizing holding cost via the capped order cap.

Carry-over insight: New sustained higher-demand regime beginning Period 2: recent demands [246,285,437,448] (Periods 2\u20135) -> use recent sample-based forecasts; observed lead time confirmed = 4 (Period1 order arrived in Period5, W=4).

Daily Reward (R_t): $276.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Observed concluded lead times: Period1 order arrived in Period5 (W=4), Period2 order arrived in Period6 (W=4) \u2192 actual lead time = 4. Recent sustained demand regime began Period2: recent demands (Periods2\u20136) = [246,285,437,448,587] (elevated vs original baseline). On-hand=0, in-transit=1609 covers future demand but pipeline needs replenishment sized to higher recent mean over lead+review. Set L to calculated average of observed lead times to reflect confirmed W=4. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so OR backend forecasts using the latest high-demand regime (N=5 = Periods2\u20136). These params increase service level to avoid stockouts given high demand while sigma based on recent volatility prevents overordering beyond cap.

Carry-over insight: New sustained higher-demand regime starting Period2 confirmed by demands Periods2\u20136 = [246,285,437,448,587]; treat recent 5 samples for forecasts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $436.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Observed arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 (Period1\u2192Period5, Period2\u2192Period6, Period3\u2192Period7 all W=4). Demand shifted up starting Period2; recent demands (Periods2\u20137) = [246,285,437,448,587,637], so use recent-sample based forecast over that regime. Set L via calculate to reflect observed lead time; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 to capture the new higher-demand mean and volatility. This balances higher service level (captures surge) while keeping holding cost considered via OR engine's z*/cap logic.

Carry-over insight: New sustained higher-demand regime beginning Period2 confirmed by demands Periods2\u20137 = [246,285,437,448,587,637]; actual lead time confirmed = 4 (Period1 order arrived in Period5, W=4).

Daily Reward (R_t): $754.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Actual lead time confirmed = 4 (orders from Periods 1\u20134 concluded with W=4). Demand shifted to a sustained higher regime beginning Period 2 (consecutive demands: 246,285,437,448,587,637,776). Use recent-sample forecasting to reflect this higher mean/volatility: apply recent_N=6 (most recent 6 demands Periods 3\u20138 = [285,437,448,587,637,776]) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so (1+L) scaling captures review+lead demand. This balances higher service level needs vs holding cost by sizing base-stock to recent elevated demand while using observed lead time for L.

Carry-over insight: Sustained higher-demand regime beginning Period 2 supported by demands Periods2\u20138 = [246,285,437,448,587,637,776]; actual lead time consistently 4 (observed W=4 for orders from Periods1\u20134).

Daily Reward (R_t): $978.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: On-hand=0, in-transit=2299; recent demands show a sustained higher-demand regime beginning Period2 (large successive spikes). Concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 (orders from Periods1\u20134 arrived with W=4). Evidence: recent demands (Periods5\u20139) = [448,587,637,776,963] indicate elevated mean and variance. Decision: keep L as promised (default) since actual lead time confirmed = 4; compute demand forecast using recent_N (N=5) to capture the new higher-demand regime; compute sigma using recent_N (N=5) to reflect increased volatility. This raises base_stock to satisfy (1+L) periods of elevated demand while sigma_hat based on recent volatility keeps safety stock responsive to the larger demand swings.

Carry-over insight: Sustained higher-demand regime beginning Period2 confirmed; recent sample window (Periods5\u20139) shows elevated mean and volatility; actual lead time consistently 4 (observed W=4 for concluded arrivals).

Concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 4 (orders from Periods1\u20136 concluded with W=4). I set L=calculate to reflect observed lead times. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new higher-demand regime using the last 5 demand samples (Periods6\u201310), providing the OR backend with an elevated mean and volatility so orders cover the (1+L) review+lead horizon while avoiding excessive holding given high holding cost relative to profit.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1054.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Demand has been in a sustained higher regime since Period 2 (recent demands Periods7\u201311 = [637,776,963,863,1136]). Lead time has been consistently observed = 4 (all concluded arrivals show W=4). On-hand=0, in-transit=3274 covers multiple periods of expected demand but we still target a recent-sample forecast to capture elevated mean and volatility. Therefore: set L via calculate to use observed lead times (captures confirmed L=4); set mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 to base (1+L)\xd7mean on the most recent 5 demands; set sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to reflect recent volatility. This balances higher service needs (due to high recent demand) against holding cost by using recent demand stats rather than long-run low-demand samples.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Demand has shifted to a sustained higher regime since Period 2 (recent large demands and concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4). In-transit is large (4027) with on-hand 0 so pipeline must be included. I choose L=default to use promised lead time (4) since concluded arrivals consistently show W=4. For forecasting I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the elevated mean and volatility from the most recent stable high-demand window, keeping orders responsive to current regime while the OR backend computes base_stock and cap accordingly.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Observed lead time consistently 4 periods in concluded arrivals. Demand has shifted to a sustained higher regime; recent five demands (Periods 9\u201313 = 963,863,1136,1221,1246) show elevated mean and volatility. On-hand=0, large pipeline=4324 covers multiple periods but future arrivals are delayed by lead time. Use promised/default L=4 to match confirmed observations and reduce mismatch risk. Forecast (mu_hat,sigma_hat) use recent_N with N=5 to capture the current high-demand regime and increased variability so the OR backend raises base-stock and cap appropriately.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime since Period 2 with large, consistent demands in recent periods (Periods10\u201314 demands = [863,1136,1221,1246,1265]). Concluded arrivals consistently show lead time W=4 for multiple orders, so actual lead time = 4. To stay responsive to the higher-demand regime while reflecting observed lead time, I set L via calculate (average observed W=4) and use recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility from the most recent elevated samples. This emphasizes service (meeting very large current demand) while letting the OR engine compute safety stock from recent volatility to balance holding cost.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 16: on-hand=0, in-transit=4869. Historical concludes show consistent actual lead time = 4 (orders from Periods1\u201311 concluded with W=4). Demand has shifted to a sustained higher regime since Period2 with very recent high demands (Periods11\u201315: 1136,1221,1246,1265,1507). I keep L at the promised/default (4) because concluded history matches promised lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the elevated mean from the latest five periods and keep service for the new regime. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N N=5 to reflect recent higher volatility. This balances higher service needs (profit>holding) while limiting excess holding given zero on-hand and large in-transit pipeline.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Actual lead time has been consistently observed = 4 (concluded arrivals show W=4). Demand shows a sustained higher regime beginning Period 2 with large recent demands; use a recent-window forecast to capture elevated mean/volatility. Set L=default to keep promised lead time (matches observed). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent elevated demand samples and higher variance, which helps the OR engine raise base stock and cap to avoid stockouts while acknowledging higher holding cost.

Demand has shifted to a sustained higher regime beginning Period2; recent high demands (Periods13\u201317 = [1246,1265,1507,1547,1724]) justify using a recent window. Choose L=default to trust promised lead time (4) since concludes confirm it. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and uncertainty based on the most recent high-demand regime, balancing service level against holding cost while the large in-transit pipeline is consumed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2532.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Demand has settled into a sustained higher-demand regime (large demands since Period 2). Recent realized lead time is consistently 4 periods (multiple concluded arrivals show W=4). On-hand=0, in-transit=6216 (pipeline large). Use promised lead time (default=4) and base forecasts using the most recent 5 demand samples to capture current elevated mean and volatility (Periods14\u201318 demand = [1265,1507,1547,1724,1802]). This balances service (meet high demand) versus holding cost by aligning mu_hat and sigma_hat to the recent high-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained higher-demand regime beginning Period2; use recent sample-based forecasts. Actual lead time confirmed = 4 (observed W=4 for multiple concluded arrivals).

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Recent periods show a sustained high-demand regime (Periods16\u201320 demands = 1547,1724,1802,2075,1973). In-transit is large (7343) and past concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4. To align OR inputs with current regime I keep L at the promised/default (4) and use recent_N (N=5) for demand mean and volatility so mu_hat/sigma_hat reflect the elevated recent mean and higher variance; this balances service level (covering L+1=5 periods of high demand) against holding costs given already-large pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Sustained higher-demand regime confirmed using recent periods16\u201320 (demands 1547,1724,1802,2075,1973); actual lead time confirmed = 4 based on multiple concluded arrivals (orders from Periods1\u201316 concluded with W=4).

I set L to default (promised 4) because actual lead time has been consistently 4 and the backend expects promised L. To capture the sustained higher-demand regime, I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the most recent 5 high-demand samples, keeping pipeline targets aligned with current demand and limiting excess holding given high holding cost.

I set L=default to use the promised lead time (4) because concluded arrivals consistently confirm it. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)-period demand and variability using the most recent high-demand regime, balancing service level against holding cost in the current high-demand environment.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
On-hand=0, in-transit=9248. Historical concludes show consistent actual lead time = 4 (multiple orders: e.g. Period1\u2192arrived Period5, Period2\u2192Period6, etc.). Demand has been in a sustained higher regime since Period2; recent demands (Periods21\u201325) = [1983,2221,2326,2566,2604], so use a recent-window forecast to capture elevated mean and volatility. Choose L=default (use promised 4) since actual lead time repeatedly confirmed as 4 in concluded history. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to align base-stock with the most recent high-demand behavior and increased volatility, balancing service level against holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

Carry-over insight: Sustained higher-demand regime beginning Period2 confirmed; recent window Periods21\u201325 mean elevated (1983,2221,2326,2566,2604). Actual lead time confirmed = 4 based on multiple concluded arrivals (e.g. orders from Periods1\u201321 concluding with W=4).

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Demand has been in a sustained higher regime since Period 2 with recent high demands (Periods 23\u201327 = [2326,2566,2604,2645,2890]). Lead time has consistently observed W=4 for many concluded arrivals, so infer actual L=4. To match the recent regime, set mu_hat using recent 5 samples (captures elevated mean over the last 5 periods). Use sigma_hat from the same recent 5 to capture current volatility. These choices bias orders toward the higher short-term demand while reflecting confirmed lead time, reducing stockouts given large in-transit volume and zero on-hand.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Period 29. On-hand=0, in-transit=10847 (large pipeline). Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods. Demand has settled into a sustained high regime; recent demands (Periods24\u201328) = [2566,2604,2645,2890,2643] with elevated mean and volatility. Reconciliation: large in-transit stock already covers multiple future periods given L=4 but arrivals occur after decision; maintain promised L. Parameter choices: set L to default (promised=4) because concluded history repeatedly confirms W=4; use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new high-demand regime and recent volatility (window = Periods24\u201328). This prioritizes service (profit > holding cost) while the OR backend will compute base_stock and cap using recent mean/variance to avoid underordering in the high-demand regime.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period_30: On-hand=0, in-transit=10847. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 (orders from Periods 1\u201325 concluded with W=4). Demand has been in a sustained higher regime; recent window (Periods 25\u201329 demands = [2604,2645,2890,2643,2814]) captures current mean and volatility. Use promised lead time (default) since actual L=4 confirmed. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to align forecasts to the elevated, stable demand regime and avoid diluting with older low-demand samples; this balances service (high profit) against holding cost by targeting current demand plus safety derived from recent volatility.

Demand has been in a sustained higher regime; recent demands (Periods 26\u201330) = [2645,2890,2643,2814,2873]. Choose L=default to use promised lead time (4) since actual L confirmed=4. Use recent_N N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so forecasts reflect the elevated recent mean and volatility (covers the review+lead demand window).

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 32: on-hand=0, large in-transit=11396, recent history shows sustained high-demand regime since Period2 with confirmed actual lead time = 4 (multiple concluded arrivals). In-transit already covers several future periods but demand remains elevated (recent 5 demands: Periods27\u201331 = [2890,2643,2814,2873,3046]). I keep L at default (promised 4, which matches observed arrivals) and use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend forecasts using the most recent high-demand regime and captures elevated mean and volatility. This balances service (high demand) against holding cost by sizing base stock to recent demand and variability while relying on existing large pipeline to limit new ordering aggressiveness.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Demand has been in a sustained higher regime since Period 2 (recent demands remain elevated). Actual lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods (multiple concluded arrivals). On-hand=0, in-transit=11469 provides large pipeline but arrivals will be visible with 1-period observation lag. To match observed regime and keep service while controlling holdings, use promised/default lead time (L=default) and set demand forecast and volatility from the most recent 5 realized demands to capture the current elevated mean and variance (mu_hat: recent_N N=5, sigma_hat: recent_N N=5). This yields (1+L)-scaled recent averages and std devs so the OR backend orders to cover the higher demand while the capped policy limits overly large single-period orders.

Demand has been in a sustained higher regime; recent five demands (Periods 31\u201335) = [3046, 3005, 3391, 3368, 3282]. I set L to default (promised lead time) because concluded history confirms L=4 and shipments are arriving reliably. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand regime (most recent 5 samples) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and elevated volatility, balancing service level against holding cost given large in-transit inventory.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
On-hand=0, large in-transit=13,256. Historical concludes show a sustained higher-demand regime since Period2; recent demands (Periods32\u201336 = [3005,3391,3368,3282,3448]) remain elevated. Actual lead time consistently observed = 4. Use promised lead time (default). Forecast demand across review+lead using recent 5 samples to capture current regime mean; use recent 5 for volatility to reflect elevated variance. This balances service (meet high demand) vs holding cost by sizing orders to recent realized demand rather than long-ago low samples.

Carry-over insight: Sustained higher-demand regime beginning Period2 confirmed by recent windows; actual lead time confirmed = 4 based on multiple concluded arrivals.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_38: on-hand=0, in-transit=13595. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 (orders from many periods concluded with W=4). Recent demand window (Periods 33\u201337 = [3391,3368,3282,3448,3748]) shows a sustained high-demand regime; use this recent window to capture elevated mean and volatility. Using recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat aligns the base-stock target to current demand while avoiding overreaction to single-period spikes; keeping L as default (promised) is appropriate since concluded history confirms L=4. This preserves service (high fill) given large pipeline while letting OR backend cap orders to limit holding costs.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Period 39. On-hand=0, in-transit=13940. Historical concludes show a consistent actual lead time of 4 periods and a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 2; recent demands (Periods 34\u201338) = [3368, 3282, 3448, 3748, 3929]. I set L=calculate to use observed lead times (consistent W=4). For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new high-demand regime and elevated volatility from the last five periods. These parameters steer the OR backend toward a larger base-stock that covers the (1+L)-period demand in the current high-demand regime while reflecting higher sigma for safety stock; this balances service level against holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Context: Period 40. On-hand=0, in-transit=14478. Historical concludes show actual lead time consistently 4 periods (orders from Periods 1\u201335 concluded with W=4). Demand is in a sustained higher regime; recent demands (Periods 35\u201339) = [3282,3448,3748,3929,4212]. Reconciliation: large in-transit (14478) roughly covers multiple future periods but on-hand is zero so shortages occur each period until arrivals. Decision: keep L at promised (default) because concluded history confirms L=4. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new higher-demand regime and elevated volatility (use the most recent 5 demand samples to set mean and std across review+lead period). This focuses service on current high demand while avoiding overstating older low-demand data.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_41: demand has been in a sustained high regime since Period_2. Actual lead time repeatedly observed = 4 (confirmed across many concluded arrivals). On-hand=0, in-transit=15488 (large pipeline covering multiple periods). To match recent regime and keep service with controlled holding cost, use promised lead time and base forecasts from the most recent 5 demand samples (Periods36\u201340) for both mean and volatility. This targets the elevated mean/variance while relying on confirmed L=4 so OR backend computes base-stock appropriate to current high-demand regime.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Observed actual lead time has been consistently 4 periods (multiple concluded arrivals show W=4). Demand is in a sustained higher regime since Period 2 with recent growth \u2014 use a short recent window to capture current elevated mean and volatility. On-hand=0 and large in-transit (16690) but pipeline will be counted by backend; choose L=default to trust promised lead time (matches observed). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the latest demand level and variability so the OR engine raises the base stock and cap appropriately to meet high demand while controlling holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Sustained higher-demand regime beginning Period2 confirmed; recent 5-period window best represents current demand. Actual lead time stable at 4 periods (multiple concluded arrivals show W=4).

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Current context: Period 44. On-hand=55, in-transit=16997. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4; demand has been in a sustained higher regime (recent periods show elevated demand). Reconcile: large in-transit + small on-hand means pipeline covers multiple future periods but we must align forecasts to recent high demand to avoid stockouts when pipeline shifts. Choices: L set to default (promised 4) because concluded history confirms actual L=4; mu_hat use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current high-demand regime using the most representative recent window; sigma_hat use recent_N (N=5) to reflect elevated volatility in the same recent window. These parameters bias the OR backend toward higher base-stock to preserve service level under elevated demand while letting the OR cap limit excessive single-period orders to control holding cost.

I select L by averaging observed lead times to reflect confirmed actual L=4, and use a recent-5 window for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility from the current high-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Sustained higher-demand regime confirmed (start Period2); recent 5-period window (Periods41\u201345) best represents current demand; actual lead time stable at 4 periods (multiple concluded arrivals).

I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 so the OR engine forecasts using the most-representative high-demand window; (1+L)*mean(5)=5*4265.6=21328 which exceeds current in-transit (16831) so orders will top up pipeline to cover review+lead demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $9190.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: demand has been in a sustained high regime; recent 5-period demands (Periods45\u201349 = 4364, 4530, 4595, 4776, 5087) are representative. Actual lead time has been consistently observed = 4 periods. Decision: keep L as promised (default) since actual L=4 matches promised; use recent 5-sample forecast for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the elevated mean and volatility and ensure pipeline covers (1+L) periods of high demand while avoiding excessive holding given $1/unit holding cost vs $2/unit profit.
