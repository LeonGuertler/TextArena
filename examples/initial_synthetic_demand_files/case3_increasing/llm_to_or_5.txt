Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. No concluded arrivals or overdue shipments observed; on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Use promised lead time and historical demand (5 samples: mean\u2248111.4, std\u224815.8) with default calculations to let OR backend compute base-stock and caps. This keeps parameters grounded in full-sample statistics until evidence of lead-time shifts or demand regime changes appears.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_2. Recent demand history (samples=[112,97,116,138,94]) shows mean ~111. Four facts: on-hand=0, in-transit=141 (ordered P1) but Period1 conclude arrived=0 so no confirmed arrival yet; promised lead time=2 (order placed P1 should arrive during Period3). No clear changepoint in demand or lead time observed. Use default promised lead time to let backend assume L=2; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given no new signal and a full in-transit pipeline.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3: on-hand=0, in-transit=279. Two recent orders (Period 1:141, Period 2:138) have not concluded/arrived \u2014 evidence of delayed shipments but no concluded lead-time observations yet. I keep L as default (promised 2) because there are no observed lead-time values to calculate an empirical lead time. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to default so the OR backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all historical samples (uses full demand history [112,97,116,138,94]) \u2014 a stable baseline given limited reliable lead-time info. This balances service level against holding cost while we wait for concluded arrivals to revise lead-time or demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Delayed/unconcluded shipments: orders placed in Period 1 (141) and Period 2 (138) remain unarrived by their conclude messages \u2014 possible persistent delay or lost shipments; no concluded lead-time observed yet.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_4: demand history shows increasing recent demand (samples mean=111.4, recent demands 91,246,285 indicate volatility and possible upward shift). On-hand=0, in-transit=424 but none of the orders placed in Periods 1-3 have concluded (arrived=0 each conclude) \u2014 suggests shipments are delayed or lost. To protect service given missing/uncertain arrivals, I extend the assumed lead time to L=4 (explicit) so the backend plans for a longer replenishment window. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples (this scales demand and variability with the longer lead time). This conservative L reduces stockout risk given unobserved arrivals while allowing the OR engine's capped ordering to limit extreme over-ordering.

Carry-over insight: Persistent missing arrivals for orders placed in Periods 1-3: Period 1 ordered=141 arrived=0; Period 2 ordered=138 arrived=0; Period 3 ordered=145 arrived=0 \u2014 indicates a sustained delay or lost shipments; treat lead time as longer until concludes resume.

Daily Reward (R_t): $848.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_5: recent concluded arrivals reveal actual lead times for orders placed in Periods 1-3 were 3,2,1 (average 2). On-hand=0, in-transit=272 (these arrivals already concluded into Period_4). Demand has jumped sharply in recent periods (Period1-4 demands = 91,246,285,437) indicating a new high-demand regime. I set L by 'calculate' to reflect observed lead-time history rather than promised-only. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) I use recent_N with N=4 to capture the elevated mean and higher variance from the last 4 demand observations, so the OR engine will target a larger base stock to avoid stockouts while capping orders per its cap rule.

Carry-over insight: Observed actual lead times from concluded arrivals: Period1\u21923, Period2\u21922, Period3\u21921 => average lead time=2 (evidence: Period_4 conclude arrivals). Recent demand regime increased: recent demands [91,246,285,437] show elevated mean/variance.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=771. Concluded arrivals in Period 4 reveal observed lead times 3,2,1 (avg=2); recent demand sequence (Periods1-5): [91,246,285,437,448] shows a clear upward regime with high variance. To cover review+lead demand and reflect the recent spike, set L by calculating observed average lead time; set demand forecast and volatility using the most recent 5 periods to capture the new mean/variance.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Context: Period 7. On-hand=184, in-transit=545. Observed concluded lead times = [3,2,1,2,1] (Periods 4 and 6 conclude), average \u22481.8 \u2192 actual lead time \u22482. Recent demand regime elevated (recent periods show large growth). I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the average of observed lead times. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the recent high-demand regime and avoid diluting with older low-demand samples; same N for sigma to reflect increased variance. These parameters raise base-stock to cover the higher short-term demand while the calculated L accounts for observed lead-time variability and delayed arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Observed concluded lead times = 3,2,1,2,1 \u2192 average \u22481.8 (treat as ~2); Recent demand regime increased markedly (last 5 demands elevated vs earlier history).

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_8: recent concluded arrivals imply average lead time \u22482 periods (observed leads: 3,2,1,2,1 \u2192 mean~1.8). Demand has shifted up sharply in recent periods (recent demands high: 437,448,587,637...). To protect service with the observed longer effective lead time and elevated demand, set L by calculating observed lead times; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the new high-demand regime for the review+lead period.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 9: recent demand regime is markedly higher (recent demands: Period4\u20138 = 437,448,587,637,776). On-hand=0, in-transit=1871 (large pipeline from prior orders). Concluded lead-time observations exist (varied 3,2,1,2,1 \u2192 avg \u22482), so set L via calculate to use observed lead-time average. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current elevated demand mean and volatility from the last 5 periods. These parameters bias orders toward covering the higher, recent demand while letting the OR backend cap orders to limit overstock given the large in-transit inventory.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period_10: recent demand has been markedly elevated (recent demands ~ 448,587,637,776,963). On-hand=0, in-transit=2208 \u2014 large pipeline from prior orders. Observed concluded lead times = [3,2,1,2,1] (Periods 4&6 concludes), average \u22481.8 \u2192 treat lead time as ~2 but let backend compute exact average from observations. To capture the recent higher-demand regime, set demand forecast using the last 5 periods. Volatility also driven by recent high variance, so estimate sigma from the same recent 5 samples. These choices balance service (higher mu_hat to meet surging demand) against holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_11 decision: on-hand=0, in-transit=2617. Concluded arrivals show realized lead times of 3,2,1,2,1 \u2192 average \u22482 periods (use calculate to capture observed variability). Demand has shifted to a higher regime in recent periods (Period6-10 demands = [587,637,776,963,863]); to match this elevated demand I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 so the OR engine targets the current high-demand regime while accounting for recent volatility. This balances service (higher base stock) against holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

Carry-over insight: Recent sustained changes: realized lead times \u22482 periods (evidence: concluded lead times 3,2,1,2,1 across Periods 4\u20137); demand regime increased markedly \u2014 last 5 demands (Periods 6\u201310) mean \u2248765, high variance.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:

Recent demand regime is much higher \u2014 last 5 demands (Periods 7\u201311) = [637,776,963,863,1136], mean=875 with high variance. Choose L='calculate' to let backend use observed lead-time average; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 so the OR engine forecasts across the (1+L) review+lead period using the elevated recent mean and volatility. This raises base-stock to match the new high-demand regime while the cap prevents excessive single-period orders given lead-time risk and existing large pipeline.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13: recent concluded arrivals show realized lead times averaging \u22482 periods; recent demand regime is markedly higher (last 5 demands: 776, 963, 863, 1136, 1221). On-hand=0, in-transit=2584 \u2014 substantial pipeline exists but arrivals have been lumpy and past shipments sometimes delayed. Choose L by calculate to let backend use observed lead-time history. For demand, use recent_N (N=5) to capture the new high-demand regime for the (1+L) review+lead forecast. Use recent_N for sigma_hat (N=5) to reflect elevated variance. These settings raise base-stock to meet high near-term demand while preserving cap constraints to limit over-ordering given past lost/delayed shipments.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_14: on-hand=0, in-transit=3594, recent demands (Periods 9\u201313) = [963, 863, 1136, 1221, 1246] showing a sustained elevated demand regime. Concluded arrivals yield observed lead times = [3,2,1,2,1,2,2,1] (avg \u22481.75). Because concluded history supports an average lead time near 2 and recent demand is materially higher than earlier history, I set L to be inferred from observed leads (calculate) and use recent_N=5 for demand mean/variance to capture the elevated regime. This ensures mu_hat scales to cover (1+L) periods of the new higher demand while sigma_hat reflects recent volatility, helping the OR backend raise base stock and cap appropriately to avoid stockouts despite prior delayed shipments.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15. Recent concluded lead-times across history cluster around 2 periods (observed sequence 3,2,1,2,1,... average \u22482); demand has shifted up materially \u2014 last 5 demands (Periods 10\u201314) = [863,1136,1221,1246,1265], clearly higher than earlier baseline. On-hand (458) + in-transit (2140)=2598 provides multi-period cover; still use a lead-time estimate based on observed concludes to avoid underordering if delays recede. Choices: L set to calculate so backend uses the average of observed concluded lead times (~2) from history; mu_hat set to recent_N with N=5 to capture the new high-demand regime ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 demands); sigma_hat set to recent_N with N=5 to reflect elevated volatility in the same recent window. These parameters increase target base-stock to serve heightened demand while sigma captures variance to balance service level vs holding cost.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16: recent demand regime is much higher than the initial small-sample history (last demands very large). On-hand=0, in-transit=3290 \u2014 sizable pipeline but demands remain elevated. Observed concluded lead times across history average roughly 1.6\u20132.0 periods; shipments have sometimes taken 1\u20133 periods. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the empirical average of observed lead times. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the elevated, high-variance recent regime (so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 5 demands). For volatility I also use recent_N (N=5) so safety stock scales to recent variability. These choices make the OR engine target service under the new high-demand regime while keeping holding exposure responsive to recent variance and the empirically observed lead time.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_17 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=4347; recent demand regime is markedly higher (last 5 demands mean \u22481357). Concluded historical lead times (from conclude messages) = [3,2,1,2,1,2,2,1,2,1,1] \u2192 average \u22481.64. To be responsive to the elevated recent demand while reflecting observed lead-time behavior, set L by averaging observed lead times (calculate). Use recent 5-sample demand stats for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new high-demand regime and higher variance; this keeps base_stock aligned with current demand spikes and limits over/under-ordering given uncertain in-transit pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Sustained higher demand regime: last 5 demands (Periods 12\u201316) mean\u22481357, high variance; observed concluded lead times average \u22481.6 (use ~1.6 estimate rather than promised if calculating).

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_18: on-hand=0, in-transit=4567. Historical concluded lead times show mostly 1\u20133 with average \u22482; demand has been in a sustained higher regime (recent demands much larger than early history). There are no unconcluded outstanding anomalies now (recent concludes consistent). I choose L by 'calculate' to let backend average observed lead times (captures ~2). For demand I use recent_N with N=5 (most recent 5 demands show the new high-demand regime) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 samples. For sigma_hat I use recent_N N=5 to capture elevated volatility in the same recent window. These choices raise target base-stock to cover the higher recent demand and account for the empirically observed multi-period lead time, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Carry-over insight: Sustained higher demand regime: recent periods show materially higher demand (Periods 13\u201317: 1246,1265,1507,1547,1724; mean\u22481458) \u2014 treat as new regime; observed concluded lead times clustering around 2 periods (evidence: many concluded lead times = 1\u20133, average \u22482).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2930.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_19: recent periods show a sustained higher-demand regime (Periods 14\u201318 demands = 1265,1507,1547,1724,1802; mean \u22481569) and concluded lead times cluster around 1\u20133 periods (multiple concluded arrivals with lead_times 3,2,1,2,1,2,1,3,2). Current inventory: on-hand=674, in-transit=2403. Given the clear upward demand regime, forecast demand using the most recent 5 samples to capture current mean/variance. For lead time, use the observed average of concluded lead times (calculate) rather than the promised value to reflect realized behavior. These choices raise the base stock to meet elevated demand while using recent volatility to set safety stock; available on-hand + large pipeline reduces immediate urgency but pipeline may include staggered arrivals so we keep parameters responsive to recent demand.

Carry-over insight: Sustained higher demand regime: Periods 14\u201318 demands = 1265,1507,1547,1724,1802 (mean\u22481569); concluded lead times cluster ~1\u20133 periods with average \u22482 (use observed average lead time, not promised).

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period_20: on-hand=0, in-transit=4317, recent demand regime is materially higher (multi-period spikes; last 5 demands 1507,1547,1724,1802,2075). Concluded lead times over recent history cluster around 1\u20133 with average \u22482. To capture sustained high demand while reflecting observed lead-time behavior, set L by calculating the average of observed concluded lead times, and set demand and volatility using the most recent 5 demand samples (captures new high-demand regime). This balances service level (higher mu_hat) against holding cost by using recent high-demand mean and matching sigma to recent volatility; using calculate for L also adapts if future concluded lead times shift or missing arrivals appear.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21: on-hand=253, in-transit=3518; profit=2, holding=1. Historical concluded lead-times cluster ~1\u20133 with average \u22482 (evidence: multiple concluded messages across Periods 4\u201320). Demand has shifted to a higher regime (recent demands large: Periods 16\u201320 ~1547,1724,1802,2075,1973). To reflect observed lead-time behavior and the elevated recent demand, set L using calculate (average of observed concluded lead times). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the (1+L)-period forecast on the most recent high-demand regime, reducing understock risk while accounting for higher variance. This raises the backend base_stock and cap appropriately to balance lost-sales risk vs holding cost given high profit:holding ratio.

Daily Reward (R_t): $506.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_22: demand has settled into a sustained high regime (recent five demands large) and concluded arrivals show actual lead times clustered ~1\u20133 with average \u22482. On-hand=0 but large in-transit=5684 covering multiple periods. Given repeated delayed/concluded lead-times, use observed average lead-time (calculate) and focus demand forecast on the most recent high-demand regime to size review+lead demand and volatility. This handles prior lost/delayed shipments by trusting realized lead-time history and recent demand for safety stock calculation.

Carry-over insight: Sustained higher demand regime: last 5 demands (Periods 17\u201321) = [1724,1802,2075,1973,1983], mean\u22481911; concluded lead times cluster 1\u20133 with observed average \u22482 -> treat effective lead time \u22482 until contradicted.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2854.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23. Recent demand has moved to a higher regime: last 5 demands (Periods 18\u201322) = [1802,2075,1973,1983,2221], mean \u2248 2010 and high variance. Observed concluded lead times across history cluster 1\u20133 with effective average \u22482; treat effective L=2 to reflect realized behavior. On-hand=0, in-transit=4796 which covers \u22482.4 periods at recent mean demand (~2010) so pipeline is substantial but not excessive given volatility. Choices: set L explicitly to 2 to match realized arrivals; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to anchor forecasting to the new high-demand regime and capture recent variance. These parameters bias ordering toward meeting elevated demand while letting OR backend apply its service-level cap to limit over-ordering given holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Sustained higher demand regime: Periods 18\u201322 demands mean\u22482010 (values: 1802,2075,1973,1983,2221); concluded lead times cluster 1\u20133 with effective average \u22482 \u2014 treat effective lead time=2 until contradicted.

On-hand=0, in-transit=6147 (large pipeline). To reflect observed effective lead time and recent elevated demand, set L explicitly to 2. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine forecasts over the review+lead window using the most recent high-demand regime and its volatility. This addresses prior delayed/lost shipments by explicitly using the observed effective lead time while avoiding dilution by older low-demand data.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date Period_25. On-hand=0, in-transit=4296. Historical concluded lead times cluster 1\u20133 with average \u22482; recent demand regime is high (last 5 demands much larger than early history). Set L to observed-average (use calculate). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand regime (Periods 20\u201324). This gives the OR engine a demand forecast and volatility aligned with the most recent elevated regime while accounting for observed ~2-period effective lead time and large pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Sustained higher demand regime: last 5 demands (Periods 20\u201324) mean\u22482214, high variance; concluded lead times continue to cluster 1\u20133 with observed average \u22482 \u2014 treat effective lead time \u22482 until contradicted.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26: on-hand=0, in-transit=6066. Historical concluded lead times cluster ~1\u20133 with average \u22482; demand has shifted to a higher regime (recent 5 demands elevated). Use observed lead-time estimate (calculate) and base mu/sigma on the most recent 5 demands to capture the new high-demand regime and high variance; this keeps base-stock responsive while accounting for the ~2-period arrival pattern and current pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Sustained higher demand regime: last 5 demands (Periods 21\u201325) mean\u22482340; concluded lead times cluster 1\u20133 with observed average \u22482 \u2014 treat effective lead time\u22482 until contradicted.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3960.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_27: on-hand=1330, in-transit=3690. Recent periods show a sustained higher demand regime: last 5 demands (Periods 22\u201326) = [2221,2326,2566,2604,2645], mean\u22482472 and high variance. Concluded lead times across recent arrivals cluster 1\u20133 with observed average \u22482. To reflect the new demand regime and observed effective lead time, set L explicitly to 2, use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to target (1+L)\xd7recent mean demand, and recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. These settings ensure the OR backend scales base-stock to current high demand while using observed lead time to avoid underordering given past delayed arrivals.

Carry-over insight: New sustained higher demand regime: Periods 22\u201326 demands mean\u22482472 (values: 2221,2326,2566,2604,2645); concluded lead times cluster 1\u20133 with observed average \u22482 \u2192 treat effective lead time=2 until contradicted.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Observed concluded lead times historically cluster 1\u20133 with average \u22482, so use calculated average lead time to reflect realized behavior. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the new high-demand regime and elevated volatility; this yields (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std for correct safety stock scaling. On-hand=0 and in-transit=6228 provide multi-period coverage but parameters aim to balance service (q=profit/(profit+holding)=2/3) vs holding cost given high demand uncertainty.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29: on-hand=0, in-transit=8537, recent demand is in a sustained high regime (last 5 demands: Periods 24\u201328 = 2566,2604,2645,2890,2643). Concluded historical lead times cluster 1\u20133 with average \u22482 \u2014 use observed lead-time regime rather than promised. Set L to 'calculate' so backend uses average of observed lead times. For demand forecast use recent_N with N=5 to capture the current elevated regime (reduces bias from older low-demand periods). For volatility use recent_N N=5 to reflect current high variance. These choices push the OR engine to target a higher base-stock to meet elevated demand while reflecting current lead-time reality; with profit=2 and holding=1 this balances service level vs holding cost under the new regime. Expected pipeline (8537) will be reconciled by backend when computing final order.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4534.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_30: recent demand is very high and volatile (last 5 demands mean \u22482720), on-hand=1094, in-transit=4801. Concluded historical lead times cluster 1\u20133 with average \u22482, so use calculated average lead time to let backend infer L from observations. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new high-demand regime (covering the most recent 5 demands) so base-stock and caps respond to elevated mean and variance while accounting for current pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed: last 5 demands (Periods 25\u201329) mean\u22482720, high variance; concluded lead times continue clustering 1\u20133 with observed average \u22482 \u2014 treat effective lead time\u22482 until contradicted.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_31: demand has been in a sustained high regime (recent 5-period mean ~2773); on-hand=0, in-transit=7727 which roughly covers multiple review+lead periods. Observed concluded lead times cluster ~1\u20133 with average \u22482, so use calculated average lead time to reflect realized behavior. To align the OR base-stock to the recent high-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 demands (captures current mean and volatility). This balances service (raise target to meet high demand) while recognizing pipeline already large to avoid extreme over-ordering if some shipments are delayed/lost.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=52, in-transit=6005 \u2192 pipeline=6057, which covers multiple periods at current demand. Observed concluded lead times average ~2 historically; promised lead time=2, so use default lead time. To capture the new high-demand regime I use recent_N (N=5) for demand mean and variance so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect current elevated mean/volatility. These parameters will raise the base stock to meet service levels under high demand while recognizing holding cost via the OR's cap.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33: observed very high, volatile demand over recent periods (Periods 28\u201332: 2643,2814,2873,3046,3005). On-hand=0, in-transit=8617 (large pipeline). Concluded lead times historically cluster 1\u20133 with average \u22482; promised lead time=2, so use default L to align with contractual expectation while relying on recent demand to size orders. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the new high-demand regime (latest 5 periods) so the backend computes base stock for (1+L) review+lead horizon and elevated volatility\u2014this preserves service during lead-time variability and uses the large in-transit buffer to avoid over-ordering.

Carry-over insight: Sustained higher demand regime confirmed: recent 5-period mean \u22482876 (Periods 28\u201332); concluded lead times continue to cluster 1\u20133 with effective average \u22482 \u2014 treat effective lead time=2 until contradicted.

On-hand=0, in-transit=7373 \u2014 pipeline likely short of (L+1)-period demand under current high regime. Historical concluded lead times cluster ~1\u20133 with effective ~2, so use promised/default lead time to keep OR engine expectations aligned.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_36: demand regime is the sustained high-demand regime seen across recent periods (last 5 demands much higher than early history). Concluded arrivals across history cluster lead times 1\u20133 with average \u22482; use inferred lead-time signal rather than promised. Choices: L set to 'calculate' so backend averages observed concluded lead times (~2). For demand forecast (mu_hat) use recent_N with N=5 to capture the current high-demand regime (focus on most recent 5 periods). For volatility (sigma_hat) use recent_N with N=5 to reflect current high variance. This configuration tells the OR engine to provision (1+L)\xd7recent mean demand with recent volatility, aligning safety stock to observed lead-time and elevated demand while avoiding overstating older low-demand periods. On-hand=0 and large in-transit (~10019) will be accounted for by the backend pipeline when computing final order.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_37: on-hand=0, in-transit=10675. Concluded arrivals across history show lead times clustering 1\u20133 with mean \u22482; recent demand regime is much higher than early history (very large demands last ~15+ periods). Use observed lead-time signal and recent-demand sample to capture current high-volatility regime. Set L to be inferred from concluded lead times (calculate). Use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to target the current high-demand regime (last 5 demands) so base-stock covers (1+L) periods of the elevated demand and volatility; this balances service (profit>holding) while avoiding underforecasting given large pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Sustained higher demand regime: recent 5-period means \u226b earlier history (persistent high demands); concluded lead times cluster 1\u20133 with observed average \u22482 \u2014 treat effective lead time \u22482 until contradicted.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39: recent demand is in a sustained high regime (last periods show multi-thousand demands) and concluded lead times have clustered 1\u20133 with observed average \u22482. Use calculated average lead time to reflect realized behavior. Set demand forecast using recent_N (last 5) to capture the elevated mean/variance. Use recent_N for sigma to reflect current volatility. Current on-hand (506) + in-transit (6041) provide large pipeline coverage; parameters aim to align base-stock with realized lead time and recent high demand to avoid stockouts while controlling holding cost.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period=40. Recent demand regime is high and volatile (recent concluded demands >> early history); concluded lead-times cluster 1\u20133 with average \u22482. On-hand=0, in-transit=10046 (large pipeline). To reflect observed effective lead time use calculate (average of observed lead times \u22482). For demand forecast use recent_N with N=5 to capture the current high-demand regime and its mean across the review+lead period. For volatility use recent_N N=5 to reflect recent variance. These settings let the OR engine compute a base-stock tuned to the elevated recent mean while the large in-transit pipeline will cap new orders, avoiding excess holding cost given holding=$1 and profit=$2.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41: on-hand=0, in-transit=12536. Historical concluded lead times cluster 1\u20133 with average \u22482 \u2192 treat effective L=2. Recent demand has stepped up again: last 5 demands (Periods 36\u201340) = [3448,3748,3929,4212,4461], mean \u22483959 and high variance. To match the elevated regime while covering review+lead window, set L explicitly to 2, use a recent_N demand forecast (last 5) for mu_hat to capture current mean, and use recent_N (last 5) for sigma_hat to capture current volatility. This ensures pipeline+order targets scale to the new high-demand regime and that the OR backend produces a higher base-stock while accounting for observed lead-time delays.

Carry-over insight: New sustained demand increase: last 5 demands (Periods 36\u201340) mean \u22483959, high variance; continue treating effective lead time \u22482 based on recent concluded lead times.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_42: on-hand=0, in-transit=12536; recent demand regime is substantially higher than early history (multi-period elevated demands). Concluded lead times in history cluster 1\u20133 with average \u22482; earlier prolonged missing arrivals resolved, supporting an effective lead time of 2. Choose L explicit=2 to reflect observed operational reality (not promised). For demand forecast use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current high-demand regime (keeps mu_hat responsive to the elevated mean/variance). For sigma_hat use recent_N (N=5) so safety stock reflects recent volatility. These settings steer the OR engine to size base stock for the current high-demand, higher-variance regime and account for the empirically observed ~2-period effective lead time, mitigating stockouts while controlling holding costs given high turnover.

On-hand=2455, in-transit=6041 provides substantial cover but we must forecast for the (1+L) review+lead horizon. Set L via observed lead-time average (calculate) to reflect realized lead time \u22482.

Observed concluded lead times historically cluster ~1\u20133 with average \u22482; promised lead time=2 and concluded evidence supports using default promised L. On-hand=0, in-transit=10533 which is slightly below (1+L)*recent mean (~12497), so backend should target higher base stock; therefore I use recent_N (N=5) for demand mean and volatility to capture the new high-demand regime while keeping L=default to match observed average lead time and promised setting.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period_45: demand has settled into a sustained high regime \u2014 recent 5-period demands (Periods 40\u201344) = [4461,4166,4040,3950,4444], mean=4212.2. Concluded arrivals across history cluster lead times 1\u20133 with average \u22482; treat effective lead time as 2 to cover observed delays/lags. On-hand=0, in-transit=12643 which roughly matches (1+L)\xd7recent mean (3\xd74212\u224812636) so pipeline is adequate. Choices: set L explicit=2 based on concluded lead-time evidence; set mu_hat recent_N with N=5 to capture the new high-demand regime (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean of last 5); set sigma_hat recent_N with N=5 to reflect recent elevated volatility. These parameters align base-stock to current demand level and observed lead time, balancing service (high profit) against holding cost given large pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed: last 5 demands (Periods 40\u201344) mean\u22484212; concluded lead times cluster 1\u20133 with observed average \u22482 \u2014 treat effective lead time=2 until contradicted.

On-hand=128, in-transit=8319 (pipeline large). Use observed effective lead time rather than promised to size review+lead demand. Set L by averaging observed lead times (calculate) to reflect realized ~2-period behavior.

These choices steer the OR base-stock toward meeting very high near-term demand while the large pipeline reduces aggressive ordering risk.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 48: demand has been in a sustained high regime for many periods (recent 5-period means >> early history) and concluded lead times cluster 1\u20133 with observed average \u22482. On-hand=0, in-transit=12988 (large pipeline). Choose L='calculate' to let backend use observed concluded lead times average (reflects empirical \u22482). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand, high-variance regime (focus on the most recent 5 demands). These settings raise the base-stock to protect service during the high-demand regime while using empirical lead-time so pipeline coverage aligns with realized arrivals; using recent statistics helps avoid under-forecasting given the regime shift and large variance.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Context: Period 49. Recent concluded lead times cluster 1\u20133 with observed average \u22482. Recent demand is in a sustained high regime; last 5 demands (Periods 44\u201348) = [4444,4364,4530,4595,4776], mean \u22484542. On-hand=0, in-transit=14708 which comfortably covers (1+L)=3 periods of forecast demand (~3\xd74542\u224813626). Decisions: set L explicit=2 to reflect observed effective lead time; use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand regime and volatility so OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std. This balances service (high demand & observed lead time) vs holding cost given large in-transit buffer.

Carry-over insight: Effective lead time \u22482 periods (evidence: many concluded lead times 1\u20133, recent average \u22482); sustained high-demand regime confirmed (last 5 demands mean\u22484542, high variance).

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_50 with on-hand=0 and in-transit=9871. Historical concluded lead times cluster 1\u20133 with observed average \u22482; recent demand is in a sustained high regime (last 5 demands: 4364,4530,4595,4776,5087 \u2192 mean\u22484670). To balance service level vs holding cost, set effective lead time=2 and forecast demand using the most recent 5 periods to capture the new regime and elevated variance.

Carry-over insight: Effective lead time\u22482 periods (evidence: many concluded lead times 1\u20133 across recent periods); sustained high-demand regime (last 5 demands mean\u22484670, high variance).
