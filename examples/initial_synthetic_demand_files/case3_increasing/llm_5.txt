Current in-transit = 12,800 equals orders placed in P44\u2013P46 (3700, 4100, 5000) with arrivals during Periods 48, 49, 50 respectively. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand = 0 now; expected arrivals during the selling horizon (P48\u2013P50) total 12,800. Forecast demand for remaining horizon (P48\u2013P50) \u2248 4,483 \xd7 3 \u2248 13,450 \u2014 slight shortfall (~650\u2013700 units). e) Ordering decision: Any order placed now (Period 48) would arrive in Period 52 (48+4) \u2014 after the game horizon (Period 50) and cannot be sold before the end. Therefore do not place an order to avoid unnecessary holding cost for post-horizon arrivals.",
