Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. No concluded arrivals observed; on-hand=0, in-transit=0 so there are no overdue shipments. Historical demand samples for chips(Regular) = [112,97,116,138,94], mean ~111.4. Promised lead time is 4 and no evidence to the contrary yet, so use default lead time. Use default demand/volatility calculations ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to size the base-stock covering the review+lead horizon and balance profit vs holding cost given Profit=$2, Holding=$1.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
No concluded arrivals beyond Period 1, so actual lead time is still unknown (order placed Period 1 arrived=0). Use promised lead time to avoid over-adjusting. Current in-transit=141 from Period 1; with on-hand=0 this partially covers upcoming demand but not confirmed arrivals. Use default demand and volatility calculations so OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full historical samples; this balances service level vs holding cost given no reliable changepoint or season signal yet.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
No concluded arrivals yet; both orders placed in Periods 1\u20132 (141+138=279) remain in-transit and may still arrive given promised lead time=4. On-hand=0 while pipeline=279. No observed lead-time samples to infer a different L, and historical demand samples (112,97,116,138,94) show no clear changepoint. Use default (promised) lead time to let OR backend apply L=4. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample set; this balances service level against holding cost given current uncertainty and overdue-but-not-concluded shipments.

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
No concluded arrivals yet for orders placed in Periods 1-3 (ordered total 497, in-transit=497, arrived=0). On-hand=0, so risk of stockout this period if demand occurs. No concluded lead-time observations exist, so cannot infer actual lead time; use promised lead time. Demand history (samples [112,97,116,138,94]) shows mean ~111.4. Use default methods so OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std with L=promised 4, balancing service level against holding cost given high in-transit inventory but uncertain arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Outstanding shipments (orders from Periods 1-3 totaling 497) have not concluded by Period 4; potential prolonged lead time or lost shipments\u2014monitor for eventual arrivals in future concludes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
No concluded arrivals have been observed for prior orders (Periods 1\u20134 orders all arrived=0), so actual lead time cannot be reliably inferred and outstanding in-transit (769) may include lost shipments. Use promised lead time (default) to keep OR backend assumptions aligned with supplier promise. Demand history (samples [112,97,116,138,94]) shows no clear recent changepoint; use full-sample defaults for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std respectively. This keeps the policy stable given high pipeline uncertainty and balances service level vs holding cost conservatively.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Context: Period_6. On-hand=0, in-transit=872. Historical demands = [112,97,116,138,94] (mean=111.4). Observed concluded lead time so far: Period5 shows arrival of Period1 order with lead_time=4. Several later orders remain unconcluded (possible delays/losses). Decision: set L via 'calculate' to use observed lead times (avg=4) so the OR backend aligns with actual arrivals seen. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor forecasts to full-sample historical demand scaled by (1+L)=5, preserving stability given limited samples and uncertain in-transit status. This balances service level (using observed L) against holding cost by not inflating demand forecasts beyond historical evidence while letting OR cap orders via its policy given large pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $276.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period: Period_7. On-hand=0, in-transit=1030. Recent concluded arrivals show orders placed on Period 1 and Period 2 arrived with lead_time=4 (Period_5 and Period_6 concludes). Demand history samples: [112,97,116,138,94]. Outstanding in-transit includes later orders (e.g., Period 3 order still in transit expected to arrive with lead_time\u22484). Given confirmed lead_time=4 from concluded messages, use calculated lead time to reflect observed reality. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples \u2014 this leverages full history while the confirmed L increases the review+lead horizon to cover demand during the wait. This balances service level (longer coverage for actual 4-period lead time) against holding cost by letting the OR engine compute safety stock via profit/holding tradeoff.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time = 4 periods (evidence: arrivals in Period_5 from Period_1 and Period_6 from Period_2, both with lead_time=4). Earlier outstanding shipments were partially resolved; monitor remaining in-transit orders for expected arrivals at L=4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $436.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
On-hand=0, in-transit=1157. Concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=4 (Period5: P1->4, Period6: P2->4, Period7: P3->4). Use calculate for L to reflect observed lead time. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this leverages full historical demand (mean\u2248111.4) while keeping parameterization stable given consistent lead-time evidence. Pipeline (1157) materially exceeds (1+L)\xd7mean (~557), so orders will be capped by pipeline; defaults balance service vs holding cost.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_9: on-hand=0, in-transit=1294. Concluded arrivals (Periods 5-8) consistently show lead_time=4 for orders from Periods 1-4, confirming actual lead time aligns with promised L=4. Large in-transit pipeline likely already covers multiple future demands; using default L and default demand estimates lets the OR engine compute base_stock = (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all historical samples, which balances service level given confirmed L while avoiding overreacting to recent large realized demands that are already reflected in pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $488.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Context: Period 10. On-hand=0, in-transit=1550. Concluded history shows consistent actual lead_time = 4 (arrivals in Periods 5-9 correspond to orders in Periods 1-5 with lead_time=4). Demand has accelerated sharply in recent periods (recent period demands: 448,587,637,776,963 \u2014 clear upward regime vs. earlier samples). Reconciliation: pipeline (1550) covers only part of rapidly rising demand; no on-hand stock. Decisions: keep L = default (promised lead time = 4) because concluded arrivals confirm actual L=4. For demand forecast use recent_N to capture the new high-demand regime; choose N=5 (use last 5 periods to reflect current trend). Use recent_N for sigma_hat with N=5 to capture recent volatility. These parameters let the OR backend scale base stock to the new demand level while using recent volatility to size safety stock, balancing service level vs. holding cost under confirmed L=4.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained actual lead_time = 4 periods (evidence: Period_5 arrival from Period_1; Period_6 from Period_2; Period_7 from Period_3; Period_8 from Period_4; Period_9 from Period_5). Detected new high-demand regime starting around Period_5: recent period demands [448,587,637,776,963] >> earlier levels; adjust forecasts/volatility to recent 5-period regime.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Period 11. On-hand=0, in-transit=2259. Historical concludes confirm actual lead_time = 4 (multiple concluded arrivals from Periods 1\u20136 all with lead_time=4). Demand shifted to a higher regime starting Period 5 (recent demands: 448,587,637,776,963,863). I set L to 'calculate' to reflect the observed actual lead time (backend will compute average observed lead times = 4). For forecasting, I use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new high-demand regime (use last 6 demands from Periods 5\u201310). This raises the base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of the new demand level while sigma_hat recent_N increases safety stock to reflect recent volatility, balancing higher service level against holding cost given profit=$2 vs holding=$1.

I set L via calculate to lock in observed lead-time evidence. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=7 to base (1+L)-period forecast and volatility on the identified high-demand regime, improving service for elevated demand while the OR backend computes safety stock using profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_13: on-hand=0, in-transit=3683. Historical concludes show consistent actual lead_time=4 (arrivals from orders placed 4 periods earlier across Periods5-12). Demand regime shifted up starting ~Period_5 (recent demands large: Periods5-12 = [448,587,637,776,963,863,1136,1221]); use recent-demand estimates to capture higher mean and volatility. Set L to default (promised 4) since promised=4 and confirmed by concluded arrivals. Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=8 (Periods5-12) to reflect the sustained high-demand regime; this increases base_stock and safety stock to avoid stockouts while acknowledging higher holding cost through OR's capped order. These parameters align pipeline targets with (L+1)-period demand under the new regime and mitigate lost-sales risk given large in-transit volume.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Period_14. On-hand=0, in-transit=3905. Historical concludes confirm sustained actual lead time = 4 periods and a clear high-demand regime starting Period_5 (recent demands much larger than early samples). Expect demand to remain at elevated levels; pipeline is large but arrivals follow L=4. Chosen methods: L: default (use promised lead time = 4) because concluded history repeatedly shows lead_time=4 and promised equals actual; mu_hat: recent_N with N=9 to base the (1+L)\xd7mean forecast on the nine most recent high-demand samples (Periods 5\u201313) capturing the new regime; sigma_hat: recent_N with N=9 to capture volatility in the same recent regime. These settings steer the OR backend to target a base stock reflecting the high-demand regime while using observed lead time so orders arrive in line with confirmed timing, balancing service level vs holding cost given large in-transit volume.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Actual lead time has been consistently 4 periods (concluded arrivals show lead_time=4). Demand shifted to a sustained higher regime beginning around Period_5; recent periods show much larger demands than the very early samples. On-hand=0, in-transit=3649 provides substantial pipeline cover; to adapt the OR backend to the new regime I use the promised/default L and forecast/volatility based on the most recent demand regime (N=5) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect current high mean and dispersion while keeping ordering responsive to observed lead time.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_16: confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods from concluded history. Current on-hand=0, in-transit=4042 (large pipeline) while demand has been in a sustained higher regime since Period_5. Use promised/default lead time to match observed behavior. Forecast (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) will use recent_N with N=5 to capture the high-demand regime (most recent five demands) so the OR backend orders to cover the (1+L) review+lead demand under current elevated demand and variance, avoiding understocking while the large pipeline depletes.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Actual lead time has been consistently 4 periods (multiple concluded arrivals show lead_time=4). On-hand=0, in-transit=4394 \u2014 substantial pipeline expected to arrive given L=4, so forecasts should use the recent high-demand regime rather than older low-rate data. Demand shifted up starting around Period_5 (recent high-demand samples far exceed initial five low samples); I use recent_N=5 to capture the elevated mean/volatility and avoid diluting with early low-demand history. This balances higher service-level needs against holding cost given large pipeline inventory.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18: confirmed sustained actual lead_time=4 (historical concludes all show lead_time 4). Recent demand regime is high (large demands from Period 5 onward); on-hand=0, in-transit=5287 (covers upcoming demand partly). Use lead time = promised/confirmed 4. Set mu_hat using recent_N to capture the high-demand regime (use last 5 demand samples to forecast (1+L)-period demand). Set sigma_hat using recent_N (last 5) to reflect elevated volatility. These choices steer the OR backend toward a base-stock sized for the new high-demand regime while using observed lead time to avoid underordering or excess holding.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Actual lead time has been consistently 4 periods (concluded arrivals from Periods 5-18 show lead_time=4). Demand shifted to a sustained higher regime beginning around Period 5 (recent demands much larger than early samples). On-hand=0 and large in-transit (6329) confirm many units already ordered. Use L=default (promised lead time=4) to match confirmed reality and keep OR engine assumption. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture the most recent high-demand regime (use last 5 period demands to forecast (1+L)-period demand and volatility), which balances service-level for elevated demand while avoiding overreaction to older low-demand samples.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Observed sustained high-demand regime continuing through Period 19 (recent demands much larger than original small-sample history). On-hand=0, in-transit=6628 \u2014 substantial pipeline consistent with confirmed actual lead_time=4 (matches promised). Use default L to keep promised lead time (backend already assumes 4 and historical concludes confirm actual L=4). For demand forecast use recent_N with N=5 to capture the current high-demand regime (most recent demands: Periods 15\u201319 = [1507,1547,1724,1802,2075]); this scales mu_hat for (1+L) review+lead window to reflect elevated demand. Use sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to capture increased volatility from the same recent regime. These choices prioritize service (meeting very high demand) while letting backend cap orders via its cap logic to limit excess holding given holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3008.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Observed concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead_time = 4 periods (multiple Period concludes from Period_5 onward). Demand shifted to a higher regime starting around Period_5 \u2014 recent demands (Periods 5\u201320) are substantially larger than early-sample levels. On-hand=0 and in-transit=7230 provides multi-period cover; given confirmed L=4 and the sustained higher-demand regime, I use lead-time averaging and recent-window forecasts to make mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the new regime so the OR backend raises base stock and safety stock appropriately to trade off the $2 profit vs $1 holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained actual lead_time = 4 periods (evidence: concluded arrivals from Period_5..Period_20 showing lead_time=4). New high-demand regime beginning ~Period_5: recent demands (Periods 5\u201320) are elevated vs earlier periods; use recent-window forecasts/volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3230.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Actual lead time has been consistently 4 periods in concluded history through Period 21; on-hand=0 and in-transit=5615 so pipeline is large. Demand shifted to a sustained high regime beginning ~Period 5 (recent demands from Periods 5\u201321 far above initial five-sample levels). I therefore keep L at the promised/default (4) and use recent-window estimates for demand mean and volatility to capture the elevated regime. Chosen N=17 to span the regime from Period 5\u219221 (regime length=17) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect recent high mean and higher variance; this balances service level against holding cost given large pipeline.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

On-hand=0, in-transit=5109 (pipeline large). I set L using observed lead times (calculate) to reflect confirmed L=4. For forecasts I use recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the high-demand regime (focus on most recent 5 demand observations to adapt mean and volatility quickly). This keeps the OR backend responsive to elevated demand while using observed L to align pipeline coverage and avoid underordering given the large in-transit volume.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Observed history shows consistent concluded arrivals with lead_time=4 since Period_5 and large, sustained demand growth beginning at Period_5 (recent demands much higher than the initial small-sample series). On-hand=0 and large in-transit=5655 (expected arrivals at L=4) \u2014 do not treat shipments as lost. Set L to promised/default (4) to match confirmed actual lead time. Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat using the recent high-demand regime window (Periods ~5\u201323, regime length 19) so the OR engine forecasts and safety stock reflect the elevated mean and volatility; this reduces stockouts while controlling holding by using recent demand stats rather than the tiny early-sample mean.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_25 decision: on-hand=0, in-transit=5377. Historical concludes clearly show sustained actual lead_time=4 (arrivals from Period_5..Period_24 correspond to orders placed 4 periods earlier). Demand has been in a sustained higher regime since ~Period_5 (Periods 5\u201324) \u2014 use the recent elevated window to set forecast and volatility. Set L to promised/default (4) since actual lead time matches promise. Use recent_N with N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the high-demand regime (regime length \u224820 samples from Period_5\u201324). This increases base_stock to meet elevated demand while sigma_hat from recent_N captures current volatility so OR backend balances service level vs holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Observed sustained actual lead_time=4 (multiple conclude messages showing lead_time=4). On-hand=0, in-transit=7820 covering several future periods. Demand has shifted to a high regime (recent large demands); use recent-window estimates to reflect current mean/volatility. Set L=calculate to lock to observed lead time average; set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N with N=5 to capture the elevated recent-demand regime and higher variance, improving service while controlling holding costs given large pipeline.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Confirmed sustained actual lead_time=4 from concluded arrivals (consistent arrivals showing lead_time=4). Demand shifted to a higher regime starting ~Period_5 (recent demands Periods 5\u201326 greatly exceed early samples). On-hand=0 with in-transit=9297 provides pipeline cover but we must forecast using the elevated regime. Set L to default (promised 4). Use recent_N window for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the high-demand regime; regime length since Period_5 \u2248 22 periods so cap N at 20 to focus on most recent elevated behavior and recent volatility. This balances service (capture recent high mean) vs holding cost by using observed recent variance rather than over-weighting early low-demand data.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained actual lead_time = 4 periods (evidence: concluded arrivals from Period_5..Period_26 all show lead_time=4); New sustained high-demand regime beginning ~Period_5 (elevated demands in Periods 5\u201326 vs earlier periods).

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Confirmed sustained actual lead_time=4 (arrivals in concluded periods show lead_time=4 consistently). Demand shifted to a higher regime starting ~Period_5 (much larger demands in concludes from Period_5 onward). On-hand=0, in-transit=7033 \u2014 substantial pipeline but demand remains elevated. To capture the sustained L=4 regime use 'calculate' (average observed lead times). For demand forecast and volatility use recent-window estimates focused on the new high-demand regime: recent_N with N=20 (regime length >20, so use 20) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect elevated mean and variance and keep service levels appropriate given profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Actual lead time has been consistently 4 periods (concluded arrivals show lead_time=4 across recent history). Demand entered a sustained high-demand regime beginning ~Period_5; recent demands (Periods 5\u201328) are much higher than initial samples. On-hand is 0 with 7,625 units in-transit (covers multiple future periods). To align the OR engine with observed lead time and elevated demand I select: L=default to keep promised lead time (matches observed behavior and OR expectations); mu_hat using recent_N with N=20 to base (1+L)-period demand forecast on the most recent 20 high-demand observations; sigma_hat using recent_N with N=20 to capture recent volatility. These choices shift the base-stock toward the current high-demand regime while respecting the 4-period lead time and limiting overstock by using recent-window estimates.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_30: on-hand=0, in-transit=7461. Concluded history shows consistent arrivals with lead_time=4 from Period_5..Period_29 -> sustained actual lead time=4 and a high-demand regime beginning ~Period_5. I keep L as promised (default) since promised=4 matches observed actuals. Demand is now much higher than initial seed samples; use recent-window forecasts to capture the elevated mean/volatility. Choose recent_N with N=20 (regime length Period_5..Period_29 \u224825 -> cap at 20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the most relevant 20 recent samples, which balances service level (avoid stockouts given large pipeline) versus holding cost given high demand and large in-transit stock.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Context: Period_31. On-hand=0, in-transit=7603. Historical concludes show consistent arrivals with lead_time=4 (Periods 5\u201330), so actual lead time = 4 confirmed. Demand shifted to a sustained high-demand regime beginning ~Period_5; recent periods much larger than early-sample baseline. To capture the sustained higher mean and volatility, use recent-window estimates over the large recent regime. Choice: L=default to keep promised lead time (4) which matches observed arrivals; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=20 to compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the last 20 demand samples, which balances responsiveness to the high-demand regime while smoothing short-term noise. This ensures pipeline targets cover (L+1) periods of the new demand level and the OR backend will compute a base-stock that trades off the $2 profit vs $1 holding cost.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Sustained actual lead_time=4 confirmed by concluded arrivals across many periods. On-hand=0, in-transit=10645 \u2014 substantial pipeline that will arrive with L\u22484. Demand has been in a sustained high regime since ~Period_5; to capture recent elevated mean and volatility, use recent-window estimates. Set L to default (promised 4). Use recent_N with N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the last ~20 high-demand periods and limit noise from earlier low-demand history. This balances service (capture high recent demand) vs holding cost by relying on observed pipeline plus up-to-date demand mean/variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4840.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 33. History shows confirmed sustained actual lead_time = 4 (multiple concluded arrivals with lead_time=4 through Period 32) and a clear high-demand regime beginning ~Period 5 (concluded demands from Periods 5\u201332 are much higher than the initial small-sample demands). On-hand=0, in-transit=8901 \u2014 large pipeline consistent with L=4 arrivals pattern. I set L to default (promised lead time = 4) because concluded history confirms that lead time and the promised value matches observed arrivals. For demand forecasting I use recent_N with N=20 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained high-demand regime (use the most recent 20 demand observations within the elevated regime). This keeps the base-stock responsive to the new demand level while sigma_hat from the same recent window captures elevated volatility; together they help the OR backend raise target inventory to avoid stockouts given the long lead time while limiting excess holding by using a recent-window estimate rather than the tiny initial-sample mean.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_34: on-hand = 0, in-transit = 9475. Historical concludes show a sustained actual lead_time = 4 (arrivals consistently reference lead_time=4). Demand has clearly moved to a higher regime beginning ~Period_5; recent demands are much larger than the initial small-sample history. I set L by calculating observed lead times to reflect confirmed L=4. For forecasting I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current high-demand regime and recent volatility so the OR engine sizes base-stock and cap to meet elevated demand while controlling holding costs given high in-transit inventory.

Carry-over insight: New sustained high-demand regime beginning ~Period_5: recent periods (Periods 5\u201333) show substantially elevated demand vs earlier periods; actual lead_time confirmed = 4 (arrivals in concluded periods consistently show lead_time=4).

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_35: on-hand=0, in-transit=9967. Concluded history shows consistent arrivals with lead_time=4 (Periods 5..34 arrivals reference orders placed 4 periods earlier) \u2014 actual lead time sustained at 4. Demand regime shifted up starting ~Period_5 (much larger demands since then); recent-period demand is the best forecast anchor. I therefore keep L at the promised/default (4) and set demand mean and volatility using the recent high-demand regime. Using recent_N=5 captures the latest demand level and variability (responsive to current spike) so the OR backend will target a higher base-stock to avoid stockouts while capping orders via its cap parameter to limit overstock given holding cost.

Period_36: sustained actual lead_time=4 (concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4). On-hand=0, in-transit=10442 \u2014 large pipeline consistent with recent high-demand regime beginning ~Period_5. Use promised/default lead time to align with observed stable L=4. Use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained high-demand regime (many large demands since Period_5); N=20 balances recency with sample size to estimate (1+L)-period demand and volatility. This setup gives the OR engine a forecast and variability that reflect the elevated demand while respecting the confirmed lead time and existing in-transit stock so orders are sized to meet service targets without excessive extra holding cost.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period_37: on-hand=0, in-transit=12558. Concluded history consistently shows actual lead_time=4 (arrivals from Period_5..Period_36 with lead_time=4) and a sustained high-demand regime beginning ~Period_5 \u2014 recent demands (Periods 32\u201336 = [3005,3391,3368,3282,3448]) remain elevated.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Observed context: Period_38 with on-hand=0 and large in-transit=13292. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead_time=4 (arrivals from Period_5..Period_37 all indicate lead_time=4) and a sustained high-demand regime beginning ~Period_5 (demands since Period_5 >> earlier samples). Changepoint evidence: regime start at Period_5; regime length through Period_37 = 33 periods. To match confirmed actual lead time and recent elevated demand, set L to default (promised=4, matches observed). Use recent-window forecasts to focus the OR backend on the high-demand regime: mu_hat recent_N with N=20 (cap recent window to 20 per rules) so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean of last 20 demand samples; sigma_hat recent_N with N=20 to reflect recent volatility. This keeps orders aligned with the sustained higher demand while relying on confirmed L=4, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_39: confirmed sustained actual lead_time=4 from concluded arrivals through Period_38; on-hand=0, in-transit=10814 (ample pipeline). Demand has been in a sustained high regime since ~Period_5; to capture recent elevated mean/volatility use a recent-window. Choose L='default' to trust promised lead time (4) which matches concluded evidence. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=20 to reflect the most recent 20-period high-demand regime (N chosen per rule: min(regime_length,20)=20), so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7recent mean and volatility scaled for review+lead period and balances service vs holding costs given current large pipeline.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_40: confirmed sustained actual lead_time = 4 (consistent concluded arrivals). On-hand=0, in-transit=11075 which is ~3.0 recent-periods of demand but short of required (L+1=5) coverage. Recent demand has been in a sustained high regime (recent demands: Periods 35-39 = [3282,3448,3748,3929,4212], mean \u22483723.8). To match current regime and preserve service while limiting holding cost, set L to promised/default (4) and estimate demand/volatility from the most recent 5 high-demand periods so the OR backend targets the elevated mean and observed variability.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_41: on-hand=0, in-transit=12618. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead_time=4 and a sustained high-demand regime since ~Period_5 (recent demands are much larger than the initial five-sample seed). I keep L as default (promised = 4) because concluded history confirms sustained 4-period lead time. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to anchor forecasts/volatility to the most recent high-demand regime (captures current elevated mean and variability and keeps orders responsive to recent demand surges). This keeps the OR base-stock focused on (L+1)-period demand under the current high-demand regime and prevents underordering given large pipeline and zero on-hand.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_42: confirmed sustained actual lead_time = 4 (historical concludes consistently show lead_time=4). Demand has been in a sustained high regime since ~Period_5; use recent-window estimates to capture elevated mean and volatility. On-hand=0, in-transit=13640 \u2014 substantial pipeline consistent with L=4. Choose L='default' (use promised lead time =4) to align with observed confirmed lead time and OR backend expectations. Use mu_hat recent_N with N=20 and sigma_hat recent_N with N=20 to base (1+L)-period forecast and volatility on the most recent 20 demands (captures the high-demand regime while respecting the recent_N rules). This balances service level (cover elevated demand) against holding cost by relying on recent data rather than long-ago low-demand samples.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Actual lead time remains confirmed at 4 periods from concluded arrivals; recent demand is in a sustained high regime (large demands since Period_5). On-hand=0, in-transit=15618 provides coverage but we should forecast using the recent high-demand regime. Set L explicitly to 4 to match observed arrivals. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets the latest high-demand behavior (responsive mean and volatility estimates over the most recent 5 periods). This balances service (higher safety stock for elevated demand) against holding cost given large in-transit volume.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_44: on-hand=0, in-transit=16332. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead_time = 4 (multiple concluded arrivals from Period_5..Period_43 with lead_time=4). Demand has been in a sustained high regime since ~Period_5; recent 39-period elevated regime is best represented by a recent-window forecast. I set L to default (promised lead time = 4) because concluded history confirms stable L=4 and promised=4. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=20 (backend rule: recent regime length capped at 20) to capture the elevated mean and volatility from the recent high-demand regime; this ensures the base-stock and caps reflect current demand while accounting for 4-period lead time and pipeline. This balances service (avoid stockouts given large pipeline depletion risk) against holding cost by using recent demand statistics rather than diluting with much smaller early-period demand.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:

Demand exhibits a sustained high-demand regime beginning ~Period_5 (recent concluded demands >> early samples). To align the OR backend with observed regime and maintain service while limiting holding cost, set lead time to promised (default=4 observed), use recent-window demand forecast to capture elevated mean, and recent-window volatility to capture higher variance. Methods: L default to use promised lead time (matches observed); mu_hat recent_N (N=5) to base (1+L)-period demand on the most recent 5 periods of high demand; sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility.

Current inventory: on-hand=245, in-transit=13010 (large pipeline covering multiple periods). I set L to default (promised lead time=4) because concluded history repeatedly shows lead_time=4 and promised=4. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the sustained high-demand regime (regime length >>20, so N capped at 20) so the OR engine forecasts and safety stock reflect recent elevated mean and volatility rather than the tiny early-sample demands. This balances service (avoid stockouts given high pipeline demand) against holding cost by aligning base-stock to recent demand statistics.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_47: confirmed sustained actual lead_time=4 over many concluded periods; demand has been in a sustained high regime since ~Period_5. On-hand=0, in-transit=14681 (sufficient pipeline but arrivals will show in future concludes). Use promised/default lead time to match proven L=4. Forecast demand using recent-window to capture the high-demand regime; choose recent_N with N=20 (captures most recent elevated periods while capping at 20). Use same recent_N window for volatility. These parameters align OR base-stock toward the higher recent mean and elevated variability, balancing service (high profit $2 vs holding $1) while avoiding undercoverage given long lead time and strong recent demand.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained actual lead_time = 4 (arrivals in concluded periods consistently show lead_time=4); New sustained high-demand regime beginning ~Period_5 (elevated demands in Periods 5\u201346 vs earlier periods).

Current period 50. Inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=18207. Concluded history consistently shows actual lead_time=4 (arrivals from orders placed 4 periods earlier across many periods) and a sustained high-demand regime beginning around Period 5 (much larger demands since then). To match observed regime and prioritize service (profit $2 vs holding $1), I use the promised/default lead time (4) and set demand forecast and volatility to recent-window estimates to capture the elevated demand and higher variance observed in the last periods. This keeps orders responsive to the high-demand regime while letting the OR backend compute the appropriate base-stock and cap.
