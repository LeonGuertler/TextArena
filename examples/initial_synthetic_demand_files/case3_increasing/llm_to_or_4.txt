Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. Historical demand samples for chips(Regular) = [112,97,116,138,94], mean=111.4, std\u224815.74. On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no concluded arrivals \u2192 no evidence to override promised lead time. Use promised lead time (default L=2). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean = 3\xd7111.4\u2248334.2 and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std = sqrt(3)\xd715.74\u224827.3. This keeps policy aligned with historical demand and avoids overreacting to missing arrivals (no concluded shipments yet).

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_2 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=141 (ordered Period 1) but Period 1 conclude shows arrived=0 so no concluded arrivals observed \u2014 cannot infer actual lead time yet. Use promised lead time (default) and demand priors from full history ([112,97,116,138,94]) so mu_hat and sigma_hat use default formulas. This keeps the OR engine's base-stock tied to long-run mean while avoiding premature adjustments for a potentially lost or late shipment.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=279 (141+138 ordered in Periods 1\u20132), no concluded arrivals yet so actual lead time is unobserved. Demand history samples = [112,97,116,138,94], mean=111.4. Use promised lead time (default) because no arrival conclussions allow inference of actual lead time; set mu_hat and sigma_hat to default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std with L=promised, balancing service level against holding cost given current uncertainty and large in-transit pipeline.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_4 start. Historical demands = [112,97,116,138,94] (mean=111.4). All three orders placed in Periods 1-3 (141+138+145=424) remain in-transit and have not concluded by Period_3; under promised L=2 the Period_1 order should have concluded by Period_3. This suggests actual lead time has extended by ~1 period. To avoid underordering while shipments are delayed, set L explicit=3 (best estimate: one period longer than promised). Use default demand estimators so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples), leveraging all history until we observe concluded arrivals. This raises target base stock to cover the longer pipeline and balances higher stock vs. holding cost while shipments are unresolved.

Carry-over insight: Lead time appears to have increased: orders from Periods 1-3 (total 424) remained unconcluded through Period_3, implying actual lead-time \u22483 periods (evidence: expected arrival by Period_3 under promised L=2 did not occur).

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=231. Concluded arrivals show lead_times = {3 (P1),2 (P2),1 (P3)} \u2192 average \u22482, so use calculated L to reflect observed regime. Recent demand spiked (Period demands: 246,285,437) vs. historical small-sample baseline, so use EWMA (gamma=0.5) for mu_hat to give substantial weight to recent high demand while retaining prior; use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture increased volatility in the most recent sample window. These choices let the OR backend raise base stock for higher short-term demand and adjust safety stock for elevated variability, while using observed lead-time to avoid under-ordering given past delayed arrivals.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_6: on-hand=0, in-transit=803, recent demands high (history: [112,97,116,138,94] used as seed; recent observed demands in concludes: 91,246,285,437,448). Concluded arrivals show observed lead times of 3,2,1 periods (orders on P1->P4, P2->P4, P3->P4) so average observed lead time \u22482. Pipeline (803) includes multi-period delayed shipments and a large Period_5 order that has not concluded. Risk of further delayed/lost shipments exists. I choose L via "calculate" to let backend use the average of observed lead times (captures varied 1\u20133 period realizations). For demand forecast and volatility I choose "default" for mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) \u2014 this uses full sample set and scales with the inferred lead-time, balancing service level (captures observed longer lead-times) against holding cost given holding=$1 and profit=$2.

Carry-over insight: Observed concluded lead times = 3,2,1 (orders from Periods 1-3); average observed lead time = 2 periods (evidence: Period_4 conclude: P1->3, P2->2, P3->1). Previous inference of \u22483 periods revised to average 2 based on full concluded set.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_7 decision. Recent concluded lead-times = [3,2,1,2,1] (Periods 4 & 6 conclude), average \u22481.8 \u2192 choose calculated L to reflect observed average. Demand has jumped in recent periods (Period4-6 demands = 437, 448, 587) vs earlier samples; use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new higher mean and volatility. Current on-hand=216 + in-transit=145 = 361 units; with promised lead time=2 some in-transit may arrive sooner or later, so using observed average lead-time and recent demand protects service while limiting holding cost. Methods chosen: L="calculate" to use observed lead-time average; mu_hat="recent_N", N=3 to forecast (1+L)*mean of last 3 demands; sigma_hat="recent_N", N=3 to capture recent volatility. This balances higher recent demand against holding cost given limited on-hand+pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime: observed lead-times = [3,2,1,2,1], average \u22481.8 (~2) from Periods 4&6 concluded arrivals; revise promised-only belief to avg\u22482. Demand regime shift: last 3-period mean = 490.7 (Periods 4-6 = 437,448,587), indicating sustained higher demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $432.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_8: recent demand has spiked (Periods 4-7 demands = 437,448,587,637) with last 3-period mean \u2248490.7, and concluded lead-times = [3,2,1,2,1] (Periods 4&6 arrivals) giving average \u22481.8 (~2). On-hand=0, in-transit=774 (large pipeline including possibly overdue/lost earlier orders). I set L=calculate to let the backend use the average of observed concluded lead times (~2) to reflect the longer empirical lead-time regime. For demand I use recent_N (N=3) to capture the new higher-demand regime (last 3 periods) so mu_hat = (1+L)*recent mean. For sigma_hat I use recent_N (N=3) to reflect elevated short-term volatility. These choices prioritize service during the sustained demand surge while keeping volatility estimate tight to recent behavior; using observed lead-times helps avoid under-ordering given past delayed arrivals.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_9: recent demand has surged (Periods 6-8 = 587,637,776). On-hand=0, in-transit=1493. Historical concluded lead-times support average actual L\u22482. Using L estimate via calculate (average observed lead times). Demand forecasting uses recent_N (N=3) to capture the new high-demand regime (most recent three periods mean=666.7 \u2192 (1+L)\xd7mean target). Volatility is set via recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent demand variability. Given pipeline 1493 vs (1+L)*recent_mean \u22482000, parameters aim to raise base-stock to meet higher short-term demand while accounting for holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Recent demand further increased: last 3 periods (P6-8) mean = 666.7, higher than prior 3-period estimate; treat as new high-demand regime.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10: on-hand=0, in-transit=2321. Historical concluded lead-times average \u22482 periods (observed sequence [...,3,2,1,2,1]); shipments recently delayed but average \u22482 so set L to calculated average. Demand has clearly stepped up; use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect very recent high demand (Periods 7-9 demand = 637, 776, 963) so the OR base-stock covers (1+L) periods at the new regime. This balances higher service level needed for surging demand while avoiding overstock from older low-demand data. The large in-transit (2321) will be accounted for by the backend pipeline when computing order quantity.

Carry-over insight: Recent sustained higher demand regime: last 3-period mean (Periods 7-9) = 792 units (637,776,963); treat as new demand baseline.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_11: on-hand=0, in-transit=2985. Historical concluded lead-times = [3,2,1,2,1] \u2192 avg \u22481.8 (~2). Recent demand has shifted sharply upward; most recent demands (Periods 8-10) = [776,963,863], recent mean \u2248867. I set L by 'calculate' to let backend use observed lead-time average rather than promised L=2; mu_hat uses 'recent_N' N=3 to capture the new high-demand regime ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 3 periods). sigma_hat uses 'recent_N' N=3 to reflect current volatility of recent demands. These choices prioritize service for the elevated demand while the large in-transit position will naturally cap new orders via the backend cap, mitigating holding cost risk and addressing potential past delayed arrivals.

Carry-over insight: In-transit=2985 covers ~3.4 periods at recent mean demand (~867), reducing immediate need for new orders.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1656.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_12 context: demand has risen sharply over Periods 6-11 (recent demands: 963, 863, 1136). On-hand=0, in-transit=2357 which covers ~2.4 periods at recent mean demand. Observed concluded lead-times = [3,2,1,2,1,2] \u2192 average \u22481.83 (~2). To capture the realized lead-time regime use calculate (avg observed). To reflect the recent high-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 3 demand periods (N=3) so the OR engine sizes base-stock to meet the elevated short-term demand while pipeline covers part of demand.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime shifted: observed lead-times = [3,2,1,2,1,2], average \u22481.83 (~2); Recent demand regime increased: last 3-period mean = 987.33 (Periods 9-11: 963,863,1136).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1728.00

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13: demand has been rising sharply; recent observed concluded lead-times average \u22482 periods (evidence: concluded arrivals show lead-times 3,2,1,2,1,2,2,1 \u2192 mean \u22481.83). On-hand=0, in-transit=2708 covers multiple recent-period demands, so no emergency ordering. I set L by 'calculate' to let backend use observed lead-time average. For demand I use recent_N (N=3) to capture the new high-demand regime (Periods 10-12 demand = 863,1136,1221 \u2192 recent mean \u22481073.33); mu_hat = (1+L)*recent_mean via backend. Volatility is rising with demand; use sigma recent_N (N=3) so backend scales std over the same window. These choices respond to concluded lead-time evidence (avoid relying on promised L=2 blindly) and anchor forecasts to the most recent high-demand regime while acknowledging substantial in-transit cover.

Carry-over insight: Recent sustained higher demand: last 3-period mean (Periods 10-12 = 863,1136,1221) = 1073.33; treat as new demand baseline.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_14: on-hand=0, in-transit=3879. Observed concluded lead-times across history average \u22481.8 (samples: 3,2,1,2,1,2) \u2014 choose calculate to let backend use observed average. Demand has stepped up recently; last 3 demands (Periods 11-13 = 1136,1221,1246) average \u22481201, so use recent_N N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new high-demand regime. In-transit (3879) \u22483.23 periods of recent demand, so immediate ordering urgency is low; parameters target service under elevated demand while avoiding excess holding given holding cost=$1/unit. Using recent demand for mu/sigma raises the base-stock to cover the higher demand regime and the calculate L accounts for realized lead-time drift and lost-shipment risk.

Carry-over insight: Recent demand regime increased: last 3-period mean (Periods 11-13) = 1201 units; treat as new short-term demand baseline.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_15 decision: recent demand has risen sharply (Periods 12-14 demands = 1221,1246,1265; 3-period mean \u22481244). On-hand=1121, in-transit=1786 (total pipeline=2907) which covers \u22482.34 periods at recent mean, so immediate stock is adequate but demand is elevated. Observed concluded lead-times across history average \u22481.8 (evidence: concluded lead-times include 3,2,1,2,1,2,... across Periods 4-14); use calculated average lead-time. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using most recent 3 periods to capture the new high-demand regime and increased volatility. These choices raise target base-stock to meet higher short-term demand while the existing pipeline reduces urgent ordering, balancing service level against holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime: observed average \u22481.8 (~2) from concluded arrivals (Periods 4-14); Demand regime: sustained higher demand \u2014 recent 3-period mean \u22481244 (Periods 12-14).

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_16: recent concluded arrivals imply actual lead-time ~2 periods (multiple concluded messages with lead-times [3,2,1,2,1,2,1] average \u22481.8\u22482). Demand has stepped up sharply: last 3 demands (Periods 13-15 = 1246,1265,1507) mean \u22481339.3. On-hand=0, in-transit=2774 \u22482.07 periods of recent demand, so near-term receipts provide coverage but demand remains elevated. Set L to calculate (use observed lead-times average) to capture realized lead-time ~2; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N N=3 to anchor forecasts and variability to the new high-demand regime and keep orders responsive while avoiding excess holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime: observed average \u22481.8 (~2) from concluded arrivals (Periods 4-15); Demand regime: sustained high demand \u2014 recent 3-period mean \u22481339 (Periods 13-15); In-transit (~2774) covers ~2.1 periods at recent demand.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17. Recent demand has been elevated (Periods 14-16 demands = 1265,1507,1547; 3-period mean \u22481439.67). Observed concluded lead-times through Period 16 average \u22481.8 (~2). On-hand=0, in-transit=4353 which covers multiple periods of current demand, so avoid aggressive ordering now. Set L to 'calculate' to use average observed lead-times (~2). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to capture the new high-demand regime (focus on most recent 3 periods: 1265,1507,1547). This balances service level for high demand while letting the large pipeline deplete before adding more inventory.

Carry-over insight: In-transit increased to 4353 units, covering \u22483.0 periods at recent 3-period mean demand (~1440); reduces immediate need for new orders.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_18: on-hand=0, in-transit=4834. Historical concluded lead-times (multiple periods) average \u22481.8 (~2); use calculated average lead time to reflect observed regime. Demand has shifted sharply higher recently; last 3 realized demands (Periods 15-17 = 1507,1547,1724) average \u22481592.7, so use recent_N (N=3) to forecast across review+lead window. Use recent_N for sigma to reflect current volatility. These settings let the OR backend size base-stock to cover the elevated short-term demand while the large in-transit (~4834 \u22483.0 periods at recent mean) will reduce new ordering via the pipeline term.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime: observed concluded lead-times average \u22481.8 (~2) from multiple concluded arrivals (evidence: Periods 4-17 concluded lead-times include [3,2,1,2,1,2,...]); Demand regime: sustained high-demand -- recent 3-period mean (Periods 15-17) \u22481592.7; In-transit large (4834) currently covers ~3 periods at this recent demand.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period_19: recent demand is high (Periods 16-18 demands = 1547,1724,1802; 3-period mean \u22481691). On-hand=1058, In-transit=2389 \u2192 pipeline+on-hand=3447 \u22482.04 periods of demand at recent mean, so no urgent emergency order. Observed concluded lead-times across history average \u22481.8 (~2). To capture the empirically-observed lead-time regime use calculated average lead time. To ensure the OR engine targets current high demand, set demand forecast using the most recent short-run regime (recent 3 periods) and estimate volatility from the same window. These parameters balance service level (capture recent demand spike) against holding cost given substantial pipeline inventory.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_20: recent demand has risen sharply; last 3-period mean demand = (1724+1802+2075)/3 = 1867.0. Historical concluded lead-times across many arrivals average \u22481.8 (~2). On-hand=0, in-transit=4295 covers ~2.3 periods at recent demand, so we should use a lead-time estimate reflecting observed arrivals and set mu/sigma from the recent high-demand regime. Set L using observed lead-times (calculate) to capture the \u22482-period actual lead time; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=3) to reflect the new demand baseline and recent volatility, which keeps base-stock responsive to elevated demand while recognizing pipeline coverage to avoid excess holding cost.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Period 21. On-hand=348, In-transit=3827. Historical concluded lead-times (Periods 4-20) = [3,2,1,2,1,2,2,1,2,1,1,3,2,2,1], average \u22481.73 (~1.8\u21922). Recent demand has been high; last 3 realized demands (Periods 18-20) = [1802,2075,1973], mean=1950. Lead-time inference: use averaged observed lead time (calculate) to reflect actual ~1.7\u20132. Decision choices: L set via "calculate" to capture observed \u22481.7 periods; mu_hat set via recent_N (N=3) to target (1+L)\xd7recent high demand; sigma_hat set via recent_N (N=3) to capture recent volatility.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23: on-hand=0, in-transit=4619. Historical concluded lead-times average \u22481.8 (~2) across many arrivals \u2014 use averaged observed lead time to capture real regime. Demand has moved to a much higher level recently; last 3 concluded demands (Periods 20-22 = 1973,1983,2221) mean \u22482059. To match OR engine expectation of (1+L) demand horizon while reacting to current high demand, set L by calculating observed lead times, set mu_hat using recent 3-period mean (scaled by 1+L by backend), and capture short-term volatility with recent 3-period std. This balances service (high recent demand) vs holding (large in-transit already covering ~2.24 periods), letting backend cap orders appropriately.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime: observed average lead-time \u22481.8 (~2) from concluded arrivals (use averaged observed lead time); Recent demand regime elevated: last 3-period mean (Periods 20-22) \u22482059; In-transit=4619 covers \u22482.24 periods at this recent demand, reducing immediate urgency for new arrivals.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24: on-hand=0, in-transit=6673 units; recent demand has been elevated (recent 3-period mean used to capture current high-demand regime). Observed concluded lead-times average \u22481.8 (~2) across history, so use calculated average lead time to reflect real-world arrival patterns. Use recent 3-period demand to set mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets current high-demand baseline while accounting for recent volatility; with large pipeline this prevents aggressive additional ordering but ensures service vs holding tradeoff.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_25: recent concluded lead-times consistently average ~1.8 (~2) \u2014 use observed-average to capture actual regime; demand has shifted sharply up (last 5-period mean ~2218 units). On-hand=0, in-transit=4882 covers ~2.2 periods at this recent demand, lowering immediate urgency but risk of stockout next period if no pipeline replenishment. Set L to calculated average of observed lead times to reflect empirical ~2-period regime. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to anchor the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility to the new high-demand regime so the OR backend raises target base-stock and safety stock appropriately while respecting cap.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime: observed concluded lead-times average \u22481.8 (~2) (evidence: multiple concluded arrivals across periods show lead-times [3,2,1,2,1,2,...]); Demand regime: sustained elevated demand \u2014 recent 5-period mean \u22482218 (Periods 20-24: 1973,1983,2221,2326,2566).

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 26 decision. On-hand=0, in-transit=6384. Historical concluded lead-times average \u22481.8 (~2) across many concluded arrivals; use calculated average lead time to reflect observed regime. Demand has risen sharply recently \u2014 last 3 realized demands (Periods 23-25 = 2326,2566,2604) show a short-term mean \u22482498.7; use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so OR base-stock reflects the new high-demand regime while keeping variance anchored to the most recent volatility. In-transit (~6384) currently covers multiple periods at this recent demand, reducing urgency to order but parameters should target service given high profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27: on-hand=1765, in-transit=3680. Recent demand has been very high and stable: last 3 demands (Periods 24-26) = [2566,2604,2645], mean \u22482605. Historical concluded lead-times consistently average \u22481.8 (~2). I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses observed average lead-time from concluded arrivals (captures the ~1.8\u21922 regime). For demand I use recent_N with N=3 to anchor mu_hat to the very recent high-demand regime ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 3 samples). sigma_hat left as 'default' to use full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances service (respond to strong recent demand) while recognizing substantial pipeline (in-transit covers ~1.4 periods of recent demand) to avoid over-ordering.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_28: on-hand=0, in-transit=7246. Historical concluded lead-times average \u22481.8 (~2) so use observed-based L. Recent demand is markedly higher: last 3 demands (Periods 25-27) = [2604,2645,2890], mean \u22482713. In-transit (7246) covers ~2.67 periods at this recent demand, reducing urgent need to order but we must set forecast to elevated demand to avoid stockouts when some in-transit may be delayed or lost. Chosen methods: L by calculation to reflect observed lead-time average from concluded arrivals; mu_hat recent_N (N=3) to capture the new high-demand regime (uses (1+L)*mean of last 3 demands); sigma_hat recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent volatility. This balances service (higher base-stock) against holding cost given large pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Recent demand regime increased: last 3-period mean (Periods 25-27 = 2604,2645,2890) = 2713; treat as new short-term demand baseline.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period_29: recent demand is elevated (last 3 demands ~2645,2890,2643 \u2192 mean \u22482726). On-hand=0, In-transit=8844 \u2192 covers \u22483.24 periods at this recent demand, reducing immediate urgency. Observed concluded lead-times across history average \u22481.8 (~2). I set L=calculate to let backend use observed average lead time; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N (N=3) to anchor forecasts/volatility to the new high-demand short-term regime and avoid diluting with older low-demand data. This balances service (capture current high demand) versus holding cost (large pipeline already covering ~3 periods), so orders won't aggressively overshoot.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime: observed average lead-time \u22481.8 (~2) from concluded arrivals; Recent demand regime increased: short-term mean (Periods 26-28) \u22482726 units, treat as new short-term baseline.

Observed concluded lead-times across history average \u22481.8 (~2); use data-driven average to reflect actual regime. Set L via calculate to let backend use observed lead-time history; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to anchor forecasts/uncertainty on the current high-demand regime and avoid being pulled by older low-demand samples.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_31: on-hand=0, in-transit=8589. Recent demand (Periods 28-30) = [2643,2814,2873], 3-period mean \u22482776.7, indicating sustained high demand. Observed concluded lead-times across history average \u22481.8 (~2). I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses average observed lead time from concluded arrivals. I set mu_hat to recent_N with N=3 to target current short-term demand ((1+L)\xd7recent mean). I set sigma_hat to default so backend scales historical volatility by sqrt(1+L). With large in-transit (~8589 \u22483.09 periods of demand at recent mean), this balances avoiding excess ordering while preserving service given ~2-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime: observed average lead-time \u22481.8 (~2) from concluded arrivals; Recent short-term demand baseline: last 3-period mean (P28-30) \u22482776.7; In-transit=8589 covers \u22483.09 periods at this recent mean, reducing immediate ordering urgency.

On-hand=3, in-transit=6723 (~2.31 periods coverage at recent mean), so immediate ordering urgency is low. Lead-time inference: multiple concluded arrivals give avg observed lead-time \u22481.8 (~2) \u2014 use averaged observed lead time. For demand forecast use recent 3-period mean to capture the new high-demand regime; use recent 3-period std for volatility.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34: on-hand=0, in-transit=8595 covering ~2.7 periods at very recent demand. Observed concluded lead-times across history average \u22481.8 (~2) with multiple concluded arrivals showing [3,2,1,2,1,2,...]; use calculated/observed lead-time. Demand has clearly shifted to a higher regime recently \u2014 most recent 3-period mean (Periods 31-33 = 3046,3005,3391) \u22483147.3, so forecast over review+lead should use a recent-3 estimate. Volatility is also best estimated from the same recent window. These choices (L via calculate, mu_hat recent_N N=3, sigma_hat recent_N N=3) let the OR backend size base-stock to cover the elevated short-term demand while respecting the empirically observed ~2-period lead time and recent variability; large in-transit reduces immediate ordering urgency so we rely on recent short-term stats rather than all-time averages.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime: observed concluded lead-times average \u22481.8 (~2) from multiple concluded arrivals (evidence: concluded lead-times include recurring pattern [3,2,1,2,1,2,...]); Recent demand regime elevated: last 3-period mean (Periods 31-33) \u22483147.3, in-transit=8595 covers \u22482.7 periods at this recent mean, reducing immediate urgency for new orders.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 35: on-hand=0, in-transit=7604. Historical concluded lead-times repeatedly average ~1.8 (~2); recent demand (Periods 32-34 = 3005,3391,3368) is elevated with 3-period mean \u22483254.67. In-transit (~7604) covers ~2.3 periods at this recent demand, so immediate ordering urgency is moderate. Set L to 'calculate' to use observed average lead-time; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=3) to anchor forecasts to the very recent high-demand regime, balancing service level vs holding cost given large pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime: observed average lead-time \u22481.8 (~2) from concluded arrivals; Recent demand regime elevated: last 3-period mean (Periods 32-34) \u22483254.67, in-transit=7604 covers \u22482.3 periods at this recent mean.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36: on-hand=0, in-transit=10609. Concluded arrivals across history show recurring lead-times [3,2,1,2,1,2,...]; average observed lead time \u22481.8 (~2). Recent demand is elevated: last 3 realized demands (Periods 33-35) = [3391,3368,3282], 3-period mean \u22483347. I set L to 'calculate' to let backend use the average of observed concluded lead-times. I use mu_hat recent_N with N=3 to target the current high short-term demand regime (backend will compute (1+L)*mean of last 3 samples). I set sigma_hat recent_N with N=3 to capture current demand volatility. These choices align ordering to the elevated recent demand while acknowledging observed ~2-period lead time and the large in-transit balance (which reduces immediate urgency).

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime: observed concluded lead-times average \u22481.8 (~2) from multiple concluded arrivals; Recent demand regime: short-term 3-period mean (Periods 33-35) \u22483347; In-transit=10609 covers \u22483.17 periods at this recent mean, lowering immediate ordering urgency.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:

Historical concluded arrivals show observed lead-times averaging \u22481.8 (~2) across many periods. To reflect the empirical lead-time while avoiding over-ordering given a large in-transit pipeline, I use calculated lead-time (backend to average observed lead-times) and base demand estimates on the most recent short-term regime (last 3 periods). Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat keeps the forecast and volatility aligned to the current high-demand regime and lets the OR engine cap orders given pipeline, minimizing excess holding cost while preserving service.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 38: on-hand=0, in-transit=9229. Historical concluded lead-times show recurring pattern [3,2,1,2,1,2,...] with average \u22481.8 (~2) \u2014 use observed-average approach to capture this. Demand has been in a high, rising regime recently; use recent 3-period demand to reflect current elevated demand and keep responsiveness. Parameters chosen: L by calculate to reflect observed lead-time average; mu_hat recent_N N=3 to size (1+L)-period demand using the most recent short-term baseline; sigma_hat recent_N N=3 to reflect recent volatility. This balances service (capture shorter-than-promised but variable lead times) against holding cost given large in-transit inventory (9229) which already covers multiple periods at the recent demand estimate.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39: demand has been very high recently (multi-periods in the 3000s); on-hand=0, in-transit=7944 (~2.5\u20133 periods of recent demand). Concluded lead-times historically average \u22481.8 (~2); use averaged observed lead time to capture that. To target current high-demand regime, forecast demand across review+lead using the most recent 3 periods (captures the latest surge) and match volatility to the same window. These settings keep orders responsive to elevated demand while the large in-transit stock tempers immediate ordering.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40: demand has been in a sustained high regime (recent demands P37-39 = 3748, 3929, 4212). On-hand=0, In-transit=12052 (~3.0 periods cover at recent demand ~3963) so immediate urgency is reduced. Observed concluded lead-times across history average \u22481.8 (~2); use the backend's lead-time inference rather than forcing promised=2. Set L to 'calculate' so backend averages observed lead times. For demand forecasting use a short recent window to capture the new high-demand regime: mu_hat recent_N N=3 ((1+L)*mean of last 3 demands). Volatility is best estimated from the same recent window: sigma_hat recent_N N=3. These choices let the OR engine size base stock to reflect the current high-demand level while recognizing in-transit coverage and observed lead-time behavior, balancing service level vs holding cost.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 41: on-hand=0, in-transit=13215. Concluded arrivals across history show variable lead-times with average \u22481.8 (~2); several late/nonconcluded shipments occurred earlier but recent concluded pattern centers on 2. Demand has clearly ramped to a high regime in recent periods. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses observed average lead-time (captures ~1.8\u21922). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N with N=3 to anchor forecast and volatility to the most recent high-demand behavior (short horizon demand drives ordering given large in-transit). This balances service (capture recent spikes) while relying on in-transit cover to avoid over-ordering.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:

In-transit (~14040) covers \u22483.4 periods at this recent mean, so immediate urgency to order is reduced. Observed concluded lead-times across history average \u22481.8 (~2); use calculated average lead-time to let backend reconcile historical lead-time variability. Set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to anchor forecast to the current high-demand regime. Set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture recent volatility. These choices bias the OR engine toward stocking for the current elevated demand while letting the backend use observed lead-time statistics to size safety stock; large in-transit reduces near-term ordering pressure.

To reflect that regime and recent high demand, set L based on observed average lead-times, and set demand forecast/volatility from the most recent 3 periods (captures the current elevated demand level and short-term variance). This avoids over-ordering while the large in-transit pipeline already provides multi-period cover; using recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat aligns base-stock to current demand spikes and lets the OR backend size safety stock appropriately given the inferred L.

Demand has been in a sustained high regime recently (sharp upward trend across many periods). To balance service vs holding given large pipeline, set L to be estimated from observed history (average observed lead time) so backend accounts for actual delays; set mu_hat from the most recent short-term demand (captures current elevated baseline); set sigma_hat from recent variability to reflect current volatility and avoid under-ordering during spikes.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime: observed average lead-time \u22481.8 (~2) from multiple concluded arrivals (evidence: recurring concluded lead-times [3,2,1,2,1,2,...]). Demand regime: sustained elevated demand \u2014 use recent short-term mean (last 3 periods) as current baseline.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47: on-hand=0, in-transit=13058. Historical concluded lead-times average \u22481.8 (~2) across many concluded arrivals; demand clearly in a high regime \u2014 recent 3 periods (Periods 44-46) demands = [4444,4364,4530], 3-period mean \u2248 4446. Use inferred average lead-time (backend 'calculate') and set demand forecast based on the most recent short-term regime (recent_N=3) so mu_hat covers (1+L) periods of that elevated demand. Use recent_N=3 for sigma_hat so volatility reflects current high-demand variability. These choices avoid overreacting to older low-demand samples while ensuring pipeline + in-transit are measured against current high demand.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 48: on-hand=0, in-transit=14823. Historical concluded lead-times repeatedly average \u22481.8 (~2); several late arrivals observed but overall mean ~2. Set L to calculate so backend uses observed lead-time average. Demand has been in a sustained high regime; use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture current short-term baseline (Periods 45-47 demands = 4364,4530,4595). Use recent_N (N=3) for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility. The large in-transit stock (~14823) covers multiple periods at this recent demand, so parameters anchored to recent demand avoid over-ordering while the backend's capped policy limits order size.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_49: on-hand=0, in-transit=15024 (covers multiple periods at current high demand). Historical concluded lead-times repeatedly average \u22481.8 (~2). Demand has been elevated recently; use short-term recent demand estimates to size review+lead demand while using observed lead-time average. Choosing L='calculate' to let backend use observed lead times; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N (N=3) to capture the latest high-demand regime and keep orders responsive given large in-transit balance.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime: observed concluded lead-times average \u22481.8 (~2) from many concluded arrivals; Recent demand regime: sustained elevated demand \u2014 use recent short-term mean (last 3 periods) as current baseline.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 50: on-hand=1188, in-transit=9217. Historical concluded lead-times average \u22481.8 (~2) \u2014 use observed-average (calculate) to capture slight deviation from promised L=2. Recent demand has been rising sharply; use short-term recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to reflect current elevated demand (last 3 demands \u22484595,4776,5087 -> mean\u22484819). Pipeline (10405) covers \u22482.16 periods at this recent mean, reducing immediate ordering urgency. sigma_hat left as default to let backend scale volatility from full history with sqrt(1+L). These choices bias orders toward meeting current high demand while avoiding excess holding given large in-transit.
