Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start, no on-hand or in-transit and no conclude history to infer lead time. Use promised lead time (default L=0). Demand history (5 samples mean=111.4, std\u224815.74) shows no clear changepoint and no calendar news provided, so use default estimators to set mu_hat and sigma_hat for (1+L) review+lead period.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
No news/seasonality. Promised lead time is 0 and Period 1 conclude shows an arrival with lead_time=0, so use L=0. Include Period 1 demand (91) with prior five samples to update demand moments. Mean demand across 6 samples = 108.0 -> mu_hat = (1+L)*mean = 108.0. Sample std across 6 samples \u2248 17.809 -> sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std = 17.809. These settings keep the OR base-stock responsive to the slightly lower recent mean while maintaining measured variability for service-level calculation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $232.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
No overdue shipments; both concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 (Period1 and Period2). Historical demand samples = [112,97,116,138,94] give mean=111.4 and std\u224817.61. Period2 had a one-off large observed demand (246) but no evidence of a sustained regime shift yet. Use average observed lead time (0) and default demand/volatility formulas to keep policy stable while avoiding overreaction to the single large demand spike.

Daily Reward (R_t): $304.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent concluded periods show a clear uptick in demand starting Period 2 (demands: 91, 246, 285) vs prior baseline (~112 mean). All concluded arrivals indicate actual lead_time=0. I therefore set L to the average observed lead time (0). For demand I use a recent_N=3 estimate to capture the new high-demand regime (Periods 1-3 concluded), giving mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last3)=207.3333 units. Volatility uses recent_N=3 (sample std) to reflect increased variance: sigma_hat = 102.647.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift upward starting Period 2: mean(last3 concluded demands)=207.33, elevated variance (std\u2248102.65).

Daily Reward (R_t): $504.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent concl. history (Periods1-4) shows large, sustained demand increase starting Period2: concluded demands = [91,246,285,437]; last 3 = [246,285,437], mean=322.6667, std\u2248100.93. All concluded orders reported lead_time=0, so use average observed lead time = 0. Because of the clear upward regime since Period2, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 (regime length=3) so the OR engine targets higher base-stock to avoid heavy lost sales; sigma set to recent volatility to avoid overconfidence and limit excessive holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shifted upward starting Period 2: mean(last3 concluded demands)=322.67, std(last3)=100.93.

Daily Reward (R_t): $734.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
All concluded lead-times = 0 \u2192 keep L=0. Demand shows sustained upward regime since Period 2 (recent demands 285, 437, 448); use recent_N=3 to capture current elevated mean and volatility. mu_hat set to (1+L)*mean(last3)=390 to provide coverage for expected demand this period; sigma_hat set from last3 sample volatility (std\u224891.1) to size safety stock against observed variability. This raises target base-stock to preserve service during the higher-demand regime while limiting excess holding given holding cost=$1/unit.

Daily Reward (R_t): $860.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 (periods 1\u20136). Recent demand has jumped and is sustained: last 3 concluded demands (Periods 4\u20136) = [437,448,587], mean=490.6667, std(sample)=83.6579. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must cover next period demand; use L estimated from observed lead times (0). Set mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the new high-demand regime (1+L)*mean_last3 = 490.6667. Set sigma_hat from last3 (sqrt(1+L)*sample_std = 83.6579) so OR backend raises base-stock and cap appropriately to avoid stockouts while recognizing higher variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift upward starting Period 2 confirmed; recent mean(last3 concluded demands, Periods4-6)=490.67, sample_std(last3)=83.66.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Concluded history shows all past orders arrived with lead_time=0 (Periods 1\u20137). Demand has shifted up and remains elevated (recent demands 437\u2013637), but no new changepoint beyond that. Use promised lead time (default). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat from all concluded demand samples (Periods 1\u20137) to let OR backend compute base-stock given persistent high demand.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Observed concluded arrivals show lead_time = 0 in all concluded periods, so use promised L=0. Demand has clearly shifted up; use most recent 3 concluded demands (Periods 6-8: 587, 637, 776) to capture current regime. Set mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last3) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(last3) to align the OR base-stock with recent elevated demand and moderate volatility, balancing service level vs holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains in elevated regime; recent mean(last3 concluded demands, Periods6-8)=666.67, sample_std(last3)=97.92.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1418.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Concluded history shows lead_time=0 each period. Demand is in an elevated regime (starting Period 2); most recent concluded demands (Periods 7-9 = 637, 776, 963) are representative. To match the current regime and prioritize service given high profit/holding ratio, set L to promised (0) and forecast using recent_N=3 (Periods7-9) for mean and std. This yields mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_recent = 792.0 and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*sample_std_recent = 163.613. These parameters raise the base-stock to cover the high recent demand while keeping holding risk explicit.

Carry-over insight: Elevated demand regime since Period 2 confirmed; recent mean(last3 concluded demands, Periods7-9)=792.0, sample_std(last3)=163.613.

This sets mu_hat=(1+L)*mean_recent to prioritize service during high demand while sigma_hat reflects recent variability to size safety stock.

To prioritize service and avoid stockouts in this high-demand regime, set demand forecast using the most recent regime (last 3 concluded demands). Use recent_N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets the elevated mean while reflecting current variability.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
On-hand=0, in-transit=0. All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 \u2014 use promised/default L=0. Demand is in the elevated regime (confirmed by recent concluded demands); use recent_N=3 (Periods 11-13 concluded demands = [1136,1221,1246]) to capture current mean/volatility. mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_recent = 1201.0 to cover one-period demand; sigma_hat = std_recent = 57.672 (sqrt(1+L)*sample_std). These parameters raise the base-stock to meet high recent demand while sigma captures modest variability to limit excess holding given holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Updated confirmed elevated demand: recent mean(last3 concluded, Periods11-13)=1201.0, sample_std(last3)=57.67 (lead_time still 0).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent concluded history shows a sustained, large upward demand regime (Period 2 onward). All concluded lead-times = 0, so keep promised lead time. Use recent 3-period demand to capture current elevated level (Periods 12-14: 1221,1246,1265 -> mean=1244) and low short-run volatility (std\u224822) so OR base-stock matches elevated demand while avoiding excess holding cost.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Demand remains in elevated regime since Period 2; most recent concluded demands (Periods 13-15 = 1246,1265,1507) show a new higher level. Lead time history shows arrivals same-period consistently \u2192 keep L=promised (0). To capture the new regime I use recent_N (N=3) for demand: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last3 concluded) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(last3 concluded). This raises target base-stock to meet current demand spikes while sigma_hat preserves buffer for variability, balancing service level vs holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Elevated demand persists; recent mean(last3 concluded, Periods13-15)=1339.33, sample_std(last3)=145.48.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent concluded history shows persistent elevated demand (Periods 14-16 demands = 1265,1507,1547). On-hand and in-transit are 0 so we must order to cover immediate demand. Observed lead times have been 0 in concluded messages so keep L = promised (0). Use recent_N (N=3) for demand statistics to capture current elevated regime: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last3 concluded demands) = 1439.6667 to target current demand; sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(last3) = 152.5842 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters bias the OR base-stock toward meeting high current demand while the holding cost is moderate (holding=$1, profit=$2).

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0; on-hand=0 and in-transit=0 but demand has been rising sharply. Use L=default (promised=0). For demand I use recent_N (N=3) to capture the latest elevated regime (Periods16-18) so the OR base-stock reacts quickly: mean(last3)=1691.0, sample std(last3)=130.672. This raises mu_hat to cover the upcoming period's demand while sigma_hat reflects recent volatility to set safety stock accordingly.

Carry-over insight: Elevated demand increased further: recent mean(last3 concluded, Periods16-18)=1691.0, sample_std(last3)=130.67.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Demand remains in the elevated regime; recent concluded demands (Periods 17-19 = 1724, 1802, 2075) show a strong upward level. Lead time history shows arrivals each period with lead_time=0, so keep promised L=0.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent concluded periods show a persistent, elevated demand regime (Periods 19-21 demands = 2075, 1973, 1983) and actual lead time has consistently been 0. Use lead time = promised (0). Forecast demand using the most recent 3 concluded demands to capture the current regime; this yields mu_hat = mean(last3) and sigma_hat = sample std(last3). These parameters align the OR base-stock to meet very high current demand while keeping holding cost considered via sigma for safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead_time=0; elevated demand regime persists since ~Period 2; recent mean(last3 concluded, Periods19-21)=2010.33, sample_std(last3)=56.24.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:

Actual lead_time confirmed 0 in concluded history. Demand remains in elevated regime; use most recent 3 concluded demands (Periods 20-22) to capture current level and volatility.

Set mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) => (1+L)*mean(last3 concluded demands) to target current demand; set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=3) => sqrt(1+L)*sample_std(last3) to reflect observed volatility. This keeps service high while limiting excess holding given holding cost = $1 and profit = $2.

Recent concluded demand remains in elevated regime; last3 concluded demands (Periods22-24) = [2221,2326,2566], mean=2371.0, sample_std\u2248176.79.

Set mu_hat using recent_N=3 to focus the base-stock on the most recent elevated regime (mu_hat=(1+L)*mean_recent=2371.0). Set sigma_hat using recent_N=3 to reflect observed short-term variability (sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std_recent\u2248176.79).

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent concluded demand remains in the elevated regime. All concluded arrivals show actual lead_time=0. Use recent 3-period demand to reflect the current level and volatility (Periods 23-25 demands = [2326,2566,2604]). This keeps base-stock responsive to the latest upward trend while avoiding older lower samples diluting the forecast.

Carry-over insight: Elevated demand persists; recent mean(last3 concluded, Periods23-25)=2498.67, sample_std(last3)=150.74; actual lead_time=0.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show actual lead_time=0 consistently and demand is in the elevated regime (recent concluded demands high). I set L to promised/default (0) since concluded history confirms 0. For demand I use recent_N with N=3 (most recent concluded demands Periods24-26) to capture current elevated regime. mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last3 concluded) = 2605.0. sigma_hat uses recent_N sample std (n-1) scaled by sqrt(1+L) = 39.506 (captures low recent volatility). These parameters aim to keep pipeline \u2248 current high demand while avoiding excess holding cost given confirmed same-period arrivals.

Use recent_N=3 to capture current elevated regime and keep L=0 (promised).

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Lead time confirmed 0 from concluded history. Elevated demand regime persists (recent strong upward trend). Last 3 concluded demands (Periods 33-35) = [3391, 3368, 3282], mean=3347.0, sample_std\u224857.45. On-hand=66, in-transit=0 \u2192 large gap vs expected demand this period. Set L=0 (explicit). Forecast demand across review+lead (1+L) using recent_N=3 to capture current elevated regime: mu_hat=(1+0)*3347.0=3347.0. Use recent_N=3 volatility: sigma_hat=sqrt(1+0)*57.45=57.45. These parameters bias the OR base-stock toward satisfying high current demand while sigma captures low relative variability, reducing excessive safety stock given holding cost.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Actual lead_time repeatedly confirmed 0 in concluded history through Period 37. Recent demand regime is elevated and stable; carry-over shows recent mean of last3 concluded demands (Periods34-36)=3366.0 with sample_std\u224883.03. I set L to promised (0) and use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the latest regime and keep safety stock aligned with current volatility. This targets service while avoiding excess holding given holding cost=$1 and profit=$2 (q=2/(2+1)=0.6667).

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_39 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Concluded history consistently shows actual lead_time=0; demand has been rising\u2014last 3 concluded demands (Periods36-38) = [3448,3748,3929], mean=3708.333. To track the current elevated regime I use recent_N=3 for demand forecasts. With L=0, mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_recent = 3708.333. Sample std (n-1) over last 3 = 243.000 -> sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std_recent = 243.0. These parameters align orders to the current high-demand regime while keeping holding exposure minimal because lead time is confirmed 0.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent concluded demands (Periods 37-39 = 3748, 3929, 4212) confirm the elevated demand regime; carry-over history shows sustained elevation since ~Period 2. All concluded arrivals indicate actual lead_time=0. I use recent_N=3 to capture the most recent demand level while keeping responsiveness high. Setting L based on observed lead times (calculate \u2192 0) keeps arrivals same-period. mu_hat uses recent 3-period mean (1+L)*mean = 3963.0. sigma_hat uses recent 3-period sample std * sqrt(1+L) = 233.789... to reflect the recent volatility.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_41: actual lead_time has been consistently 0 in concluded history; demand remains in the elevated regime (very large recent demands). Use lead time = promised (0). Set demand forecast using the most recent short window (last 3 concluded demands) to capture current elevated level and recent volatility so OR will target high service while capping orders per its cap rule.

Carry-over insight: Elevated demand regime persists; recent mean(last3 concluded, Periods38-40)=4200.6667, sample_std(last3)=266.0601; actual lead_time=0.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_43: on-hand=309, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm actual lead_time=0 and a sustained elevated demand regime. I use recent_N (last 3 concluded demands Periods40-42 = [4461,4166,4040]) to capture current demand level and volatility. Chosen L=0 (explicit) since concluded messages consistently show lead_time=0. mu_hat set as recent_N (N=3): (1+L)*mean(last3)=4222.333333. sigma_hat set as recent_N (N=3): sqrt(1+L)*sample_std(last3)=216.135 (sample std \u2248216.135). This keeps the base-stock responsive to the high current demand while avoiding overreaction to older low-demand history.

Lead time has been consistently observed = 0 in concluded history. To match the OR engine's base-stock inputs while avoiding excess holding, I use L=0 (promised/confirmed), set mu_hat using the recent 3-period mean (1+L)*mean to capture the current regime, and set sigma_hat from the same recent-3 sample std scaled by sqrt(1+L).

This gives mu_hat = mean(last3) and sigma_hat = sample std(last3). Keeping L=promised (0) avoids introducing artificial pipeline.
