Reconciliation and decision: With profit=$2 and holding=$1, the OR critical fractile q=2/(2+1)=0.6667 leads to moderate safety stock; OR's capped suggestion (138) is consistent with the math and smooths order volatility. Risks and reasoning: We currently have only 141 units in transit toward a 5-period (L+1) demand of \u2248557 \u2014 a large shortfall remains, but ordering more now mainly increases pipeline that will only arrive after the (promised) lead time; there is no evidence yet of lost shipments beyond the single pending order. Given no concluded arrivals to update actual lead time and no calendar/seasonal signals to suggest a regime shift, I follow OR's capped, conservative order to avoid over-ordering and excessive holding cost while replenishing pipeline.
