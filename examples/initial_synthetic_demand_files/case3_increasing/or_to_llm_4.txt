That means actual lead time is >=1 and could be the promised 4 or longer; we cannot yet confirm any arrivals. Inventory & pipeline: On-hand = 0, in-transit = 574 (orders from Periods 1\u20134). Historical demand: two possible views \u2014 (a) the provided historical sample for modeling [112,97,116,138,94] \u2192 single-period mean \u2248111.4, 5-period mean \u03bc\u0302\u2248557 (1+L=5); or (b) realized recent demands in concludes (91,246,285,437) show a strong upward spike but may reflect a short-term regime shift. OR recommendation (377) is based on promised L=4 and historical demand; it aims to refill to a base-stock but caps fluctuations. Decision logic: With in-transit=574 which already \u2248 the 5-period demand implied by the historical sample (\u03bc\u0302\u2248557), placing additional orders now would create avoidable holding cost while we still have significant pipeline that may still arrive. Risk tradeoffs: If many in-transit units are lost (no conclude later), we may stock out \u2014 but we have no confirmed evidence of lost shipments yet (no concluded arrivals expected until later periods). Given high holding cost ($1/unit/period) versus profit ($2), and the uncertainty about true lead time, I take a conservative stance: do not order now and wait one more period for concluded arrival information (we should observe whether any of the in-transit arrives in a future conclude).
