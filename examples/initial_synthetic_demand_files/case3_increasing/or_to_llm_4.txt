{
  "rationale": "Observations: on-hand=0, in-transit=18100. Recent demand (Periods 40\u201349) averages \u22484500 units/period, so (L+1)=3 periods' demand \u224813,500 units. Pipeline (18100) > 3-period coverage, so no immediate replenishment required. Lead time has been variable (1\u20133), but in-transit volume provides buffer against 1\u20133 period arrival delays. Holding cost ($1/unit/period) vs profit ($4) favors avoiding excess stock buildup. OR recommends 0; I accept it because pipeline covers required safety horizon and ordering now risks unnecessary holding costs given stable high demand and large in-transit balance. Final action: order 0 units for chips(Regular).",
