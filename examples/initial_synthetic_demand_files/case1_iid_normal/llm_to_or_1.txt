Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1. Recent demand samples: [112,97,116,138,94], mean=111.4 \u2014 no concluded arrivals yet; on-hand=0, in-transit=0 so pipeline short. Promised lead time=2 with no evidence to the contrary; use default lead time. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample, ensuring the base-stock targets coverage over the review+lead horizon and balances profit ($2) vs holding ($1). This approach is conservative given zero inventory and no late-arrival signals.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_2: on-hand=0, in-transit=141 (order from Period_1). Historical demands = [112,97,116,138,94] (mean=111.4). The Period_1 conclude shows the Period_1 order has not arrived yet (arrived=0), so no concluded lead-time evidence beyond the promised lead time. I therefore keep L at the promised default=2. Using default demand aggregation over the (1+L) review+lead horizon captures typical demand (3\xd7mean). Sigma uses default scaling to reflect uncertainty over the 3-period horizon. This balances service (reasonable cover for 3 periods) against holding cost given moderate holding cost and a current in-transit order.

Carry-over insight: Order of 141 units placed in Period_1 has not concluded by Period_1 conclude (arrived=0); treat as delayed/larger lead-time risk until an arrival conclude is observed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3 start. Historical demand samples = [112,97,116,138,94], mean=111.4, sd\u224815.74. Two recent orders (Period_1:141, Period_2:137) have not concluded (arrived=0) \u2192 elevated lead-time / lost-shipment risk. I set L explicitly to 3 to be conservative versus promised 2 given consecutive non-arrivals. With L=3, I compute demand across review+lead as (1+L)\xd7mean =4\xd7111.4=445.6 and set mu_hat explicit to 445.6. Volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L): sd\xd72\u224831.48, set sigma_hat explicit to 31.48. These choices raise target base-stock to buffer against delayed arrivals while keeping variability explicit so the OR engine can cap orders appropriately.

Carry-over insight: Period_2: Orders placed in Period_1 (141 units) and Period_2 (137 units) both not concluded by their conclude messages; treat as sustained elevated lead-time/loss risk until an arrival conclude is observed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 start. Recent concludes show three consecutive orders (Period1:141, P2:137, P3:138) with arrived=0 \u2014 strong evidence actual lead time > promised 2 or possible lost shipments. On-hand=0, in-transit=416 (these units have not concluded). To be conservative and cover extra delay risk, set lead time explicit to 3 periods. Use default demand aggregation for mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples [112,97,116,138,94], matching the chosen L and letting OR engine produce base-stock balancing profit vs holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Elevated lead-time/loss risk: orders from Period1-Period3 (141,137,138) all arrived=0 in their conclude messages \u2192 inferred actual lead time > promised 2 or shipment losses; treat lead time as extended until an arrival conclude is observed.

Daily Profit: $248.00, Daily Holding Cost: $154.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $94.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period: Period_5. Recent concl.: Period_4 showed arrivals: P1 order (141) arrived with lead_time=3, P2 order (137) arrived lead_time=2; P3 (138) still outstanding \u2192 evidence of variable/extended lead times and potential lost/delayed shipments. On-hand=154, in-transit=168. I choose L=calculate to let backend use the average of observed lead times (captures observed 3 and 2). For demand forecast and volatility use default formulas ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) to rely on full-sample stability given limited data while letting L reflect extended lead times. These settings increase pipeline coverage to reduce stockouts from delayed arrivals while keeping forecast anchored to historical demand.

Carry-over insight: Observed lead times: Period_4 conclude \u2192 P1 lead_time=3, P2 lead_time=2; average observed lead_time=2.5. Evidence of variable/extended lead times and at least one delayed shipment (P3 still outstanding). Treat lead time as elevated/unstable until further concludes.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6. Recent demands = [112,97,116,138,94] (mean=111.4). Concluded arrivals show variable/extended lead times: P1 lead_time=3, P2=2, P3 still outstanding \u2192 average observed lead_time \u22482.5. On-hand=103, in-transit=299 (large pipeline but one order still overdue). To reflect observed lead-time variability, set L method to calculate so backend uses observed lead times. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so demand forecast uses all samples ((1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std) giving conservative replenishment given elevated L and current pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Observed lead_time average \u22482.5 (P1=3, P2=2); P3 outstanding \u2192 lead time elevated/unstable until further concludes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-40.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7: on-hand=174, in-transit=195; recent concludes show variable/extended lead times (P1=3, P2=2, P3=3). There is sustained risk of extended lead time/loss; to capture this, set L using recent observed lead times (last 3) so the OR backend plans for longer pipeline. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so demand forecast uses full-sample mean/variance scaled by (1+L) determined above. This balances higher safety-stock due to longer/variable lead times while keeping demand forecast stable given limited demand shift evidence.

Carry-over insight: Lead time elevated and variable: observed lead_times = [3 (P1), 2 (P2), 3 (P3)] \u2192 recent average \u22482.67; treat lead time as extended/unstable until further concludes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_8. History shows variable/extended lead times with observed lead_times = [3 (P1),2 (P2),3 (P3),2 (P5)] \u2192 avg \u22482.5. Current inventory: on-hand=202, in-transit=118 (pipeline=320). Demand history samples = [112,97,116,138,94] (mean=111.4). Given sustained elevated/unstable lead times, I use calculated average lead time to inform the OR engine so pipeline coverage (1+L) is accurate. mu_hat and sigma_hat set to default to let backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample set, keeping forecasting conservative given limited data. This balances service level (accounting for longer/variable lead time) versus holding cost by increasing target pipeline implicitly through L while relying on historical demand mean/variance rather than overfitting recent fluctuations.

Carry-over insight: Lead time remains elevated but stabilizing: observed lead_times = [3,2,3,2], average \u22482.5 (evidence: Period_4,6,7 concludes). Treat lead time as extended/unstable until further arrives.

Daily Reward (R_t): $40.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_9: on-hand=144, in-transit=173. Historical concludes show variable extended lead times (observed lead_times = [3,2,3,2,2]) with some delayed shipments and occasional 3-period arrivals. To account for this unstable, elevated lead time I choose to let the backend compute L from observed concludes (calculate). For demand parameters I use defaults so mu_hat and sigma_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples) respectively; this leverages full sample history [112,97,116,138,94] while the calculated L will inflate the review+lead period to protect service level given delayed arrivals. This balances higher service level (profit vs stockouts) against holding cost given current ample on-hand and in-transit.

Carry-over insight: Lead time remains elevated/variable: observed lead_times from concludes = [3,2,3,2,2], recent average \u22482.4; treat lead time as extended/unstable until further concludes.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:

Historical concluded lead_times = [3,2,3,2,2] (avg=2.4) with multiple delayed/variable arrivals and one outstanding in-transit batch\u2014evidence of elevated, unstable lead time vs promised=2. I set L to 'calculate' so the OR backend uses the observed average lead time (captures prolonged/variable shipments). Demand history mean ~111.4 with no strong recent demand shift; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing a balanced base-stock that accounts for the longer effective lead time while avoiding overreacting to recent variability.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period_11: on-hand=108, in-transit=198. Historical concluded lead_times (most recent): [3,2,3,2,2,3,2] (avg\u22482.43). Several past orders were delayed or had variable lead times; pipeline contains outstanding units but arrival timing remains uncertain. I choose L methodology that emphasizes recent observed lead-times to reflect the elevated/variable lead-time regime (recent_N, N=5 -> recent avg \u22482.4). Use default demand/statistics so the OR engine computes mu_hat and sigma_hat from full sample (conservative smoothing given limited demand history). This balances service (higher base-stock from elevated L) versus holding cost while acknowledging delivery uncertainty.

Choose L via recent_N (N=5) to capture the recent elevated lead-time regime. Use mu_hat default and sigma_hat default so the backend computes demand over the review+lead period consistently with the chosen L; this raises the base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of demand and reduces stockout risk given delayed arrivals while respecting the OR engine's capped ordering policy.

Historical concluded lead times = [3,2,3,2,2,3,2,3] (avg=2.5) showing persistently elevated/variable lead time versus promised 2 and intermittent lost/delayed shipments. I set L via calculate to let backend use observed lead-time history (captures elevated/variable L). I use default for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, increasing target pipeline to cover the longer effective replenishment period and thus mitigate stockouts from delayed shipments.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_14: on-hand=0, in-transit=387. Historical concluded lead_times = [3,2,3,2,2,3,2,3] (most recent concludes imply elevated/variable lead time). Several early orders were delayed but arrivals since Period_4 confirm shipments are arriving with mean lead_time > promised 2. I set L using recent_N to reflect the recent elevated average (stabilizing ~2.4). Demand history (samples=[112,97,116,138,94]) is limited; I use recent_N on demand with N=5 (all samples) so mu_hat reflects the full sample mean scaled by (1+L). Volatility will use default (all-sample std scaled by sqrt(1+L)). These choices tell the OR backend to target a larger base-stock to cover the extended/variable lead time while keeping sigma from recent-sample noise.

Carry-over insight: Lead time remains elevated/variable: recent observed lead_times (from concludes) = [3,2,3,2,2,3,2,3], recent average \u22482.4; treat lead time as extended/unstable until further confirms. In-transit is large (387) with on-hand=0 \u2014 pipeline partially covers demand but overdue/lost shipments occurred historically.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15: on-hand=0, in-transit=281. Historical concluded lead_times show variable but elevated values (observed sequence length 8, average \u22482.4). Several shipments were delayed historically but pipeline still sizable. Set L via recent_N to reflect recent observed lead-time regime (use last 8 concludes). Use default demand forecasting across all samples for mu_hat and default volatility for sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std based on full history; this balances service (higher L increases cover) versus holding cost given large in-transit inventory and elevated lead-time risk.

LLM Rationale:
Period_16: on-hand=0, in-transit=390. Historical concluded lead_times = [3,2,3,2,2,3,2,3] (avg \u22482.4) showing sustained elevated/variable lead times and some lost/delayed shipments. Use L='calculate' to let backend average observed lead times (captures observed extension). For demand, use default ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) since no clear recent demand regime shift beyond historical samples [112,97,116,138,94]. Volatility set to default as well. This conservative choice increases pipeline cover given extended lead times while relying on full-sample demand stats to balance service level vs holding cost.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17: on-hand=0, in-transit=392. Historical concludes show variable/elevated lead times with observed values \u2248[3,2,3,2,2,3,2,3] (recent average \u22482.4\u20132.5) and several late/outstanding shipments\u2014pipeline is large but arrival timing is uncertain. I set L using recent_N (N=8) to reflect the most recent observed lead-time regime rather than the promised 2, so the OR engine sizes orders for the longer, variable lead time. Demand looks stable (historical samples [112,97,116,138,94]) so I leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as default ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the backend computes demand across review+lead using all data; this balances service level (by increasing base stock for longer lead time) against holding cost given large pipeline.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_18: on-hand=0, in-transit=283. Historical concluded lead_times = [3,2,3,2,2,3,2,3] \u2192 recent average \u22482.4, indicating lead time is elevated and variable vs. promised 2. Demand samples = [112,97,116,138,94], recent behavior shows no clear regime shift in demand magnitude. To hedge delayed arrivals I set L using recent observed lead times (recent_N N=8) so backend uses an elevated lead-time estimate. For demand level I use recent_N over the 5 demand samples (N=5) to reflect current sample mean \xd7 (1+L). I keep sigma_hat as default (all-sample std scaled by sqrt(1+L)) so variability is captured without overfitting. These choices increase the base-stock target to protect service given delayed arrivals while letting the OR engine cap orders via its cap formula to limit over-ordering and holding cost.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 snapshot: on-hand=0, in-transit=389. Historical demand samples = [112,97,116,138,94], mean=111.4. Multiple concluded messages show variable/extended lead times (observed lead_times \u2248 [3,2,3,2,2,3,2,3,2], avg \u22482.4). Pipeline (389) currently provides coverage but past prolonged/no-arrival events indicate elevated risk of delayed or lost shipments. Decision: infer elevated/variable lead time from observed concludes using an averaged historical lead-time estimate (method='calculate') so backend accounts for longer pipeline; use default demand aggregation ((1+L)\xd7mean) and default volatility (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so OR engine applies the longer effective review+lead horizon consistently and leverages historical demand sample base rather than short recent noise. This balances service (higher base stock due to longer L) against holding cost given profit=2 and holding=1.

Carry-over insight: Lead time elevated and variable; observed concluded lead_times \u22482.4 (samples from multiple periods); in-transit large (389) with on-hand=0 \u2192 pipeline partially covers demand but delayed/lost shipments occurred historically. Treat lead time as extended/unstable until further arrival concludes.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_20: on-hand=0, in-transit=281. Historical concluded lead_times = [3,2,3,2,2,3,2,3,2,2,3,1] (avg\u22482.33) showing elevated/variable lead time and past delayed/lost shipments. I set L by 'calculate' to capture the observed average lead time so the OR engine upsizes pipeline coverage versus promised L=2. Demand shows no recent structural shift (samples: [112,97,116,138,94]); I'll keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as 'default' to use full-sample mean/variance scaled by (1+L). This balances higher service risk from delayed arrivals against holding cost given current large in-transit pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Lead time elevated and variable; observed concluded lead_times = [3,2,3,2,2,3,2,3,2,2,3,1], average \u22482.33. In-transit large (281) while on-hand=0 \u2192 pipeline partially covers demand but delayed shipments occurred historically.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:

Historical concluded lead_times = [3,2,3,2,2,3,2,3,2,2,3,1] \u2192 mean \u22482.33, showing persistently elevated and variable lead times and past delayed/lost shipments. I set L to be inferred from observed concludes to capture the longer/variable arrival behavior. For demand, use default (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) so the OR backend computes mu_hat consistent with the chosen L and historical demand samples [112,97,116,138,94]. Volatility left to backend default (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so it scales with the inferred lead time. These choices raise target pipeline to cover extra in-transit delay risk while avoiding ad hoc explicit forecasts.

Carry-over insight: Lead time elevated and variable: observed concluded lead_times = [3,2,3,2,2,3,2,3,2,2,3,1], mean \u22482.33; in-transit large (384) with on-hand=0 \u2192 pipeline partially covers demand but delayed shipments occurred historically.

Pipeline is large but previous shipments experienced delays/losses; be conservative on lead-time estimate. Set L to 'calculate' so backend uses observed average lead time from concluded history. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std are computed consistently with chosen L and backend caps.

To guard against extended/unstable lead time I set L via recent_N to bias the OR engine toward a longer lead-time estimate using recent concluded samples. Demand history (samples [112,97,116,138,94]) shows no clear recent demand regime shift, so use default demand aggregation across samples for mu_hat and default volatility for sigma_hat. This balances service (higher L increases mu_hat) versus holding cost given large in-transit pipeline but persistent delays/losses.

I choose L='calculate' so the backend uses the empirical average of observed lead times (captures the elevated/variable regime). For demand parameters I select 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend uses all past samples ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) \u2014 conservative, stable estimates given limited demand history and high pipeline uncertainty. This balances service level (given long/variable lead times) against holding cost by letting the OR engine compute an evidence-based base stock with observed lead-time input.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:

Period_25: on-hand=0, in-transit=384; historical concluded lead_times show elevated/variable delays (recent mean \u22482.3). Pipeline is large but arrivals have been delayed; to avoid under-ordering vs. extended lead time, use a recent-average lead time estimate. Keep demand and volatility estimation default (use all samples) so the OR engine applies long-run demand stats while L reflects current delay risk.

Carry-over insight: Lead time elevated and variable; recent observed lead_times average \u22482.33 across concludes. In-transit large (384) while on-hand=0 \u2192 pipeline partially covers demand but prior shipments were delayed/lost. Treat lead time as extended/unstable until further arrival concludes.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_26: on-hand=0, in-transit=384. Historical concluded lead_times are variable and elevated (recent average \u22482.33), indicating lead time > promised and unstable shipments. To capture this, set L using 'calculate' (avg of observed lead times). Demand history is limited; use default demand aggregation so mu_hat and sigma_hat scale with (1+L) and full-sample mean/std. This raises target base_stock to cover the longer review+lead period and increases safety stock to mitigate delayed/lost arrivals while letting OR engine cap ordering to control holding cost.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period=27. On-hand=0, in-transit=384; historical concludes show variable/elevated lead times (recent average \u22482.33) and past delayed/lost shipments. To account for extended/unstable lead time I set L explicitly to 2.33 (backlog risk). For demand I use the default estimator so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) (captures baseline demand from provided samples while scaling for extended lead time). For sigma_hat I use default to scale historical volatility by sqrt(1+L). These choices increase pipeline coverage to reduce stockouts given large in-transit but uncertain arrivals while letting the OR backend cap orders to control holding cost.

Use lead-time estimate from observed concludes to capture extended/variable L. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat to defaults so backend scales demand and volatility by (1+L) using full sample history; this raises base-stock to cover extra in-transit delay while keeping standard volatility estimate for service/holding tradeoff.

Demand signal is limited to seed samples; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, letting OR engine adjust orders given the inferred L.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_30: on-hand=0, in-transit=384. Historical concludes show variable, elevated actual lead times (many concludes with W in {1,2,3}, recent average \u22482.33) and evidence of delayed/lost shipments; pipeline exists but arrivals are uncertain. To account for observed extended/variable lead time, set L by averaging observed lead times (calculate). Demand data set is limited; use default demand scaling so backend uses all samples for (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This balances higher safety from longer lead time while letting the OR engine compute service-level stock given profit/holding tradeoff.

Carry-over insight: Lead time elevated & variable: recent observed concluded lead_times average \u22482.33 (multiple concludes with 1\u20133 periods); in-transit large (384) while on-hand=0 \u2192 pipeline partially covers demand but prior shipments were delayed or lost.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
On-hand=0, in-transit=384; historical concludes show variable/elevated lead times (observed concluded lead_times average \u22482.33 across multiple periods) and several delayed/lost shipments. To reflect observed lead-time regime I set L to be data-driven (average of observed lead times). Demand sample set is small and stable in available historical data, so use default demand aggregation for mu_hat and default volatility for sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances raising pipeline coverage for extended lead times while letting the backend cap orders to avoid excessive holding cost given large in-transit stock.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_32: on-hand=0, in-transit=384. Historical concluded lead_times show sustained elevated/variable lead time (~2.33 average) and multiple delayed/lost shipments. Demand recent regime has increased (last 5 demands = 113,109,110,111,154 \u2192 mean \u2248119.4). To reflect persistent extended lead time use calculated average of observed lead times (backend). For demand forecast use the most recent regime (recent_N, N=5) so mu_hat and sigma_hat capture the recent higher mean and volatility, improving service while avoiding excess holding given high holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Lead time elevated and variable; recent observed concluded lead_times average \u22482.33 (multiple concludes). In-transit large (384) while on-hand=0 \u2014 pipeline partially covers demand but prior shipments were delayed or lost. Treat lead time as extended/unstable until new arrival concludes.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Current period=36. On-hand=0, in-transit=384. Historical concluded lead_times show elevated/variable lead time \u22482.3 (multiple concludes across periods) and several delayed/lost shipments; pipeline is large but uncertainty remains. I set L via recent_N to capture the recent elevated lead-time regime. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to base (1+L)\xd7mean on recent demand samples provided in the historical demand seed. I keep sigma_hat as default so backend scales volatility with chosen L. These choices raise target base-stock to protect service level against extended/variable lead time while relying on observed recent demand to avoid overstocking.

Carry-over insight: Lead time elevated and variable: recent observed concluded lead_times average \u22482.33 across multiple concludes; in-transit large (\u2248384) while on-hand=0 \u2014 pipeline partially covers demand but prior shipments were delayed or lost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
On-hand=0, in-transit=385, historic concluded lead_times show elevated/variable delays (recent average \u22482.3). Use a recent-N estimate for L to reflect extended/unstable lead time risk so pipeline calculations account for longer arrivals. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat to default (use full-sample mean/std scaled by (1+L)) to keep demand forecast anchored to historical samples while the lead-time estimate absorbs delivery risk. This balances service (higher L increases safety stock) against holding cost given large in-transit quantity.

Several past shipments were delayed/lost, so trust observed lead-time history rather than promised. Set L via 'calculate' to use the average of observed lead times; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples), which balances service level vs holding cost given elevated/unstable lead times and current large pipeline.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_40: on-hand=0, in-transit=384. Historical conclude messages show variable/elevated actual lead times (multiple concluded lead_times averaging \u22482.33) and several delayed/lost shipments; pipeline is large but arrival timing is unstable. I therefore set L using observed lead-time data (let backend average observed concludes) to capture the elevated/variable lead time. Demand estimates use defaults ((1+L)\xd7mean of provided samples) because the canonical historical demand sample set is small and recent concludes show supply timing\u2014not demand\u2014instability; volatility also left to default. This balances service (by acknowledging longer/variable lead time) against holding cost given already-large in-transit pipeline.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 41: on-hand=0, in-transit=384. Historical concluded lead_times show persistent elevation and variability (recent concludes average \u22482.33). To account for the elevated/variable lead time I use a recent_N estimate for L based on the last 8 observed lead_time concludes (captures recent variability while smoothing single-period noise). For demand I use default forecasting (backend: (1+L)\xd7mean of samples) and default volatility (backend: sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR engine applies the adjusted L when computing base stock; this balances higher safety stock needed for extended/variable lead time against holding cost given large existing pipeline.

Historical concluded lead_times show persistent elevation/variability (recent average \u22482.33) and multiple delayed/lost shipments; pipeline partially covers demand but arrivals have been irregular. To reflect observed instability in lead time while letting the OR engine recompute demand sizing, I set L using the observed average (calculate). I leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the backend uses (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples) respectively\u2014this balances service level (captures extended lead time) against holding costs given large in-transit stock.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 43: on-hand=0, in-transit=387. Historical conclude messages show multiple observed lead_times (mix of 1\u20133) with recent average \u22482.33 and persistent delayed/partial arrivals. Because concluded lead-time history is the reliable signal, set L method to 'calculate' (use average of observed lead times). Demand sample set is small (provided historical demands = [112,97,116,138,94]); use default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR backend computes demand over the review+lead period consistent with the inferred L. This balances higher service level (by increasing base-stock via larger (1+L) factor) against holding cost given large outstanding pipeline and prior lost/delayed shipments.

Carry-over insight: Lead time elevated and variable; concluded lead_times average \u22482.33 (multiple concludes). In-transit large (387) while on-hand=0 \u2192 pipeline partially covers demand but prior shipments were delayed or lost. Treat lead time as extended/unstable until new arrival concludes.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_44: on-hand=0, in-transit=387. Historical concluded lead_times are elevated and variable (recent average \u22482.33), with repeated delayed or partial arrivals; pipeline exists but on-hand is zero so stockout risk remains. I set L to be inferred from observed concludes so the OR engine accounts for the extended/unstable lead time. For demand, use default (all-sample mean scaled by 1+L) and default volatility so the backend's base-stock calculation uses the full sample statistics while incorporating the inferred lead time. This balances service level (longer L \u2192 larger mu_hat safety) versus holding cost given large in-transit volume.

Carry-over insight: Lead time elevated & variable: recent observed concluded lead_times average \u22482.33 (multiple concludes); in-transit large (387) while on-hand=0 \u2014 pipeline partially covers demand but prior shipments were delayed or partially lost. Treat lead time as extended/unstable until new arrival concludes.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_45: on-hand=0, in-transit=384. Historical concluded lead_times show elevated/variable lead time with recent mean \u22482.33 (multiple concludes across periods). To account for extended/unstable lead time use recent_N for L using the last 12 observed lead_times. Demand history small (5 samples); keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using chosen L. This increases pipeline-cover target to mitigate delayed/lost shipments while letting OR backend trade service vs holding cost.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Context: Period_46. On-hand=0, in-transit=392. Historical concluded lead_times repeatedly show extended/variable delivery (recent average \u22482.33). To hedge service level given volatile/extended lead times, set lead-time estimate using recent observed concludes (captures extension), and keep demand forecasts using full-sample defaults ((1+L)\xd7mean) so the OR engine uses stable demand stats while accounting for longer pipeline. Sigma left as default to reflect historical volatility.

Period_47: on-hand=0, in-transit=401. Historical concludes show elevated/variable lead times (multiple concluded lead_times averaging \u22482.3) and past delayed/lost shipments; pipeline partially covers demand but risk of further delays remains. I set L='calculate' so backend uses observed concluded lead times average (captures elevated/variable lead-time empirically). For demand I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, relying on the engine's base-stock formula while the increased L raises protection for delayed arrivals. This balances service level (protecting against extended lead time) vs holding cost given large in-transit pipeline.

LLM Rationale:
Period 49 decision. On-hand=0, in-transit=393; historical concluded lead_times show persistent elevation/variability (~2.3 periods). Pipeline quantity is substantial but prior concludes show delayed arrivals/loss risk. Choose L='calculate' to let backend use observed concluded lead times (captures elevated/variable LT). Use mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' so demand review+lead estimates follow all available demand samples (conservative pooling given limited sample set). This balances service (accounting for longer effective LT) against holding cost by increasing lead-time coverage while using standard demand stats.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_50: on-hand=0, in-transit=393. Historical concluded lead_times consistently above promised 2; recent concluded average \u22482.33. Demand baseline (historical samples) mean \u2248111.4. To reflect elevated/variable lead time and avoid underordering, set L explicitly to observed recent average (2.33). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full samples, giving a conservative replenishment that balances service vs holding cost given elevated lead-time risk.

Carry-over insight: Lead time remains elevated/variable; recent observed concluded lead_times average \u22482.33. In-transit large (393) while on-hand=0 \u2014 pipeline partially covers demand but prior shipments were delayed or partially lost. Treat lead time as extended/unstable until new arrival concludes.
