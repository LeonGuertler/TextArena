Demand analysis: recent five-period demand (P45\u2013P49) = [103,105,122,106,117], mean \u2248110.6; long-run patterns centered ~110\u2013120. Profit/holding ratio implies OR's base-stock approach (OR recom=111) is consistent with this demand. Decision: follow OR recommendation of 111 units so on-hand before demand \u2248120, which balances expected sales (~111) against holding cost (1) and high profit (4). This minimizes expected stockouts while keeping excess inventory moderate. Final action: order 111 units (arrives same period).",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Followed OR's 111-unit recommendation \u2014 lead time confirmed 0 so order arrives before demand and recent mean demand \u2248111, balancing stockout risk and holding cost.",
