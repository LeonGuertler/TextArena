OR computed base-stock then applied a cap and recommended 141 units. Lead-time & timing implications: With L=2, an order placed now will only arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution (visible in Period 4). Current on-hand=0 and in-transit=0, so no new units can satisfy Period 1 or Period 2 demand. Inventory planning rule: order + on-hand + in-transit should cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand (current + next L periods). Expected demand over 3 periods = 3 \xd7 111.4 \u2248 334.2 units. Decision tradeoff: OR's capped recommendation (141) is driven by a per-period cap and would leave us understocked for the 3-period horizon, increasing expected lost sales when shipments finally arrive. Holding cost is non-trivial ($1/unit/period) but hitting expected demand coverage reduces lost-profit risk (profit $2/unit). Action chosen: override OR and order 334 units to cover the 3-period expected demand, accepting some holding cost risk once stock arrives but minimizing lost sales and maximizing profit over the horizon.
