Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Starting period with no on-hand or in-transit inventory and no concluded arrivals. No evidence of lead-time deviations or demand regime change in the provided history. Use promised lead time and default demand estimates based on all samples to let the OR engine compute base_stock balancing profit vs holding cost.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_2 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=141 (order placed in Period_1 not yet concluded). No concluded arrivals exist so actual lead time unknown; follow promised lead time. Historical demand samples show mean \u2248111.4 and moderate variance. Use default methods so backend uses promised L and full-sample demand stats ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This keeps pipeline coverage for (L+1) periods and avoids premature regime adjustments given no arrival confirmations.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period: Period_3. On-hand=0, in-transit=278 (orders from Period 1 and 2). No concluded arrivals yet (Period 1 and 2 orders show arrived=0 in their conclude messages), so actual lead time is not confirmed \u2014 could be normal promised lead time=4 or shipments delayed/lost. Demand history samples: [112,97,116,138,94]. Given lack of concluded arrivals and no definitive lead-time observations, use default (promised) lead time so OR backend retains its prior. Use default demand/volatility calculations ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to let backend compute base stock while avoiding overfitting to assumed delays. This balances service level (use pipeline) vs holding cost until we observe concluded arrivals or clear evidence of lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Possible shipment delay: orders placed in Period 1 (141) and Period 2 (137) have not concluded (arrived=0 in their conclude messages) \u2014 monitor for extended lead time or lost shipments.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Observed three consecutive concluded periods with zero arrivals for orders placed in Periods 1\u20133, suggesting shipment delays or potential lost shipments. On-hand=0 and in-transit=417 implies outstanding pipeline but no confirmed arrivals yet. Evidence is insufficient to reliably compute a shorter/longer realized lead time (no positive arrival concludes), so I retain the promised lead time and use default demand/volatility calculations based on all historical samples to let the OR engine compute base-stock and caps using its statistical priors. This balances service level (use full sample mean across (1+L) periods) against holding cost while awaiting conclusive arrival data.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_5 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=555. No concluded arrivals have been observed yet (Period1-4 conclude all arrived=0) but given promised lead time=4, orders placed in Period1 would only conclude in Period5 conclude (read in Period6). Insufficient evidence of extended lead time or lost shipments yet. Demand history samples = [112,97,116,138,94], so use default lead time and default demand moments to let OR engine apply its statistical forecast. Pipeline (555) already provides substantial cover versus (1+L) periods; using defaults balances service vs holding cost conservatively until actual late arrivals are observed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $12.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period: Period_6. Recent concluded message (Period_5) shows arrival=141 units ordered on Period_1 with lead_time=4, which matches the promised lead time. On-hand=90, in-transit=423; several recent orders remain in-transit and some will arrive during Period_6 (not yet visible). Historical demand samples = [112,97,116,138,94], mean=111.4. No strong evidence of demand regime change or increased volatility. I therefore retain the promised lead time and use default demand/volatility calculations so the OR backend computes base stock using the full-sample mean and std over a 1+L review+lead horizon, balancing service level (profit vs. holding cost) without overreacting to transient in-transit noise.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time confirmed = 4 periods (evidence: Period_5 conclude: arrived=141 units ordered on Period_1, lead_time was 4 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-26.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7: confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods from Period_5 conclude (Period_1 order arrived in Period_5, lead_time=4). On-hand=160, in-transit=315. Demand history stable (samples [112,97,116,138,94], mean=111.4). Use promised/default lead time and default demand estimates so OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility using all samples; this balances service (confirmed L=4) against holding cost given moderate on-hand + sizable pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time confirmed = 4 periods (evidence: Period_5 conclude: arrived=141 units ordered on Period_1, lead_time was 4 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $10.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 4 (Period5: P1\u2192arrived lead_time=4; Period6: P2\u21924; Period7: P3\u21924). On-hand=196, in-transit=227 provides healthy pipeline. I set L via calculate to reflect observed lead times (avg=4). Demand parameters use defaults so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples), letting the OR backend compute base-stock and cap from the full-sample stats and the confirmed lead time. This balances service (use observed L) with holding cost by not overreacting to short-term variation.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Context: Period 9. On-hand=242, in-transit=192. Historical demand samples (given) mean \u2248 112.4; past conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (orders from Periods 1\u20134 arrived with W=4). Reconciliation: pipeline (in-transit + on-hand = 434) comfortably covers (1+L) periods of expected demand at L=4. Decision: use L default (promised lead time = 4, matches confirmed observations), mu_hat default ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and sigma_hat default (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples). This keeps the OR backend anchored to observed demand and confirmed lead time, balancing service level (reduce stockouts with base-stock sized for L+1 periods) against holding cost by not inflating forecasts or volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $49.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
No new calendar/news. Historical concludes show consistent actual lead time = 4 (arrivals from Periods 5\u20139 correspond to orders placed 4 periods earlier). On-hand=151, in-transit=271. Demand samples [112,97,116,138,94] show stable mean; I will use the promised/confirmed lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend applies its standard base-stock calculation ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This balances service (use confirmed L=4) with holding cost by not inflating demand or volatility unnecessarily.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained lead-time regime: actual lead time = 4 periods (evidence: Period_5\u2013Period_9 conclude messages show arrivals for orders placed 4 periods earlier).

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:

Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (arrivals in Periods 5\u201310 correspond to orders placed 4 periods earlier), and prior suspected delays have resolved. Demand historical samples: [112,97,116,138,94] (mean=111.4). Decision: use promised/default lead time to match confirmed regime and keep OR engine assumptions aligned. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat to default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this provides a stable forecast (m\xfb=5\xd7mean) and volatility consistent with observed variability, while current on-hand + large in-transit position (342 total units visible) already offers coverage for upcoming periods and reduces risk of stockouts without excessive extra ordering.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Actual lead time has been consistently 4 periods (Period_5\u2013Period_13 conclude messages). Current on-hand=0, in-transit=425 (coverage for forthcoming arrivals). Use the confirmed lead-time regime and historical demand samples [112,97,116,138,94] to let the OR engine compute base-stock balancing profit ($2) vs holding ($1). I choose default methods so the backend uses promised/confirmed L and full-sample demand mean/variance to produce a stable order quantity that covers (L+1) periods while limiting holding cost exposure.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 15 update: on-hand=0, in-transit=428. Concluded history (Periods 5\u201314) consistently shows arrivals for orders placed 4 periods earlier \u2192 actual lead time = 4. Demand samples mean=111.4, std from samples used by backend. I set L=default to use the promised lead time (4) which matches observed regime. I select mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. Note: pipeline (428) is below target coverage (\u22485\xd7mean\u2248557), so the backend will likely order to rebuild stock to the computed base stock while respecting caps.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_16: on-hand=0, in-transit=462. Historical concluded lead times consistently =4 periods (arrivals in Period_5\u2013Period_15 map to orders 4 periods earlier). Demand history samples: [112,97,116,138,94], mean=111.4. I choose L=default to use promised lead time (4) because concluded history confirms a stable 4-period lead time. I choose mu_hat=default so backend computes (1+L)*mean(all samples)=5*111.4 to cover review+lead demand. I choose sigma_hat=default so backend uses sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples) to size safety stock. These settings balance service level against holding cost given confirmed L=4 and recent average demand; large in-transit inventory will be reconciled by the OR cap.

Carry-over insight: Sustained actual lead-time regime confirmed = 4 periods (evidence: Period_5\u2013Period_15 conclude messages show arrivals for orders placed 4 periods earlier).

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent conclude messages (Periods 5\u201316) consistently show arrivals for orders placed 4 periods earlier \u2014 actual lead time = 4. On-hand=51, in-transit=406 (healthy pipeline). I set L to be calculated from observed lead times (calculate) to reflect confirmed L=4. Demand sample mean from provided history is 111.4; I use the backend default mu_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean) so the engine targets a base stock covering the review+lead horizon. I leave sigma_hat as default so the backend scales observed demand variability by \u221a(1+L). These choices align the OR engine with the confirmed 4-period lead time and rely on historical demand summary to balance service level vs holding cost given current ample pipeline.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_18: sustained actual lead time = 4 periods (confirmed repeatedly Period_5\u2013Period_17 conclude messages). Recent on-hand = 66, in-transit = 355 \u2014 pipeline + on-hand comfortably cover several periods of demand. No clear demand regime shift in recent sales (historical samples remain representative). I therefore use the default lead time (promised = 4) and default demand/volatility computations so the OR backend uses all historical samples to compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This keeps the base-stock tied to established demand statistics and leverages the large in-transit volume to avoid excessive new ordering while maintaining service level given profit vs holding tradeoff.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 19. History shows a sustained actual lead time = 4 periods (Period_5\u2013Period_18 conclude messages consistently show arrivals for orders placed 4 periods earlier). Demand history samples = [112,97,116,138,94], mean ~111.4. On-hand=92, in-transit=364 (pipeline covers multiple future periods). I keep L as default (promised 4) because concluded messages confirm the 4-period regime. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this leverages all historical demand while matching the confirmed lead time, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_20: on-hand=76, in-transit=328. Historical conclude messages confirm a sustained actual lead time = 4 periods (consistent arrivals for orders placed 4 periods earlier through Period_19). On-hand+in-transit = 404 units vs. rough (1+L)\xd7mean demand \u2248 5\xd7111.4=557, so pipeline+on-hand currently short of target cover for (L+1) periods. Given stable lead-time regime and no recent demand changepoint, use default (promised) lead time and default demand statistics so the OR backend computes base-stock from full-sample mean/SD and generates replenishment to restore the pipeline while balancing profit vs holding cost.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_21: sustained actual lead time = 4 periods (confirmed repeatedly Period_5\u2013Period_20 conclude messages). On-hand=51, in-transit=380 \u2014 pipeline is large relative to recent demand. No new demand/seasonality signal; historical sample set (past demands) will be used. Choose promised lead time (default) since observed lead time matches promise. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this keeps the base-stock anchored to long-run demand while the large in-transit reduces need for aggressive ordering, balancing service level vs holding cost.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Sustained actual lead time = 4 periods is well-supported by conclude history (Period_5\u2013Period_21 arrivals match orders placed 4 periods earlier). Current on-hand 29 + in-transit 405 gives ample pipeline but arrivals are observed with a 1-period visibility delay. Use promised/default lead time and demand statistics (no recent changepoint in the provided demand samples) so the OR backend's base-stock formula matches historical mean/variance while avoiding over-adjustment for noise.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period_26. Demand history shows stable samples; actual lead time has been consistently 4 periods in conclude messages through Period_25. Current on-hand=39, in-transit=401 (pipeline ample). Given confirmed LT=4 and no recent demand regime shift, use promised/default lead time and default demand statistics so OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from historical samples. This balances service level (maintain coverage over L+1 periods) while avoiding excess holding cost since pipeline is large.

Carry-over insight: Sustained actual lead-time regime = 4 periods confirmed through Period_25 (evidence: Period_5\u2013Period_25 conclude messages show arrivals for orders placed 4 periods earlier).

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_27: sustained actual lead time = 4 periods (consistent arrivals in Period_5\u2013Period_26 conclude messages). On-hand=42, in-transit=393 provides strong pipeline coverage. Historical demand samples (5) show mean \u2248111.4 units/period; no recent changepoint detected. Use promised/default lead time and default demand moments so OR backend uses full-sample mean/variance scaled by (1+L), keeping service while avoiding unnecessary extra safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Sustained actual lead-time regime = 4 periods confirmed through Period_26 (evidence: Period_5\u2013Period_26 conclude messages show arrivals for orders placed 4 periods earlier).

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_28: sustained actual lead time = 4 periods (confirmed through Period_26 conclude messages). Current inventory: on-hand=8, in-transit=403 \u2014 pipeline is large relative to on-hand so no emergency order sizing change needed. Demand context: baseline samples (provided) show moderate demand; no calendar news or regime shifts detected. Choose L=default to use promised lead time (promised=4, matches observed). Use mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this leverages full historical data and the confirmed stable lead-time regime to balance service level vs holding cost given large in-transit stock.

Historical demand samples (used by environment) = [112,97,116,138,94] show no recent regime shift. Use default L (promised lead time = 4) to align with confirmed arrivals.

LLM Rationale:
Actual lead time has been consistently 4 periods (confirmed through Period_29 conclude messages). On-hand=17, in-transit=400; no evidence of new delays or lost shipments. Use promised/default lead time so OR backend keeps L=4. Demand history (samples [112,97,116,138,94]) shows no recent structural shift warranting a recent_N or EWMA adjustment; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample set.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_31 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=425. Historical concluded messages show a sustained actual lead time of 4 periods (arrivals consistently correspond to orders placed 4 periods earlier). Demand context: SKU is chips(Regular) with historical sample set provided; no calendar/news spike indicated. Pipeline (425) plus expected arrivals should cover several periods of demand. I therefore use default lead time (promised 4) because concluded history confirms L=4, and use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the provided demand samples\u2014this balances service level (using confirmed L and full-sample stats) versus holding cost given current large pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Sustained actual lead-time regime = 4 periods confirmed through Period_30 (evidence: Period_5\u2013Period_30 conclude messages show arrivals for orders placed 4 periods earlier).

On-hand=0, in-transit=440. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods through Period_31 (arrivals for orders placed 4 periods earlier). Use calculate for L to lock in observed lead-time regime=4. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full demand history, which leverages all data to set base stock consistent with observed demand variability while the OR cap limits large single-period orders\u2014balancing service level (profit>holding) against holding cost.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 33. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods through Period_32; no evidence of lost shipments. On-hand=25, in-transit=423 -> healthy pipeline. Demand history (samples) mean ~111.4 supports using the standard default forecasting. I therefore keep L as promised (default = 4), and use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level (profit > holding cost) against inventory holding given a confirmed 4-period lead time and sizable in-transit stock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $126.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 34. Historical conclude messages consistently confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (sustained through Period_33). Recent on-hand=48, in-transit=401 \u2014 pipeline is large relative to one-period demand but arrivals occur with 4-period lag. Demand history available: [112,97,116,138,94] (mean ~111.4). Profit $2 / unit vs holding $1 / unit/period implies moderate service-level target. I choose L=default to use the promised lead time (4) because concluded history matches promised lead time. I choose mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this leverages full historical demand given no clear recent demand regime shift. These settings keep orders sized to cover the (L+1)-period demand while letting the backend cap orders to limit overshoot given sizable in-transit inventory.

Actual lead time has been consistently 4 periods (confirmed through Period_34 conclude messages). On-hand=79, in-transit=375 \u2192 pipeline + on-hand (454) comfortably covers 5-period demand at recent mean. Use promised/default lead time so OR backend aligns with observed steady regime. Use default demand/volatility estimators (all-sample mean/std scaled by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L)) because no recent structural demand shift or calendar event is evident and historical samples are limited.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 37. On-hand=38, in-transit=366. Historical conclude messages (Periods 5\u201336) consistently show arrivals for orders placed 4 periods earlier \u2192 sustained actual lead time = 4. Demand sample set is small and shows no clear regime shift, so use defaults: trust promised lead time and use all available demand samples for (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility. This keeps the OR backend anchored to observed steady LT and avoids overreacting to short-term fluctuations; pipeline + on-hand already covers multiple periods of demand but defaults ensure base-stock accounts for (1+L) demand uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Sustained actual lead-time regime = 4 periods confirmed through Period_36 (evidence: Period_5\u2013Period_36 conclude messages show arrivals for orders placed 4 periods earlier).

Current inventory: on-hand=29, in-transit=410 \u2014 pipeline is large and consistent with steady 4-period arrivals. To align the OR engine (which trusts promised lead time=4) with observed regime and avoid overreacting to pipeline, use default lead time and default demand/statistics so backend computes base stock from full-sample mean/variance over (1+L) periods. This balances service (high profit relative to holding cost) while not inflating forecasts based on short-term noise.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40: historical concluded messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (sustained through Period_39). Recent demand samples (given) have mean ~111.4; use default calculations so OR backend applies (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std. Current stock: on-hand=33, in-transit=420 \u2014 pipeline ample to cover multiple periods at observed demand, so stick with promised/default settings to let backend balance service level vs holding cost.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Context: Period 41. Historical demand samples (seed): [112,97,116,138,94] \u2192 mean \u2248111.4. Actual lead time has been reliably 4 periods across many conclude messages (Periods 5\u201340). Current inventory: on-hand=33, in-transit=380, which covers roughly 5 periods of average demand (5\xd7111.4\u2248557 needed vs. 413 on-hand+in-transit visible to OR? but pipeline is large). Decision: use promised/default lead time to match sustained observed regime and let OR compute base-stock from full-sample mean/variance. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples \u2014 conservative, stable inputs given no recent demand regime shift. This balances service (large pipeline + base stock) against holding cost by letting the OR engine set safety stock per profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 42. History shows sustained actual lead time = 4 periods (Period_5\u2013Period_41 concludes). Recent on-hand=46, in-transit=366 \u2014 pipeline large relative to demand history (past demands: [112,97,116,138,94]). Given confirmed 4-period lead time and ample pipeline, use default lead time (promised=4) so OR backend uses stable L. Use default mu_hat and default sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this leverages full historical demand to set base-stock while the large in-transit reduces the need for aggressive increases. This balances service level (use observed L) against holding cost given current high pipeline.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_43: sustained actual lead time = 4 periods per concluded history (Period_5\u2192Period_42 arrivals all show lead_time=4). Current on-hand=28, in-transit=391 (pipeline total=419). Historical sample mean demand=111.4 \u2192 (L+1)=5 periods demand \u2248557, so current pipeline is below coverage for 5 periods; keep backend L at promised/observed 4 and use default demand aggregation so OR engine computes base-stock using full-sample mean/variance. Defaults balance service level (uses all data) while reflecting confirmed LT=4; this avoids overreacting to short-term fluctuations given sustained regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $145.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_44: no special calendar events. Historical concluded messages show sustained actual lead time = 4 periods. Current inventory: on-hand=21, in-transit=430 (large pipeline). Given stable lead-time regime and sizable pipeline, use default estimates so OR backend uses promised L=4 and demand stats from all samples. This keeps service level aligned with observed arrivals while avoiding excess holding cost from aggressive uplifts.

Carry-over insight: Sustained actual lead-time regime = 4 periods confirmed through Period_43 (evidence: Period_5\u2013Period_43 conclude messages show arrivals for orders placed 4 periods earlier).

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 45: on-hand=0, in-transit=435. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (sustained through recent periods). Demand seed samples = [112,97,116,138,94] (mean=111.4). I keep L=promised (default) since actual lead time is stable at 4 and matches promise. Use mu_hat=default to let backend set (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples (captures baseline demand over review+lead window). Use sigma_hat=default so backend computes sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples to reflect observed volatility. This balances service level vs holding cost given large in-transit stock (435) and zero on-hand; default settings rely on OR engine caps to avoid over-ordering while maintaining service for the 4-period lead time.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Context: Period_46. Profit $2, Holding $1. On-hand=15, In-transit=414. Historical conclude messages consistently show arrivals for orders placed 4 periods earlier (Periods 5\u201345 conclude messages). Lead-time regime is sustained at 4 periods. Demand history seed (provided) = [112, 97, 116, 138, 94]. Given strong empirical evidence of L=4, set L by averaging observed lead times to lock actual lead time. Use default demand/volatility formulas ((1+L)\xd7mean, sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR backend computes mu_hat and sigma_hat consistent with L and historical samples. This balances service (use observed L) vs holding cost by relying on data-driven base-stock inputs and the capped order cap.

Carry-over insight: Sustained actual lead-time regime = 4 periods confirmed through Period_45 (evidence: Period_5\u2013Period_45 conclude messages show arrivals for orders placed 4 periods earlier).

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_47. Demand history sample (chips Regular) = [112,97,116,138,94]; recent conclude messages (through Period_46) show a sustained actual lead time = 4 periods. Current on-hand=31, in-transit=396 \u2014 pipeline is large relative to single-period demand. Given clear evidence for a stable 4-period lead time, use the backend defaults so OR uses (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std based on all samples; this balances service level (with confirmed L=4) against holding cost given sizable pipeline.

Demand context: product is chips(Regular) with small-sample historical demands provided; no new calendar/news signals. Given confirmed stable 4-period lead time and no evidence of a recent demand regime change, use the backend defaults so it computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This keeps parameters grounded in full-sample stats while the large in-transit volume reduces urgency to inflate forecasts; defaults balance service level (capture demand over review+lead window) against holding cost.

Promised lead time=4 and actual lead time has been consistently 4 \u2014 stick with promised (default). Using default L and default mu/sigma lets the OR backend compute base-stock from the full-sample mean/variance; this is appropriate given stable demand history.
