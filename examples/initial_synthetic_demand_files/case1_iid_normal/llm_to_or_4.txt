Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. No on-hand or in-transit inventory; no concluded arrivals to infer lead time. Historical demand samples for chips(Regular) = [112,97,116,138,94] (mean ~111.4). Promised lead time = 2 periods; no evidence to deviate. Use default lead time so backend applies promised L=2. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This keeps forecasting anchored to full-sample demand and avoids overreacting to limited data, while the OR engine will cap orders appropriately given profit vs. holding cost.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_2 start. Historical demand samples=[112,97,116,138,94] (mean=111.4). Period_1 order of 141 remains in-transit and arrived=0 in Period_1 conclude, indicating the shipment did not arrive within one period; this could be a delayed shipment but not yet confirmed lost. Promised lead time=2. To be conservative given limited evidence of a persistent lead-time shift, use default (promised) lead time so the OR engine leverages its built-in forecast. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std are applied with L=promised; this balances service level vs holding cost while we await conclude messages to confirm any lead-time change.

Carry-over insight: Period_1 ordered=141 remains in-transit and arrived=0 (overdue relative to 1-period); monitor for conclude messages to confirm delay or loss.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 start. Demand history shows samples [112,97,116,138,94] (mean=111.4). On-hand=0, in-transit=278 (orders from Periods 1\u20132 remain overdue; no concluded arrivals yet). Because two consecutive orders (Period 1 and 2) have not concluded, I assume actual lead time is longer than the promised 2 periods and set L explicitly to 4 to buffer against further delays. I use default demand aggregation for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting the backend produce a conservative base-stock while capping order size via its cap formula. This balances higher safety stock to avoid stockouts given overdue shipments against holding cost sensitivity.

Carry-over insight: Overdue shipments: orders placed in Periods 1 and 2 remain in-transit with arrived=0; evidence suggests an extended lead-time regime\u2014treat lead time as longer than promised until conclude messages show arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=417, recent concludes show ordered units from Periods 1\u20133 all arrived=0 -> shipments overdue. This signals an extended lead-time regime vs promised L=2. I set L explicit=4 to conservatively cover delayed/lost shipments when computing (1+L) demand coverage. Demand history mean=111.4 from samples [112,97,116,138,94]; use default mu_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean with chosen L. Use default sigma_hat so backend computes volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). This increases target base-stock to protect service level while recognizing holding cost tradeoff.

Carry-over insight: Extended lead-time regime detected: orders from Periods 1\u20133 remained in-transit with arrived=0 (evidence of lead-time > promised 2); treat lead time as longer until conclude messages confirm arrivals.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 decision: on-hand=154, in-transit=277. Historical demand samples [112,97,116,138,94] mean=111.4. Conclude messages show arrivals in Period 4: Period1 order arrived with lead_time=3, Period2 order arrived with lead_time=2 \u2192 evidence of an extended lead-time regime (longer than promised 2). To account for this, set L method to calculate so the backend uses the observed average lead time. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, maintaining demand forecasting while letting the backend increase coverage for the longer inferred lead time. This balances higher safety stock to cover delayed arrivals versus holding cost given profit=2 and holding=1.

Carry-over insight: Extended lead-time regime confirmed: orders from Periods 1\u20133 experienced delays; observed lead_times = 3 (Period1) and 2 (Period2) per Period 4 conclude. Treat lead time as longer than promised until conclude messages show consistent returns to promised lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-1.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_6: On-hand=103, in-transit=299. Historical demands = [112,97,116,138,94]. Concluded arrivals show lead_times = 3 (order P1) and 2 (order P2) -> evidence of extended lead-time regime vs promised 2. To hedge against longer delivery while letting OR backend use observed lead-time average, set L by 'calculate' (backend will average observed lead times). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, keeping forecasts anchored to full history while the increased L raises coverage for the longer pipeline. This balances service (avoid stockouts given 299 in-transit and observed delays) and holding cost by not inflating demand forecast beyond historical mean.

Carry-over insight: Extended lead-time regime confirmed: observed lead_times = 3 (Period1 order) and 2 (Period2 order) per Period_4 conclude; treat lead time as longer than promised until conclude messages show consistent returns to promised lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-41.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 7. On-hand=175, in-transit=194. Historical concluded lead_times: Period1\u21923, Period2\u21922, Period3\u21923 (observed in Period4 and Period6 concludes), indicating an extended lead-time regime averaging ~2.67 periods. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the average observed lead time. Demand history samples = [112,97,116,138,94]; no clear recent demand changepoint, so use default aggregation for mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to let OR compute base-stock while accounting for longer lead time and preserving cap behavior. This balances higher pipeline coverage to avoid stockouts from delayed arrivals while letting backend trade off holding cost via its z* formulation.

Carry-over insight: Extended lead-time regime: observed lead_times = 3 (Period1), 2 (Period2), 3 (Period3) per Period4/Period6 concludes; average observed lead_time \u2248 2.67. Treat lead time as longer than promised until conclude messages show consistent returns to promised L.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 8. Recent concludes show actual lead_times = [3 (P1),2 (P2),3 (P3),2 (P5)] \u2192 average \u22482.5, indicating an extended lead-time regime vs promised 2. On-hand=94, in-transit=226. Demand has softened recently; last 5 observed demands (P3\u2013P7) = [119,124,51,67,103], suggesting a lower short-run mean. I set L to recent_N to reflect the empirically observed longer lead time. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to anchor forecasts to the most recent regime and reduce over-ordering given elevated pipeline and higher observed lead time. These choices help the OR backend compute a base-stock that balances service (by recognizing longer lead time) against holding cost (by using recent lower demand estimates).

Carry-over insight: Updated extended lead-time estimate: recent observed lead_times = [3,2,3,2], average \u22482.5; treat lead time > promised until concludes show consistent return to promised L.

Daily Reward (R_t): $148.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period: Period 9. Recent concluded arrivals show an extended lead-time regime: observed lead_times = [3,2,3,2] (avg \u22482.5). On-hand=36, in-transit=247; some large pipeline exists but arrivals have been delayed historically. I set L using recent observed lead times (recent_N=4) to capture the current extended regime rather than the promised 2. For demand forecast I use recent demand samples (N=5) to compute (1+L)\xd7mean of recent demands, keeping the estimate responsive to recent realized demand. Volatility uses default scaling of all samples. These choices bias orders upward vs. promised L to avoid stockouts given delayed arrivals, while sigma_hat/default lets the OR backend size safety stock per historical variability.

Carry-over insight: Extended lead-time regime persists \u2014 recent observed lead_times = [3,2,3,2], average \u22482.5; treat L > promised 2 until concludes show consistent returns to promised lead time.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10. On-hand=0, in-transit=290. Historical concluded lead_times recent = [3,2,3,2] \u2192 average \u22482.5; evidence of an extended lead-time regime persisting beyond promised L=2. I set L explicitly to 2.5 to capture the longer delivery horizon. I leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, letting the engine balance service level (via larger base_stock from increased L) against holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Extended lead-time regime persists: recent observed lead_times = [3,2,3,2], average = 2.5; treat lead time > promised 2 until concludes show consistent return to promised L.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 start: on-hand=30, in-transit=259. Historical concludes show persistent extended lead-times for multiple orders (observed lead_times sequence: [3,2,3,2,2,3,2] from Periods 4\u201310 conclusions) \u2014 recent average \u22482.43 > promised 2. Demand recent history (Periods 4\u201310) shows moderate volume and variability; to cover review+lead demand and reflect the recent regime, I set L to the recent average of observed lead times and use recent demand samples (most recent 7 periods) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility from the latest regime. This balances service level (against overdue shipments) with holding costs given substantial pipeline inventory (259 units) \u2014 using recent_N keeps responsiveness to regime shifts while capping orders via the OR engine's cap.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period=12. On-hand=0, in-transit=292 (large pipeline) and recent concluded arrivals show persistent extended lead-times (observed lead_times sequence \u2248 [3,2,3,2,2,3,2]). I set L using recent_N to reflect the most recent lead-time regime (focus on last 4 observed lead_times to be responsive to recent returns to 2\u20133). Demand has been variable but recent periods (P7\u2013P11) show a stable average around 99 units; I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture the current demand regime over the review+lead period. These choices (longer recent L and recent demand stats) ensure the OR engine targets a base stock that covers (1+L) periods of\u8fd1\u671f demand while reflecting recent volatility, balancing service level against holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

Carry-over insight: Extended lead-time regime persists; recent observed lead_times (most recent 7 concluded) \u2248 [3,2,3,2,2,3,2], mean \u22482.43. Treat L > promised 2 until concludes show consistent return to promised lead time.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13. On-hand 0, in-transit 317. Recent conclues show extended lead-time regime with recent observed lead_times = [3,2,3,2,2,3,2], mean \u22482.43 and demand elevated/variable in recent periods. To account for longer actual lead times and recent demand regime, set L using recent_N over the last 7 observed lead times and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=7 to bias the base-stock toward recent higher mean and capture recent volatility.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_14: on-hand=0, in-transit=379. Historical concludes show an extended lead-time regime (multiple concluded lead_times > promised 2). I set L using recent_N to capture the recent extended lead-time behaviour (avg of last concluded lead_times). mu_hat and sigma_hat use default data-driven calculations so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; increasing L raises required pipeline cover to protect service level while the capped ordering limits control inventory growth.

Carry-over insight: Extended lead-time regime persists; recent observed lead_times (last 7 concluded) \u2248 [3,2,3,2,2,3,2], mean \u22482.43. Treat lead time > promised 2 until concludes show consistent return to promised L.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_15: on-hand=0, in-transit=326. Historical concluded lead_times show persistent extended regime (recent sequence \u2248 [3,2,3,2,2,3,2], mean \u22482.43). To hedge against ongoing delays I set L based on recent lead-time observations. Demand has been variable recently; use a recent_N forecast for mu_hat to reflect the latest demand regime and default volatility for sigma_hat so OR backend scales with chosen L.

Carry-over insight: Extended lead-time regime persists; recent observed lead_times (last 7 concluded) = [3,2,3,2,2,3,2], mean \u22482.43. Treat lead time > promised 2 until concludes show consistent return to promised L.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16: on-hand=0, in-transit=412. Historical concluded lead_times show persistent extension (recent concluded lead_times = [3,2,3,2,2,3,2], mean \u22482.43). Pipeline is large (412) from prior orders; avoid aggressive additional ordering. Set L based on recent lead-time observations to capture extended regime. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample demand history, letting OR engine size orders conservatively against the longer inferred lead time and the existing large pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Extended lead-time regime persists; recent concluded lead_times (last 7) = [3,2,3,2,2,3,2], mean \u22482.43. Treat promised L=2 as understated until concludes show consistent return to 2.

Use recent_N (N=7) for L to reflect observed longer lead time so pipeline-cover calculation accounts for slower arrivals. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full demand history (stable demand sample set [112,97,116,138,94]); this balances higher safety stock needed for longer lead time against holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18: on-hand=0, in-transit=326. Historical concludes show an extended lead-time regime with recent observed lead_times = [3,2,3,2,2,3,2] (mean \u22482.43). To reflect persistent longer lead times I set L using recent_N (N=7) so the OR engine estimates demand over the longer review+lead horizon. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use default (all-sample mean/std scaled by 1+L) so the backend combines the full demand history with the inferred lead time; this balances service (via longer effective coverage) against holding cost given current large in-transit volume.

Carry-over insight: Extended lead-time regime persists; recent concluded lead_times (last 7) = [3,2,3,2,2,3,2], mean \u22482.43. Treat promised L=2 as understated until concludes show consistent return to 2.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19: on-hand=0, in-transit=368. Historical concluded lead_times show a persistent extended regime (recent concluded lead_times \u2248 [3,2,3,2,2,3,2], mean \u22482.43). Use L='calculate' to let backend average observed lead times (captures extended regime). Demand history (samples [112,97,116,138,94]) is limited and shows no clear recent shift, so use default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) to let backend compute demand across review+lead period robustly. This balances service level given longer effective lead time while avoiding overreacting to short-term noise; on-hand + in-transit (368) should cover multiple periods, so defaults keep orders moderated to limit holding cost.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_20 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=339. Historical concluded lead_times show persistent extended regime; recent 7 concluded lead_times = [3,2,3,2,2,3,2], mean \u22482.43. Demand history samples = [112,97,116,138,94] (mean \u2248111.4). To reflect the observed longer lead time while letting the OR engine compute demand across (1+L) periods from full history, I set L using recent_N (N=7) to capture the extended regime, and use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over all samples. This balances higher pipeline coverage due to longer lead times against holding costs given large in-transit inventory.

Carry-over insight: Extended lead-time regime persists; recent concluded lead_times (last 7) = [3,2,3,2,2,3,2], mean \u22482.43. Treat promised L=2 as understated until concludes show consistent return to 2.

I therefore set lead time using a recent average to reflect the longer effective lead time. Demand history (seed samples) is limited; use default population estimates for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine applies (1+L) scaling consistently. This balances service (capture extended L) while letting backend compute safety stock given profit/holding costs.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22: on-hand=0, in-transit=326. Historical concludes show a persistent extended lead-time regime (many orders arriving at 2\u20133 periods, occasional 1s). Recent concluded lead_times (most recent 7) = [3,2,3,2,2,3,2], mean \u2248 2.43. To capture the ongoing longer delivery times I set L via recent_N (N=7) so the OR engine plans for ~2.43 periods of lead. Demand forecasting uses default aggregation ((1+L)\xd7mean of all provided samples) to keep the forecast anchored to long-run sample mean while accounting for the longer lead+review period; sigma_hat stays default to scale variability by sqrt(1+L). This increases target pipeline coverage to reduce stockouts given delayed arrivals, while default mu/sigma keep volatility estimates tied to the full sample to avoid overreacting to short-term demand noise.

Carry-over insight: Extended lead-time persists; recent concluded lead_times (last 7) = [3,2,3,2,2,3,2], mean \u22482.43. Treat promised L=2 as understated until concludes show consistent return to 2.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:

I set L using recent_N with N=7 to reflect the longer realized lead time and ensure pipeline coverage. Demand statistics are sparse (historical samples), so use default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR engine applies its calibrated safety stock formula with the adjusted L. This approach increases ordered pipeline to cover the longer delivery delays while relying on backend's stock-sizing to balance service level vs holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Extended lead-time regime persists; recent concluded lead_times (last 7) = [3,2,3,2,2,3,2], mean \u22482.43. Treat promised L=2 as understated until concludes show consistent return to 2.

Set L via recent_N (N=7) to reflect observed regime. Use mu_hat default and sigma_hat default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples; this raises target base-stock to preserve service level under longer lead time while letting OR engine cap orders to limit holding cost given large in-transit volume.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period: Period_25. On-hand=0, in-transit=326. Historical concluded lead_times show a persistent extended-lead regime; recent concluded lead_times (last 7) = [3,2,3,2,2,3,2], mean \u22482.43. I choose L via recent_N to capture the shifted lead-time regime (N=7). Demand historical seed (small sample set) is used by default for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std; this balances higher pipeline coverage for the longer lead time while avoiding over-specifying demand shifts not yet proven in the demand series. The chosen parameters increase safety stock to cover the extended lead time while letting the OR engine cap orders to limit holding cost given current in-transit units.

Carry-over insight: Extended lead-time regime persists; recent concluded lead_times (last 7) = [3,2,3,2,2,3,2], mean \u22482.43. Treat promised L=2 as understated until conclude messages show consistent return to 2.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 26: on-hand=0, in-transit=326. Historical concludes show persistent extended lead-time regime; recent concluded lead_times (last 7) \u2248 [3,2,3,2,2,3,2] mean \u22482.43. To protect service while shipments remain delayed, set lead-time estimate using recent_N (N=7). Use default demand and volatility aggregation so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples given the stable demand history.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_27: on-hand=0, in-transit=326. Concluded lead-time history shows persistent extended lead-time regime; recent concluded lead_times (last 7) = [3,2,3,2,2,3,2], mean \u22482.43. I set L using recent_N to reflect the empirically longer lead time and keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR engine computes demand over the (1+L) review+lead horizon using all samples; this balances higher pipeline needs (to cover extended L) against holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Extended lead-time regime persists; recent concluded lead_times (last 7) = [3,2,3,2,2,3,2], mean \u22482.43. Treat promised L=2 as understated until conclude messages show consistent return to 2.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Extended lead-time regime persists (recent concluded lead_times last 7 \u2248 [3,2,3,2,2,3,2], mean \u22482.43). Use recent_N (N=7) for L to reflect observed slower arrivals. Demand samples are limited and stable around ~111 units mean (historical seed); use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std accordingly. On-hand=0 and in-transit=326; parameters chosen to let OR engine size orders accounting for longer realized lead time while relying on historical demand statistics to balance service vs holding cost.

I set L to recent_N (N=7) to reflect the longer realized lead time so the OR engine plans for (1+L) periods of demand. mu_hat and sigma_hat use default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from demand history, delivering a conservative base-stock that balances service level (reduce stockouts given overdue shipments) against holding cost.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================

Use recent_N for L (N=7) to capture this elevated lead time. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes demand over (1+L) using full sample history; this balances service (higher L increases required pipeline) vs holding cost given large in-transit stock and uncertain recovery to promised lead time.

Carry-over insight: Extended lead-time regime persists; recent concluded lead_times (last 7) = [3,2,3,2,2,3,2], mean \u22482.43. Treat promised L=2 as understated until conclude messages show consistent return to 2.

To protect service while avoiding excessive holding cost, set L to the observed extended lead time (explicit=2.43). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, leveraging full historical demand (samples provided) while the explicit L reflects delayed arrivals and reduces risk of stockouts.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:

Given many overdue shipments historically and large pipeline, set L to explicit estimate 2.43 to reflect realized delays. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes demand over review+lead using all samples; this balances service vs holding given elevated observed lead time and large in-transit stock.

Set L by recent_N (N=7) to reflect observed lead-time > promised so the OR engine sizes orders over the longer pipeline.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:

Current period 34. On-hand=0, in-transit=372 (large pipeline). Historical concluded lead_times (most recent 7) = [3,2,3,2,2,3,2], mean \u22482.43 indicating a persistent extended lead-time regime longer than the promised 2. Use recent_N for L (N=7) to reflect observed regime. Keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, letting the backend balance service vs holding cost given the longer inferred L and large in-transit pipeline.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35: on-hand=0, in-transit=372; historical concluded lead_times show a persistent extended regime (recent concluded lead_times \u2248 [3,2,3,2,2,3,2], mean \u22482.43). Many past orders were delayed or had lead_time>promised. To reflect the sustained longer lead time I set L by averaging the most recent 7 observed lead times (captures the documented regime). For demand I keep the default aggregation ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) to leverage full-sample stability given limited demand history; volatility uses default as well. This raises the pipeline coverage (1+L) and reduces risk of stockouts given large in-transit volume uncertainty and overdue shipments.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36: demand has been high and volatile with recent stockouts; on-hand=0, in-transit=366. Historical conclude messages show a persistent extended lead-time regime (recent concluded lead_times \u2248 [3,2,3,2,2,3,2], mean \u22482.43). To reflect the observed longer lead-time while letting the OR engine compute demand forecasts from full history, set lead time by averaging the last 7 observed lead times (recent_N N=7). Use default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples, keeping demand forecast stable while the longer L increases pipeline coverage to protect against outages.

Several orders have been delayed historically and current large in-transit suggests arrivals will materialize but with lead_time > promised. To account for this, set L using recent_N over the last 7 observed lead times so the OR engine plans for the longer effective lead time. Demand sample set is limited to the provided historical samples; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting the OR engine apply its capped policy. This balances higher safety stock from longer L against holding cost while relying on the OR engine's statistical cap to avoid extreme overordering.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39: on-hand=0, in-transit=366. Historical concluded lead_times show a persistent extended regime (recent concluded lead_times mean \u22482.43). To protect service given many overdue/slow arrivals, set lead-time estimate based on recent concluded lead_times (N=7). Use default demand aggregation ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and default volatility so the OR backend applies the adjusted review+lead horizon consistently to base-stock while keeping variance estimation broad from full history.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 with on-hand=0 and in-transit=366. Historical concludes show a persistent extended lead-time regime (recent concluded lead_times cluster around 2\u20133, prior analysis used last 7 => mean \u22482.43). To be conservative and cover pipeline uncertainty, I estimate L using the recent lead-time regime (recent_N=7). Demand history is limited; use default demand aggregation so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples. Use default volatility so backend scales std by sqrt(1+L). This increases protection against stockouts given long/variable lead times while letting OR backend cap orders.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_41: on-hand=0, in-transit=366. Historical concl. show persistent extended lead-time (recent concluded lead_times = [3,2,3,2,2,3,2], mean \u22482.43). To protect service while avoiding excess holding, estimate lead time from recent concluded samples (recent_N, N=7). Use default demand/volatility aggregation so backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples consistently with the chosen L.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42: on-hand=0, in-transit=366. Historical concluded lead_times show a persistent extended regime (mix of 2s and 3s; recent 7 mean \u22482.43). Demand context: baseline samples available (past demands [112,97,116,138,94]) and recent periods show continued high single-period demand spikes. Reconciliation: large pipeline (366) likely covers multiple future periods given extended L; avoid over-ordering while respecting delayed arrivals. Choices: set L using recent_N (N=7) to capture the sustained extended lead-time regime; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from full sample set, letting OR engine produce a capped order that balances service vs holding given current large in-transit volume. This addresses missing/late shipments by explicitly increasing L estimate while keeping demand estimates conservative.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43: on-hand=0, in-transit=366. Historical concludes show a persistent extended lead-time regime (recent concluded lead_times = [3,2,3,2,2,3,2], mean \u22482.43). Several earlier orders were overdue before eventually arriving, so promised L=2 understates true delivery delay. I set L explicitly to the observed extended lead-time (2.43) so the OR engine plans for a longer pipeline; mu_hat and sigma_hat use defaults to apply (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting the backend combine the extended review+lead period with historical demand variability. This balances service level (by provisioning for longer delays) against holding cost using the backend's capped ordering rule.

Carry-over insight: Extended lead-time regime persists; recent concluded lead_times (last 7) = [3,2,3,2,2,3,2], mean \u22482.43. Treat promised L=2 as understated until concludes show consistent return to 2.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44: on-hand=0, in-transit=369. Historical concluded lead_times show a persistent extended regime with recent concluded lead_times \u2248 [3,2,3,2,2,3,2] (mean \u22482.43). To protect service given large in-transit but uncertain arrival timing, I set lead time using recent_N=7 to reflect the longer realized lead time. For demand, use default aggregation ((1+L)\xd7mean of all seed samples) so the OR backend applies the standard forecast across available demand history. Volatility left to default so backend scales std by sqrt(1+L). These settings bias orders upward vs. promised L=2 to avoid stockouts while keeping sigma-driven safety stock for variability.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45. On-hand=0, in-transit=369. Historical conclude messages show a persistent extended lead-time regime; the most recent 7 concluded lead_times = [3,2,3,2,2,3,2], mean \u22482.43. To reflect the longer effective lead time I set L using recent_N (N=7). I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default ((1+L)\xd7mean of demand samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR engine computes demand across review+lead using all available demand history while respecting the adjusted lead time. This balances service level (by increasing pipeline coverage for the longer L) against holding cost via the backend's capped ordering policy.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 46: on-hand=0, in-transit=369. Historical concludes consistently show an extended lead-time regime (recent concluded lead_times sequence \u2248 [3,2,3,2,2,3,2], mean \u22482.43). To protect service given overdue shipments, set L using recent_N=7 to reflect the recent observed lead-time average. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes demand across (1+L) using all demand samples; this balances service level uplift from longer effective lead time while keeping volatility estimation stable.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47: on-hand=0, in-transit=366. Historical concludes show a persistent extended lead-time regime; recent concluded lead_times (last 7) = [3,2,3,2,2,3,2], mean \u22482.43. I set L using recent_N (N=7) to reflect the empirically longer lead time rather than the promised L=2. For demand parameters I use default aggregation so OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances higher pipeline requirements from longer lead time while keeping demand estimate stable given noisy zeros in many recent periods. This approach reduces risk of stockouts from underestimated lead time while avoiding overreacting to short-term demand spikes.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 48. On-hand=0, in-transit=366. History of conclude messages shows a persistent extended lead-time regime; recent concluded lead_times (last 7) = [3,2,3,2,2,3,2], mean \u22482.43. I set L using recent_N with N=7 to reflect the empirically longer lead time so the OR backend sizes orders over the true pipeline horizon. mu_hat and sigma_hat use default rules so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, preserving statistical pooling given limited demand data. This balances higher pipeline coverage (to avoid stockouts from delayed arrivals) against holding cost by relying on the OR engine's z*-based safety stock.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 49: on-hand=0, in-transit=366. Historical conclude messages show a persistent extended lead-time regime with recent observed lead_times (last 7 concluded) = [3,2,3,2,2,3,2], mean \u22482.43. To reflect the extended regime I set L via recent_N=7 so the OR backend averages the most recent 7 observed lead times. Demand statistics are noisy but no clear recent demand mean shift beyond sample noise, so use default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and default volatility; this biases orders upward to cover the longer effective pipeline while letting the OR engine compute safety stock via its profit/holding tradeoff.

Carry-over insight: Extended lead-time regime persists; recent concluded lead_times (last 7) = [3,2,3,2,2,3,2], mean \u22482.43. Treat promised L=2 as understated until concludes show consistent return to 2.

I set L via recent_N (N=7) to reflect the empirically longer lead time and avoid under-ordering. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to base mu_hat on the most relevant demand samples; sigma_hat uses default to let backend scale variability with (1+L). These choices balance higher safety-stock from longer lead time against holding cost given profit=2 and holding=1.
