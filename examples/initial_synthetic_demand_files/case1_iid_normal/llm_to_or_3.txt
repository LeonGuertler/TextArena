Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. No on-hand or in-transit inventory; no concluded arrivals observed yet. Use promised lead time and historical demand samples (5 points: [112,97,116,138,94]) as the best prior. No evidence of changepoint or lost shipments yet, so use default calculations to let the OR engine compute base-stock, balancing $2 profit vs $1 holding cost.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_2: on-hand=0, in-transit=141 (Period 1 order) and no concluded arrivals yet\u2014no observed lead-time samples. Historical demand samples = [112,97,116,138,94], mean=111.4, std\u224815.74. Because no concluded lead-time evidence and one recent order remains in-transit (possible normal 2-period lead time), use promised lead time. Use default demand/volatility calculations ((1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR engine applies its standard base-stock and cap formulas while accounting for 3-period coverage (review+L). This keeps service level aligned with profit/holding tradeoff while avoiding overreaction to the missing arrival (which is expected under promised L=2).

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3 start. Historical demands: [112,97,116,138,94] (mean=111.4). On-hand=0, in-transit=278 (sum of prior orders 141+137) and no concluded arrivals yet. Promised lead time=2 and there is insufficient evidence (no concluded arrivals) to override it; shipments may still be in transit. Use default lead time so backend uses promised L=2. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample; this keeps forecasting conservative while the pipeline is monitored for overdue/lost arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_4 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=332 (sum of orders 141+137+54). No concluded arrivals in any conclude messages, so actual lead time cannot be inferred from history; shipments are outstanding but not confirmed arrived. I therefore keep L at the promised/default to avoid overreacting to missing conclude messages. Historical demand mean = 111.4 (samples [112,97,116,138,94]); using default mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the OR backend compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std, which yields a target similar to outstanding pipeline (~332) and balances service level vs holding cost conservatively given uncertain arrivals.

Daily Profit: $248.00, Daily Holding Cost: $154.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $94.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_5 context: recent concluded arrivals show orders from Period1 (lead_time=3) and Period2 (lead_time=2) \u2014 average observed lead time is 2.5. Order from Period3 has not concluded and may be delayed/lost, so assume longer/variable lead times. Use L='calculate' to let backend average observed lead times; keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as 'default' so demand forecast uses all samples scaled by (1+L) the backend computes. This balances service level (accounting for longer lead times) against holding cost given current high on-hand (154) + in-transit (59).

Carry-over insight: Observed lead times: Period1\u21923, Period2\u21922 (avg 2.5); Period3 order not arrived by Period4 conclude \u2014 possible delayed/lost shipment. Treat lead time regime as lengthened/variable until further concludes confirm.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-1.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_6: on-hand=103, in-transit=199. Historical concluded arrivals show lead_times 3 (Period1\u21924) and 2 (Period2\u21924) \u2192 average 2.5; Period3 order still unarrived by Period5 conclude (possible delay/loss). Demand history [112,97,116,138,94] used as baseline. Given observed longer/variable lead times, set L method to 'calculate' (uses average of observed lead times = 2.5) so the backend recognizes the longer regime. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples are applied, preserving demand baseline while letting increased L inflate coverage for the pipeline to protect against delayed/lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime lengthened/variable: observed lead_times = 3 (Period1\u21924) and 2 (Period2\u21924), avg 2.5; Period3 order not arrived by Period5 conclude \u2192 possible delayed/lost shipment. Treat lead time as increased/variable until further concludes confirm.

Daily Profit: $134.00, Daily Holding Cost: $90.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $44.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_7: on-hand=90, in-transit=279. Observed concluded lead_times = 3 (P1\u2192P4), 2 (P2\u2192P4), 3 (P3\u2192P6) \u2192 recent average \u22482.67; several earlier orders delayed but P3 eventually arrived at LT=3, so treat lead time as lengthened/variable. Demand recent sequence (Periods 4-6) = [124,51,67] indicating a lower recent mean than older samples. To balance service vs holding cost: set L to recent_N (capture current longer/variable lead time), set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=3) to reflect the recent lower mean and volatility so orders don't overstock given substantial in-transit pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime lengthened/variable; observed lead_times = 3 (P1\u2192P4), 2 (P2\u2192P4), 3 (P3\u2192P6); recent average \u22482.67. Treat LT as increased/variable until further concludes confirm.

Recent history shows a lengthened/variable lead-time regime and at least one delayed shipment earlier, so set L to the observed average (calculate) so the OR engine accounts for longer/variable LT. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given the inferred longer lead time.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9. Current on-hand=169, in-transit=147. Historical concluded arrivals give observed lead_times = 3 (P1\u2192P4), 2 (P2\u2192P4), 3 (P3\u2192P6), 2 (P5\u2192P7), 2 (P6\u2192P8) \u2192 average \u22482.4. Several early orders were delayed but recent concludes show many 2-period arrivals; lead time regime is lengthened and variable. Use 'calculate' for L to let backend average observed lead times. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend sets (1+L)*mean_demand and sqrt(1+L)*std using all samples (demand samples: [112,97,116,138,94]). This balances service level (accounting for longer/variable L) with holding cost given high on-hand + in-transit; defaults keep forecasting anchored to full history while L captures the increased lead time risk.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime lengthened/variable; observed lead_times = [3 (P1\u2192P4),2 (P2\u2192P4),3 (P3\u2192P6),2 (P5\u2192P7),2 (P6\u2192P8)], recent average \u22482.4. Treat LT as increased and variable until further concludes confirm.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10: on-hand=69, in-transit=223. Historical concluded lead_times = [3 (P1\u2192P4),2 (P2\u2192P4),3 (P3\u2192P6),2 (P5\u2192P7),2 (P6\u2192P8)] -> recent average = 2.4. Several early orders experienced 3-period delays and some variability; risk of further delayed/lost shipments remains. Choose L via recent_N (N=5) to capture the recent stretched/variable lead-time regime. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, allowing the OR engine to scale orders for the longer effective lead time while retaining historical demand stats. This balances higher safety stock from longer L against holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime remains lengthened and variable; observed lead_times = [3,2,3,2,2], recent average \u22482.4 \u2014 treat LT as increased/variable until further concludes confirm.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 11. Observed concluded lead times from history: P1\u2192P4=3, P2\u2192P4=2, P3\u2192P6=3, P5\u2192P7=2, P6\u2192P8=2, P8\u2192P10=2 (avg \u22482.33). Some earlier orders showed delays/loss risk but recent arrivals are mostly 2 with occasional 3, indicating a lengthened/variable lead-time regime. On-hand=132, in-transit=147 provides coverage but variability argues for using an averaged observed LT. I set L to the calculated average of observed lead times to capture the current longer/variable lead-time regime; mu_hat and sigma_hat use defaults so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, preserving robustness given modest demand history.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime remains lengthened/variable; observed concluded lead_times = [3,2,3,2,2,2], recent average \u22482.33. Treat LT as increased/variable until further concludes confirm.

Use calculated average lead time to reflect observed regime. Keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default (use all samples) so the OR backend bases the base-stock on full-sample mean/variance scaled by (1+L); this leverages observed LT while remaining conservative given large in-transit pipeline and variable arrivals.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_13: on-hand=0, in-transit=288. Historical concluded lead_times = [3 (P1\u2192P4),2 (P2\u2192P4),3 (P3\u2192P6),2 (P5\u2192P7),2 (P6\u2192P8),2 (P8\u2192P10),3 (P9\u2192P12)] \u2192 recent average \u22482.43. Several earlier orders were delayed or long-lived in-transit; treat lead time as lengthened/variable to avoid underordering. I set L explicitly to the observed recent average (2.43) so the OR backend computes (1+L)-horizon demand correctly despite promised=2. For demand and volatility I use default methods so backend uses all samples scaled by (1+L); this is conservative given limited demand history and avoids overfitting to short-term noise. This balances service level (capture longer/variable lead time) versus holding cost by increasing coverage horizon while letting OR compute safety stock from full-sample variance.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime remains lengthened and variable; concluded lead_times = [3,2,3,2,2,2,3], recent average \u22482.43. Treat LT as increased/variable until further concludes confirm.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:

Concluded lead-times recent series \u2248 [3,2,3,2,2,2,3], recent average \u22482.43 \u2192 evidence of a lengthened, variable lead-time regime.

Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this keeps forecasts grounded in full sample while the increased L raises coverage for the longer lead time and the capped order cap limits excess ordering given high pipeline inventory.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 with on-hand=0 and in-transit=256. Historical concluded lead_times = [3,2,3,2,2,2,3,2] (avg \u22482.375) and several prior late/non-concluded orders indicate a lengthened, variable lead-time regime. I select L=calculate to let the backend use observed average lead time. Demand samples are limited (seed samples provided); use mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, which balances service level against holding cost while reflecting the longer/variable lead time and existing pipeline. This approach is robust to potential lost shipments because it increases coverage via the inferred longer L without overfitting short-term noise.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time remains lengthened and variable; concluded lead_times = [3,2,3,2,2,2,3,2], recent average \u22482.38 \u2014 treat LT as increased/variable until further concludes confirm.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period=16. On-hand=0, in-transit=379. Concluded lead_times from history = [3,2,3,2,2,2,3,2] (Periods1,2,3,5,6,8,9,12 arrivals) \u2192 recent average \u22482.38, indicating a lengthened/variable lead-time regime. To reflect this, set L using recent_N with N=8 to capture the most recent lead-time behavior. Demand history samples = [112,97,116,138,94]; no clear demand regime shift, so use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). These settings increase pipeline cover for the longer, variable lead time while letting the OR engine compute safety stock consistent with profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent concluded arrivals show a persistent lengthened/variable lead time (many concluded Ls = 3,2,3,2,2,2,3,2; recent average \u22482.38) and several overdue/no-arrival events in latest concludes. To be conservative versus the promised L=2, I set an explicit lead time of 2.4 to capture increased transit variability. Using that L, I set mu_hat explicit to (1+L)*mean(demand) \u2248 379 units to cover the review+lead demand given the observed mean demand (mean=111.4) and elevated LT; sigma_hat explicit \u224832.5 reflects sqrt(1+L)*std(demand) scaling of empirical std (~17.6) to capture demand variability for safety stock. These explicit values bias orders upward to avoid stockouts given in-transit uncertainty while balancing holding cost.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_18: on-hand=14, in-transit=270. Historical concluded lead_times = [3(P1\u21924),2(P2\u21924),3(P3\u21926),2(P5\u21927),2(P6\u21928),3(P9\u219212),2(P12\u219214),2(P15\u219217)] \u2192 recent avg \u22482.38. Several earlier orders were delayed/lost before concluding, so treat lead time as lengthened and variable. Set L explicitly to 2.38 to reflect the observed regime. Use default demand sizing (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and default sigma (backend computes sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR engine uses full historical demand while accounting for longer lead time. This balances service (larger base stock due to longer L) against holding cost given high in-transit inventory.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime remains lengthened and variable; concluded lead_times (most recent eight) = [3,2,3,2,2,3,2,2], recent average \u22482.38. Treat LT as increased/variable until further concludes confirm.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Concluded lead-times recent eight = [3,2,3,2,2,3,2,2] \u2192 recent average \u22482.38 and regime is lengthened/variable with occasional 3-period delays and possible lost shipments. Set L using recent_N to capture the stretched/variable lead-time distribution (N=8). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample set, letting it scale safety stock with the inferred longer lead time while capping orders per its cap constraint.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime lengthened and variable; concluded lead_times (most recent eight) = [3,2,3,2,2,3,2,2], recent average \u22482.38 \u2014 treat LT as increased/variable until further concludes confirm.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20. Recent demand samples: [112,97,116,138,94], mean=111.4. On-hand=0, in-transit=279 (some past shipments delayed historically). Historical concluded lead_times are variable and lengthened; recent 8 concluded lead_times average \u22482.38, indicating sustained longer/variable lead time and some lost/delayed shipments. I choose L as recent_N with N=8 to capture the recently observed longer, variable lead-time regime. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting the OR engine scale demand span with the inferred L. This balances higher safety stock (to cover longer lead time) against holding cost while acknowledging pipeline (279) is likely insufficient for (1+L)\xd7mean demand.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_21: on-hand=0, in-transit=326. Historical concluded lead_times show a sustained lengthened/variable regime (recent average \u22482.38) with multiple delayed arrivals and occasional 3-periods. To avoid stockouts given visible in-transit but persistent delays, set L explicit to the inferred recent average (2.38). Demand history shows no clear downward/upward shift (samples: [112,97,116,138,94]); use default demand aggregation so backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean. Volatility likewise use default.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime remains lengthened and variable; recent concluded lead_times (most recent eight) \u22482.38 \u2014 treat LT as increased/variable until further concludes confirm.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 22. On-hand=0, in-transit=361. Historical concluded lead-times show a lengthened, variable regime (recent average \u22482.38). Demand recently (Periods17-21) averaged ~100.2 units. To protect against the longer/variable lead time, I explicitly set L above the promised value and use recent demand estimates (most recent 5 periods) for mu and sigma so the base-stock reflects the current regime and recent demand variability while avoiding bias from older data.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime remains lengthened and variable; recent concluded lead_times (most recent eight) \u22482.38 \u2014 treat LT as increased/variable until further concludes confirm.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 23: on-hand=0, in-transit=361. Historical concluded lead times show a prolonged, lengthened and variable regime (recent average \u22482.38 over most recent 8 concludes). To account for stretched/variable lead time I set L using a recent-window average (N=8). Demand historical seed (provided samples) shows no clear, persistent mean shift beyond those samples, so mu_hat and sigma_hat use default computation ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) so the OR engine retains its statistical forecast while L reflects the longer/variable lead time. This balances service level (by raising pipeline coverage through larger L) versus holding cost (mu/sigma unchanged avoids over-inflating forecasts given large in-transit already).

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime remains lengthened and variable; recent concluded lead_times (most recent eight) = [3,2,3,2,2,3,2,2], recent average \u22482.38 \u2014 treat LT as increased/variable until further concludes confirm.

Concluded lead-times show a persistent lengthened/variable regime with recent observed average \u22482.38 (most recent 8 concluded lead_times = [3,2,3,2,2,3,2,2]). To capture the longer, variable lead-time I set L via recent_N (N=8) so the OR engine plans across the empirically observed LT regime. I retain default demand and volatility aggregation so the backend computes mu_hat and sigma_hat as (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples) respectively; with large pipeline on-hand + in-transit is sufficient now so we avoid overreacting to short-term demand noise while covering the longer lead-time risk.

LLM Rationale:
Period 26. On-hand=0, in-transit=326. Historical concluded lead_times remain lengthened/variable with recent average \u22482.38 (useful evidence from multiple concluded messages). Flag overdue/lost shipments in past; therefore use an explicit lead-time estimate longer than promised to force the OR engine to hold more pipeline cover. Set L explicit to 2.38 to reflect the observed regime. Use default mu_hat and default sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples\u2014this leverages full historical demand (no strong recent demand changepoint) while the explicit L addresses the prolonged/variable lead-time risk and balances service level vs holding cost.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27. Recent concluded lead-times have been lengthened and variable (recent average \u22482.38); several earlier orders were delayed or lost, so assume extended lead time this period. On-hand=0, in-transit=359 \u2014 large pipeline but arrivals are not yet concluded; treat pipeline as covering several future periods but still account for longer lead time. Set L explicitly to 2.38 to reflect the observed prolonged/variable regime. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this scales demand forecast and volatility appropriately for the longer effective replenishment period and balances service vs. holding given high in-transit volume.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28: on-hand=0, in-transit=359. Historical concluded lead-times show a lengthened/variable regime; recent 8 concluded lead_times \u22482.38. To capture the longer, variable LT I set L using recent_N (N=8). Demand history is stable around ~100 units; I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, while the increased L raises coverage for the longer lead time. Large in-transit inventory reduces stockout risk despite longer L; this conservative LT estimate addresses potential delayed/lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime lengthened and variable; recent concluded lead_times (most recent eight) = [3,2,3,2,2,3,2,2], recent average \u22482.38. Treat LT as increased/variable until further concludes confirm.

I set L using recent_N (N=8) to capture the current stretched lead-time regime.

I choose N=8 (captures the most recent stable window reported in carry-over). Given this L choice, use default demand/volatility aggregation so the OR backend computes mu_hat=(1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This balances service (accounting for longer/variable lead time) against holding costs while leveraging all demand history for demand mean/variance estimates. Monitor future concludes for confirmations of lead-time normalization or lost shipments.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31. On-hand=0, in-transit=359 \u2014 large pipeline but no on-hand stock. Historical concluded lead-times show a persistent, lengthened/variable regime with recent average \u22482.38 periods; several orders were delayed/lost in earlier periods. To ensure the OR backend accounts for the longer observed lead time I set L explicitly to the recent empirical average (2.38). Demand history provided (seed samples) is limited; I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples, letting the engine compute the required base-stock while my explicit L corrects for the lengthened lead-time. This balances higher safety-stock needs from longer LT against holding cost, and the large in-transit quantity reduces need for aggressive additional orders this period.

Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std on the canonical demand samples; this balances service (higher L \u2192 larger base stock) against holding cost while relying on backend demand stats.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33. On-hand=0, in-transit=361 (large pipeline). Historical concluded lead-times show a sustained lengthened/variable regime; most recent eight concluded lead_times = [3,2,3,2,2,3,2,2], recent average \u22482.38. Several earlier orders were delayed or never concluded, so I treat lead time as increased and variable. I set L using recent_N (N=8) to reflect the current observed regime. I leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR engine uses all demand samples with the chosen L to compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std; with large in-transit inventory this avoids over-ordering while accounting for longer lead time. This balances service (longer L \u2192 larger base stock) versus holding cost given existing pipeline and past lost/delayed shipments.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime remains lengthened and variable; most recent eight concluded lead_times = [3,2,3,2,2,3,2,2], recent average \u22482.38. Treat LT as increased/variable until further concludes confirm.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34: on-hand=0, in-transit=361. History shows multiple concluded lead times longer than promised 2 (recent 8-period average \u22482.38) and several late/unconcluded shipments \u2014 treat LT as lengthened/variable. I set L using recent_N (N=8) to reflect the empirically observed stretched lead-time regime. Demand forecast (mu_hat) uses default (all-sample mean scaled by 1+L) because only five seed demand samples are provided and no clear recent demand mean regime shift is supported beyond the lead-time signal. Volatility (sigma_hat) uses default so the OR engine derives uncertainty from full sample std scaled by sqrt(1+L). This increases pipeline coverage for the longer/variable lead time while keeping demand forecast conservative given limited demand-sample evidence.

To hedge variable/longer lead time I set L using a recent average of the last 8 observed lead times. I leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR backend computes demand over (1+L) using the full sample statistics; this keeps demand sizing driven by the data while the longer L increases coverage for delayed arrivals and reduces stockout risk given high in-transit and prior lost shipments.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39: on-hand=0, in-transit=361. Historical concluded lead_times show a lengthened, variable regime with recent most-recent-eight average \u22482.38 and some delayed/lost shipments. To reflect that persistence I set L via recent_N=8 to capture the current stretched lead-time distribution. I leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the demand samples, giving a conservative base-stock that accounts for the longer review+lead period while letting the backend apply its service-level cap. This balances higher safety stock (to protect service given large in-transit and missed arrivals) against holding cost.

Set L via recent_N (N=8) to capture the longer observed lead time.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41: on-hand=0, in-transit=361. Historical concluded lead-times show a persistent lengthened/variable regime (recent 8 concluded LT values \u2248 [3,2,3,2,2,3,2,2], avg \u22482.38). Demand has been relatively stable around ~90\u2013130 recently but exhibits occasional spikes; use recent-sample estimates to capture current regime. Choose L as recent_N (N=8) to reflect the empirically lengthened/variable lead time. Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=8 to base the review+lead forecast and volatility on the most recent demand regime so the OR engine sizes base-stock appropriately given longer/variable lead time and current demand pattern. This balances service (covering (1+L) periods of demand) against holding cost while acknowledging in-transit inventory already on the way.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime lengthened and variable; most recent eight concluded lead_times = [3,2,3,2,2,3,2,2], recent average \u22482.38. Treat LT as increased/variable until further concludes confirm.

To capture the longer/variable transit delays I set L via recent_N using the last 8 observed lead times. Given a large pipeline and to let the OR engine balance service vs holding cost using its statistical priors, I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This avoids over-ordering while accounting for the increased lead time.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_47: on-hand=0, in-transit=362. Historical sample mean=111.4 (from [112,97,116,138,94]). Many concluded arrivals show a lengthened, variable lead-time regime (recent average \u22482.38). With L\u22482.38, the replenishment horizon (1+L\u22483.38) implied demand \u2248376 units, so current pipeline (362) is slightly short of the (1+L)\xd7mean anchor \u2014 risk of stockouts if demand follows history. Several past orders were delayed or lost, so I set L explicitly to reflect the longer/variable lead time; I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR engine uses the (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std calculations, letting its capped policy control order sizing given statistical uncertainty and caps.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime remains lengthened and variable; most recent concluded lead_times (most recent eight) = [3,2,3,2,2,3,2,2], recent average \u22482.38; treat LT as increased/variable until further concludes confirm.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period_49 decision: on-hand=0, in-transit=362. Historical concluded lead-times show a sustained lengthened/variable regime (recent average \u22482.38). To protect against delayed arrivals while avoiding excessive holding cost, I set lead time > promised. I use explicit L=2.38 to reflect the empirically observed regime; mu_hat and sigma_hat use defaults so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, preserving sample-based demand signal while the increased L inflates required pipeline cover.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime remains lengthened and variable; recent concluded lead_times (most recent eight) = [3,2,3,2,2,3,2,2], recent average \u22482.38. Treat LT as increased/variable until further concludes confirm.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 50: on-hand=0, in-transit=364. Historical concluded lead times show a persistent lengthened/variable regime (most recent 8 concluded LTs \u22482.38). Several past orders were delayed/lost, so use a recent-average lead time estimate to reflect current variability. Choices: L set to recent_N (N=8) to capture the most recent lead-time regime; mu_hat set to default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean(all demand samples) using that inferred L; sigma_hat set to default so backend computes sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples). This increases the base-stock to cover the longer, variable lead time while letting the OR engine cap orders per its safety-cap policy, balancing service level vs holding cost given large in-transit stock.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime lengthened and variable; most recent eight concluded lead_times = [3,2,3,2,2,3,2,2], recent average \u22482.38. Treat LT as increased/variable until further concludes confirm.
