Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. No on-hand or in-transit inventory and no concluded arrivals to infer lead time. Use promised lead time (default) and default demand estimates based on all historical samples [112,97,116,138,94] so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This keeps parameters conservative until arrival/lead-time evidence appears.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_2: on-hand=0, in-transit=141, recent observed demand samples=[112,97,116,138,94] (mean=111.4). The Period_1 conclude shows the Period_1 order has not arrived (arrived=0) but there are no concluded arrivals to infer actual lead time yet, so stick with promised lead time. Use default demand/volatility aggregation to let the OR engine compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This balances avoiding premature manual adjustments while the shipment status and lead time remain ambiguous.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3 with on-hand=0 and in-transit=278. Two prior conclude messages show zero arrivals for recent orders (Period 1 and 2), indicating overdue shipments but no concluded lead-time observations. Use promised lead time (default) since no concluded arrived messages give actual lead time. Demand history samples = [112,97,116,138,94]; no clear recent changepoint, so use population-statistics defaults: mu_hat default = (1+L)*mean(all samples) to provide coverage over review+lead periods and sigma_hat default = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples) to capture observed variability. This balances service level vs holding cost given current uncertainty and pending in-transit units.

Carry-over insight: Possible lost/overdue shipments: orders placed in Periods 1\u20132 have not concluded (arrived=0 in Period 1 and 2 concludes); monitor for missing conclude messages as signal of lost shipments.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_4: recent concludes show no arrivals for orders placed in Periods 1\u20133 (arrived=0), indicating shipments are overdue or lost. On-hand=0, in-transit=332 units (some of which may never conclude). To protect service while shipments are delayed, I set lead time longer than the promised 2 periods to reflect the observed delay. I choose L explicit=4 to cover extended arrival risk and give the OR engine a conservative review+lead window. For demand I use default aggregation so mu_hat = (1+L) \xd7 mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L) \xd7 std(all samples), leveraging all five historical demands [112,97,116,138,94] to stabilize forecasts despite the disrupted pipeline. This raises target base-stock to maintain service given possible lost shipments while letting the capped-order logic limit oversized replenishment.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed overdue/lost shipments: orders from Periods 1\u20133 not concluded (Period_1 conclude arrived=0 for order 141; Period_2 conclude arrived=0 for order 137; Period_3 conclude arrived=0 for order 54). Treat lead time as lengthened until conclusions resume.

Daily Profit: $248.00, Daily Holding Cost: $154.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $94.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 start. History shows concluded arrivals in Period 4: order from P1 arrived with lead_time=3, order from P2 arrived with lead_time=2; P3 order (54) still not concluded. This indicates lead time has lengthened and is variable. I set L using recent_N (N=2) to average the two observed lead times (2 and 3) to reflect current longer/variable lead time. For demand, I use recent_N with N=5 (all samples [112,97,116,138,94]) so mu_hat reflects the full-sample mean scaled by (1+L) computed by the backend. Sigma_hat uses default so the backend scales sample std by sqrt(1+L). These choices balance higher coverage for longer/variable lead time while avoiding overreacting to a single missing shipment; they prompt the OR engine to increase pipeline targets to cover the extended lead time noted in concludes.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed extended/overdue lead times: arrivals show P1\u2192lead_time=3 and P2\u2192lead_time=2; P3 order still unconfirmed (possible lost/very long lead time). Treat lead time regime as lengthened until further concludes resume.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-1.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_6 decision. On-hand=103, in-transit=278. Concluded arrivals show actual lead times of 3 (Period1) and 2 (Period2); Period3 order still unconfirmed, indicating a lengthened/variable lead-time regime. Use L='calculate' to let backend average observed lead times (captures recent elongation). Use mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' so demand forecasts scale with the inferred L and historical demand samples, increasing pipeline coverage (covers (1+L) periods) to mitigate missed/overdue shipments while balancing holding cost.

Daily Profit: $134.00, Daily Holding Cost: $90.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $44.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_7: recent demand history (samples [112,97,116,138,94], mean=113.4) shows no clear demand regime shift. Concluded arrivals reveal realized lead times: P1\u21923, P2\u21922, P3\u21923 (avg=2.67). On-hand=90, in-transit=279; several earlier overdue shipments have now concluded, explaining the large pipeline. Because actual lead time has lengthened above the promised 2 and the backend expects an L estimate, I choose L='calculate' so backend uses observed average lead time. For demand parameters I use default methods ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) to let backend scale demand over the review+lead period using full history. This balances service (larger base stock because L>promised) versus holding cost given high on-hand and pipeline; using backend defaults keeps estimates robust to limited samples and lets the OR cap limit excessive orders.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed lengthened lead-time regime: observed lead times P1=3, P2=2, P3=3 \u2192 avg \u22482.67; treat lead time as extended until further conclude messages indicate normalization.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_8: on-hand=72, in-transit=248. History shows multiple delayed arrivals with observed lead times [3,2,3,2] \u2192 avg=2.5; recent concludes confirm a lengthened lead-time regime and some earlier lost/overdue shipments. To reflect realized lead time I set L by averaging observed lead times (method=calculate). Demand samples [112,97,116,138,94] show no clear changepoint in demand magnitude; use default demand aggregation so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples). Volatility appears stable\u2014use default sigma_hat to scale std by sqrt(1+L). These choices push the OR backend to hold more pipeline to cover the extended lead time while using historical mean/variance to balance service level vs holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $149.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_9 context: on-hand=35, in-transit=282, demands history [112,97,116,138,94]. Multiple conclude messages show lead times longer than promised (observed lead_times = 3,2,3,2,2). I set L to be calculated from observed concludes to capture the current extended lead-time regime. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this scales forecast and variability with the inferred longer lead time. This balances service (higher base stock for longer L) against holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed extended lead-time regime: observed lead_times = 3 (P1), 2 (P2), 3 (P3), 2 (P5), 2 (P6) \u2192 average lead_time \u22482.4; treat lead time as lengthened until concludes normalize.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_10: on-hand=0, in-transit=357. Historical concludes show multiple overdue/extended shipments with observed lead_times = 3 (P1),2 (P2),3 (P3),2 (P5),2 (P6) \u2192 recent average \u22482.4. Demand has moderated recently (most recent 5 concluded demands P5\u2013P9 = 51,67,103,92,100; mean\u224882.6) so I use recent-window estimates to capture the shifted lead-time regime and current demand level. Setting L via recent_N (last 5 observed lead times) lets the OR engine size pipeline for the extended lead-time; using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat (last 5 demands) updates the (1+L) demand forecast and volatility to recent lower/mid demand, balancing service level vs holding cost given large in-transit stock.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed extended lead-time regime: observed lead_times = [3,2,3,2,2] (Periods 1,2,3,5,6) \u2192 recent average \u22482.4; treat lead time as lengthened until concludes normalize.

I set L using recent_N to capture the extended lead-time regime. Demand history (samples mean \u2248111.4) is stable enough to use default aggregation for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std; this balances service level (cover extended pipeline) versus holding cost given current on-hand=64 and in-transit=214.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12. Recent demand samples = [112,97,116,138,94]; on-hand=0, in-transit=309. Concluded arrivals show variable but persistently lengthened lead times (observed lead_times = [3,2,3,2,2,3,2] \u2192 avg \u22482.43). Several recent orders (e.g. Period 11 ordered=95) remain unarrived, supporting extended lead-time regime. To reflect realized lead times I set L to the calculated average from observed concludes. For demand forecasts I use defaults so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std, which balances service level (captures longer pipeline needs) against holding cost given current high in-transit. This keeps parameters responsive to the confirmed extended lead-time regime while letting the OR backend apply its capped ordering rule.

Given repeated extended/variable lead times and outstanding pipeline, set L by averaging observed lead times so the OR engine plans over the longer regime; use default aggregation for demand (backend will scale (1+L)\xd7mean) and default volatility to reflect full-sample uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed lengthened lead-time regime: observed lead_times = [3,2,3,2,2,3,2,3] (Periods 1,2,3,5,6,7,8,9) \u2192 recent average lead_time \u22482.5; treat lead time as extended until conclude messages normalize.

Historical concludes show a sustained lengthened lead-time regime (observed lead_times: 3,2,3,2,2,3,2,3 \u2192 recent average \u22482.5) and some lost/overdue shipments earlier; treat lead time as extended. I set L explicitly to 2.5 to reflect the prolonged lead-time regime so the OR engine plans across the longer pipeline. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, allowing standard demand uncertainty treatment while accounting for the longer effective review+lead period.

Use 'calculate' for L to let backend average observed lead times. Demand history mean from samples is stable (mean of [112,97,116,138,94]=111.4); use default mu_hat and default sigma_hat ((1+L) scaling) so the OR engine computes base_stock using observed demand stats while accounting for the lengthened lead time estimate.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17: on-hand=0, in-transit=392. Historical concluded arrivals show consistently extended lead times (observed lead_times = [3,2,3,2,2,3,2,3,2], avg \u22482.44). Several orders previously delayed or lost motivate using the empirically observed lead time rather than the promised 2. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the average observed lead time. Demand history (samples [112,97,116,138,94]) shows no clear recent regime shift; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR engine adjusts quantities for the longer lead time while keeping demand estimates anchored to full-sample stats. This balances service (higher base stock for longer L) vs. holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 with on-hand=0, in-transit=328. Historical demand samples seed: [112,97,116,138,94]; concluded arrivals show a sustained lengthened lead-time regime (multiple observed lead_times ~2\u20133). There are overdue/lost shipment signals earlier but current pipeline is large (328) so prioritize using inferred average lead time to capture extended regime. Set L to 'calculate' so backend uses observed lead times average; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so forecast uses full-sample mean/std scaled by (1+L) inferred, balancing service level (profit>holding) with holding cost given large pipeline.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 19. On-hand=0, in-transit=386. Historical concluded lead times show a sustained lengthened regime (multiple 2\u20133 period leads across many orders). Use a recent average lead time to capture the extended regime while keeping demand forecasts based on all available demand samples (no clear demand mean shift). This balances service (longer L in mu_hat calculation) vs holding cost by letting the OR backend compute base stock using updated L and full-sample demand statistics.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed prolonged/lengthened lead-time regime: observed lead_times across concluded orders \u2248 mostly 2\u20133 periods (recent observed lead_times include many 2s and 3s; recent average \u22482.4\u20132.6). Treat lead time as extended until conclude messages normalize.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period=20. On-hand=0, in-transit=313. Historical concluded lead_times (from concludes) average \u22482.33 periods (multiple 2\u20133 observations, one 1). Promised L=2 but observed regime is lengthened; use L method='calculate' to let backend use observed lead-times. Demand sample mean=111.4 from provided past demands; use mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' so backend scales mean and volatility by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L) respectively, ensuring orders cover the review+lead horizon while accounting for observed longer lead times. Large in-transit stock reduces aggressive ordering despite extended lead times.

LLM Rationale:
Period 22. On-hand=0, in-transit=384. Historical demand samples seed = [112,97,116,138,94]; recent concluded arrivals show persistent lengthened lead times (mostly 2\u20133 periods). Several past orders experienced delayed or lost conclusions, so treat lead time as extended to avoid under-ordering. I set L explicitly to 2.5 to reflect the recent observed average (~2.4\u20132.6). I leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting the engine produce the capped base-stock considering the longer lead time and current pipeline. This balances higher safety stock for delayed arrivals versus holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Carry-over insight: Persistent lengthened lead-time regime: recent concluded orders exhibit mostly 2\u20133 period lead times; recent average \u22482.5 (use extended lead time until concludes normalize).

LLM Rationale:
Period_23: on-hand=0, in-transit=384, recent concludes show mostly 2\u20133 period lead times (many 2s and 3s); overdue/lost shipments have occurred historically. I set L explicitly to 2.5 to reflect the prolonged/lengthened lead-time regime (~2.4\u20132.5 recent average).

Historical concluded lead_times (from conclude messages) show mostly 2\u20133 periods (recent average \u22482.4\u20132.6) indicating a persistent lengthened lead-time regime and some lost/overdue shipments. I choose L via 'calculate' so backend uses the average of observed lead times from concluded orders (captures the 2\u20133 period regime). For demand sizing and risk, I use 'default' mu_hat and 'default' sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples \u2014 this balances service level uplift required by longer lead times while letting the OR engine apply its profit/holding tradeoff. This approach leverages concluded lead-time evidence and avoids over-committing inventory given many past lost/unconfirmed arrivals.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 27. On-hand=0, in-transit=384. History shows many concluded lead_times = mostly 2\u20133 periods (persistent extended regime). Use a recent-average lead time to reflect prolonged 2\u20133 period reality; use recent demand average (last 5 samples) to capture current demand level while keeping volatility estimate from full sample set. These settings protect service by increasing pipeline cover for the lengthened lead time while avoiding overstating variability.

Carry-over insight: Persistent lengthened lead-time regime: concluded lead_times across recent orders are mostly 2\u20133 periods, recent average \u22482.4\u20132.5; treat lead time as extended until conclude messages normalize.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28: on-hand=0, in-transit=384. Historical concludes show persistent lengthened lead-times (many concluded orders with lead_times mostly 2\u20133; recent average \u22482.4\u20132.6). Several earlier orders were overdue/lost before concluding, so treat lead time as extended to avoid under-ordering. Choose L explicit=2.5 to reflect the prolonged 2\u20133 period regime. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes demand and volatility from all samples scaled by (1+L); this keeps forecasting anchored to full history while the explicit L corrects for slower arrivals.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Period 29. On-hand=0, in-transit=384. Historical concluded lead_times mostly 2\u20133 periods (multiple concluded orders show 2\u20133), indicating a persistent lengthened lead-time regime and possible earlier lost shipments. Choice: set L via recent_N to capture the empirically observed extended lead time (use last 8 observed lead_time samples to reflect the ~2.4\u20132.6 average). Demand estimates use default methods (backend (1+L)\xd7mean of all provided samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) because available demand seed samples are limited and no strong recent demand regime shift is evident beyond typical variance. This balances service level (by increasing lead-time coverage) against holding costs while allowing the OR engine to apply its capped ordering logic given the longer effective lead time.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30. Recent concluded lead times are persistently lengthened (mostly 2\u20133 periods; recent average \u22482.4\u20132.6). Demand samples (historical) show moderate variability. On-hand=0, in-transit=384 (large pipeline but arrivals are delayed historically). To account for the extended lead-time regime I let the backend infer L from observed conclude messages (calculate). For demand across review+lead I use the backend defaults ((1+L)\xd7mean, sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR engine applies the correct scaling given the inferred L while respecting its capped ordering cap. This balances service (larger base-stock when L is larger) against holding cost given the sizable in-transit pipeline and observed delays.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period_31: on-hand=0, in-transit=384. Concluded lead-times in recent history are mostly 2\u20133 periods (recent average \u22482.4\u20132.6); treat current lead-time regime as lengthened. Set L via recent_N to capture the recent lead-time regime. For demand, recent periods show stable elevated weekly demand; use recent_N (last 5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR base-stock covers (1+L) periods of recent demand and accounts for recent volatility. This increases pipeline protection against overdue/lost shipments while controlling holding cost via the OR cap.

LLM Rationale:
Period_32: on-hand=0, in-transit=384. Historical concluded lead_times have been persistently lengthened (mostly 2\u20133); recent concluded sample set used to estimate lead time. I choose recent_N for L (N=8) to reflect the extended lead-time regime (~2.4\u20132.6) so the OR engine plans for a longer pipeline. mu_hat and sigma_hat use default (all-sample mean/std scaled by 1+L) so the backend computes demand across the review+lead period consistently with the inferred L. This balances higher service-level needs from extended lead times against holding cost given large in-transit stock.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_33: on-hand=0, in-transit=384. Historical conclude messages show a persistent lengthened lead-time regime with most observed lead_times = 2\u20133 (recent average \u22482.4\u20132.6) and many overdue shipments; use observed lead times rather than promised. Choose L.method = calculate to let backend use average of observed lead times. Demand history (samples [112,97,116,138,94]) shows no clear recent regime shift warranting a different demand forecast, so use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std respectively). This balances service level (accounting for extended lead time) against holding cost while the lead-time regime remains uncertain.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================

Period_34: on-hand=0, in-transit=385. History shows persistent lengthened lead-times (mostly 2\u20133 periods, recent average \u22482.4\u20132.5) and recent demand elevated/variable (last 5 demands: 110,111,154,90,87). Some earlier shipments were lost/overdue but recent concludes stabilized. To ensure the OR backend plans for the extended delivery regime and recent demand level, I set lead time explicitly to 2.5 (captures observed 2\u20133 period avg), and use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus forecast and volatility on the latest demand regime while limiting influence of older zeros/stockouts. This balances service (covering (1+L) periods of current demand) against holding cost given large in-transit pipeline.

LLM Rationale:
Period_35 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=408, historical demand samples mean=112.0 (from [112,97,116,138,94]). Many concluded orders show persistent extended lead times (mostly 2\u20133 periods, recent avg \u22482.4\u20132.6). Several earlier shipments were lost/very delayed, so I treat lead time as persistently lengthened. I set L explicit=2.5 to reflect the observed 2\u20133 period regime (balances risk of overdue shipments vs. holding cost). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this leverages full history while the explicit L corrects for extended delivery times. On-hand + in-transit (408) already provides substantial coverage; the backend cap will limit new orders if pipeline is sufficient.

Several earlier orders were lost/overdue then resumed with extended lead times. To protect service given prolonged lengthened regime, set L explicit=2.5. Use default demand sizing (mu_hat default) and default volatility (sigma_hat default) so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from historical demand samples; this balances higher pipeline coverage for longer lead time while avoiding overreaction to stockout-tainted recent zero sales.

To reflect the persistent lengthened lead-time regime while letting the OR backend compute demand quantities from full-sample stats, set L by averaging recent observed lead times (N=8). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples, leveraging all demand history while the longer lead time raises coverage. This balances service (higher base_stock due to longer L) against holding cost given large in-transit volume.

Carry-over insight: Persistent lengthened lead-time regime: recent concluded lead_times predominantly 2\u20133 periods; recent average \u22482.5 \u2014 treat lead time as extended until conclude messages normalize.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period: 40. On-hand=0, in-transit=384. Historical concluded arrivals show a persistent lengthened lead-time regime (many observed lead_times = 2\u20133, recent average \u22482.4\u20132.6) and several lost/overdue shipments earlier. To reflect observed lead-time drift I request the backend compute the empirical average lead time from concluded orders (method=calculate). For demand I use the default aggregation so backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean of all demand samples (robust to limited sample size) and likewise use default volatility scaling. These choices let the OR engine raise base_stock for the longer realized lead time while relying on historical mean/variance calculations the engine expects; this balances higher service level under extended lead times vs holding cost risk given substantial in-transit inventory.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 41: on-hand=0, in-transit=384. Historical concluded lead_times are persistently lengthened (mostly 2\u20133 periods, recent average \u22482.4\u20132.6). I set L by averaging the most recent 8 observed lead_times to capture the extended regime while remaining responsive. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes demand across (1+L) periods from full sample history; this balances service level against holding cost given extended lead times and large in-transit stock.

To reflect the persistent lengthened lead-time regime I set L using recent_N (last 8 observed lead_times) so the OR engine uses recent realized lead times. Demand stats (mu_hat, sigma_hat) use defaults so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting the engine balance service level vs holding cost given the adjusted L.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:

Current period 43: on-hand=0, in-transit=384. Historical concluded lead_times are persistently 2\u20133 periods (recent average \u22482.4\u20132.6). To account for extended/variable lead times and reduce stockouts, set L using a recent average of concluded lead times. Use default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and default volatility so the OR backend applies its regular aggregation and cap logic while using the more conservative recent L.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44. Recent demand samples show historically moderate volatility (past samples: [112,97,116,138,94]); current on-hand=0, in-transit=384 (large pipeline). History of concluded orders shows a persistent lengthened lead-time regime (many observed lead_times = 2\u20133, recent avg \u22482.4\u20132.6). Reconcile: sizable in-transit stock exists but arrivals have been delayed historically, so infer actual lead time from observed concludes rather than promised. Choices: L: calculate \u2014 use average of all observed lead times to reflect the prolonged 2\u20133 period regime and capture delayed/lost shipments; mu_hat: default \u2014 let backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) so demand forecast scales with inferred L; sigma_hat: default \u2014 let backend compute sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) to scale volatility with lead time. This approach lets the OR engine raise base stock proportional to the empirically longer lead time while relying on the existing demand samples and pipeline to avoid overordering given the large in-transit balance.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period_45: on-hand=0, in-transit=384. Historical demands [112,97,116,138,94] mean\u2248111.4. Concluded arrivals over many periods show persistent lengthened lead times mostly 2\u20133 (recent average \u22482.5). To protect service given overdue/lost shipments history, set lead time explicitly to 2.5 so the backend increases coverage; keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using the chosen L. This balances higher service level (avoid stockouts) against holding cost given large in-transit volume.

Set L explicit=2.5 to bridge promised vs observed delays. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples (stable demand history: [112,97,116,138,94]). This balances higher pipeline needs due to longer lead time while letting OR engine size safety stock from full-sample demand stats.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Observed concluded lead_times remain persistently lengthened (most recent concluded values 2\u20133 periods; recent average \u22482.5). Use explicit L=2.5 to reflect extended regime so backend orders cover the longer pipeline. Demand shows no clear recent structural shift vs. historical samples, so use a short recent-window mean to capture current demand level while keeping variance estimate from full sample set. This balances service (larger L raises mu_hat) against holding costs by avoiding an overly large explicit mean.

LLM Rationale:
Observed conclude history shows persistent lengthened lead-time regime with most concluded lead_times = 2\u20133 periods (recent average \u22482.5). In-transit is large (384) and on-hand=0; overdue/lost shipments have occurred historically. I therefore set lead time explicitly to 2.5 to reflect the extended regime so the OR engine computes (1+L) demand over the longer effective pipeline. I leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the backend uses all demand samples scaled by (1+L) and its capping rule to balance service level vs holding cost given the longer lead time and large pipeline.
