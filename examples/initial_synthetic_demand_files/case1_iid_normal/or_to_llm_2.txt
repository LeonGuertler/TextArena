Decision: follow OR's capped recommendation and order 137 units. Reasoning: we need to build pipeline to cover (L+1)=5 periods (~557 units), but the OR cap moderates single-period ordering spikes given demand variance and the 4-period lead time; placing 137 now increases pipeline without risking excessive holdings or reacting to possible lost shipments prematurely.

No concluded arrivals yet, so actual lead time is still unknown; cannot assume arrivals before promised 4 periods, and orders may be delayed or lost. Demand estimate from history: mean single-period \u2248111.4, 5-period (L+1) mean \u03bc\u0302\u2248557, \u03c3\u0302\u224839.4. OR recommended 139 (it caps a raw order \u2248296 down to \u2248140). Inventory math vs. demand: pipeline 278 << \u03bc\u0302 557, so current pipeline covers only ~2.5 of the next 5 periods. Goal: cover expected (L+1)-period demand while accounting for possible further delays. Action choice: place an order \u2248(\u03bc\u0302 \u2212 pipeline) \u2248 557\u2212278 \u2248 279 to bring pipeline+order \u2248557. I round slightly up to 296 to align with the uncapped base-stock shortfall (base_stock \u2212 pipeline \u2248 574\u2212278 \u2248 296) to rebuild safety stock given uncertain lead time. This deliberately overrides OR's cap because the pipeline is materially insufficient to meet the (L+1)-period expected demand; the extra units increase expected sales (profit $2/unit > holding $1/unit) and hedge against delayed/lost shipments. Risk: if all in-transit orders arrive on schedule and demand is lower, holding cost will increase, but expected reward from avoiding stockouts is higher under current uncertainty.
