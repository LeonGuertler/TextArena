Lead-time inference: past concluded arrivals show actual lead times have been variable (1\u20133 periods) with many delayed shipments; large unconfirmed pipeline has persisted through Period 44 and into Period 48, so these units are likely pending (delayed) rather than immediately lost.

Adjustment decision: follow OR and order 0 now to avoid overstock if the large in-transit batch arrives in coming periods; monitor Period 48 conclude for arrivals and reassess next period.

Rationale: keep exposure low because pipeline is large but partially untrusted (many delayed/lost arrivals); a small order covers a modest shortfall if some in-transit units are lost while limiting holding cost if the pipeline actually arrives. This balances the OR-derived base-stock signal (~8 units) against real-world pipeline uncertainty.",
