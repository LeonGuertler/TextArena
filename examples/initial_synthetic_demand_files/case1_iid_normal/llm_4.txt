Lead time & pipeline: history confirms variable actual lead time (1\u20133 periods) and prior concluded messages flagged delayed/lost shipments; in-transit should be treated as unreliable but currently large (In-transit=2052). Inventory assessment: On-hand=0, large in-transit could lead to heavy holding costs when arrivals occur. Decision logic: Do not place new orders so as to avoid overstock and holding-cost penalty given a very large in-transit pipeline and unclear arrival schedule; rely on in-transit to cover demand until arrivals are confirmed. Re-evaluate next period when arrive-conclude messages reveal actual arrivals and refine lead-time and demand estimate.",
