Note: Actual lead times in CSV may differ and will be inferred by LLM from arrivals.
Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
No arrivals or concludes yet; starting on-hand and in-transit are zero. No calendar/news signals provided. Use promised lead time (default) = 4 because no observed lead-time data to infer otherwise. Demand history (5 samples mean=111.4) is the best prior; set mu_hat and sigma_hat to default so OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std, ensuring pipeline covers (L+1)=5 periods of expected demand while letting OR balance service vs holding costs.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
No concluded arrivals yet for the Period 1 order (ordered=141, arrived=0) \u2014 in-transit matches that order so shipment is likely still en route (not yet past promised lead time). Demand history (5 samples) has mean 111.4 and moderate volatility (std \u224815.7). Use promised lead time (default) and default demand/volatility calculations so the OR backend computes base-stock using full-sample mean and std scaled by (1+L). This keeps coverage for the full review+lead horizon while avoiding speculative adjustments given no evidence of lost shipments or demand regime change.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3: no calendar news. Historical demand samples stable (mean=111.4, n=5). Concluded arrivals show orders placed in P1 and P2 have not yet arrived but are recorded as in-transit=278 (141+137) \u2014 consistent with promised lead time (4). No concluded late or lost shipments to justify changing lead time. Use default lead time so OR backend uses promised L=4. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (all-sample estimates scaled by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L)) because no clear demand regime shift and sample size small. Note: pipeline (278) is lower than default (1+L)*mean (~557), so the backend will likely order to refill to base stock; this balances service level (profit>holding cost) against holding costs.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_4 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=417 (orders from P1\u2013P3), no concluded arrivals yet \u2014 suggests actual lead time \u2265 promised or shipments still in flight; historical demands = [112,97,116,138,94], mean=111.4. I use promised lead time (default) because no concluded arrivals exist to compute actual lead time. I choose default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples, providing a stable baseline forecast while awaiting any concluded arrivals or evidence of lost shipments. This balances service level (covering L+1 periods) against holding cost given moderate demand variability.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Context: Period_5. On-hand=0, in-transit=555. Historical demands: [112,97,116,138,94] (mean=111.4, recent no clear demand shift). Concluded history shows no arrivals for orders placed in Periods 1-4 (arrived=0 each conclude), so shipments are overdue but we have no concluded arrivals to revise lead time reliably. Decision: keep L at promised lead time (default) because actual lead time cannot be inferred from concluded messages yet. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, ensuring the base-stock covers the review+lead period demand while the capped-order rule limits excess ordering given large in-transit inventory. This balances service level versus holding cost given uncertain arrivals and substantial pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Possible lost/very-delayed shipments: orders placed in Periods 1-4 (shown in concludes) all have arrived=0; monitor for continued non-conclusion as evidence of lost shipments.

=== Period 5 Summary ===

Daily Profit: $102.00, Daily Holding Cost: $90.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $12.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6: One concluded arrival shows order placed in Period 1 arrived with lead_time=4, confirming at least one on-time 4-period lead time. Orders placed in Periods 2-4 remain un-concluded (possible delays/loss) but large in-transit (423) + on-hand 90 provide cover. Demand history (samples = [112,97,116,138,94]) shows no clear recent demand regime shift. To be conservative and align with confirmed observations, set L via calculated average of observed lead times (captures confirmed 4). Use default demand and volatility aggregation ((1+L)\xd7mean, sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR backend applies its standard base-stock computation and cap given the promised lead time and historical variability. This balances service level (profit>holding) while avoiding aggressive forecast tweaks given unresolved shipments.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead_time = 4 periods (Period 1 order arrived in Period 5 with lead_time=4); orders from Periods 2-4 still un-concluded\u2014monitor for lost shipments.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-26.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7: recent concludes confirm actual lead_time = 4 (Period1 arrived in P5 with lead_time=4; Period2 arrived in P6 with lead_time=4). On-hand=160, in-transit=315 (includes orders placed in P3\u2013P6). Historical demand samples = [112,97,116,138,94], mean=111.4. I set L=calculate to lock in observed lead time average from concluded arrivals. I choose mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples\u2014this leverages full-sample demand estimates while matching confirmed lead time, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=2 and holding=1.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead_time = 4 periods (evidence: Period1 order arrived in Period5, Period2 order arrived in Period6 with lead_time=4). Orders from Periods 3\u20134 remain in-transit; monitor for loss if they fail to conclude by expected arrival.

Daily Reward (R_t): $10.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8: confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (evidence: Period1->arrived in P5, Period2->P6, Period3->P7 all with lead_time=4). Current inventory: on-hand=196, in-transit=227. Several earlier orders (Periods 4 and later) remain in-transit but recent conclues show consistent 4-period arrivals, so use observed lead-time. Demand history (samples) mean = 111.4; with L=4 the review+lead horizon =5 periods. To balance service level vs holding cost (profit=2, holding=1 \u2192 q=2/(2+1)=0.666), use default demand estimates based on full-sample statistics so the OR backend computes base-stock from the historical mean/variance over the 5-period horizon. This keeps replenishment sized to expected 5-period demand while relying on confirmed lead time to avoid under-ordering given in-transit stock.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
History shows consistent concluded lead_time=4 (Period1\u21925, Period2\u21926, Period3\u21927, Period4\u21928). On-hand=242 and in-transit=192 (sufficient short-term cover). I use calculate for L to reflect observed actual lead time=4, and default for mu_hat/sigma_hat so the OR backend uses (1+L)\xd7historical mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std from the five demand samples (captures existing demand level/volatility). This keeps service high given confirmed long lead time while letting the OR engine balance profit vs holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $49.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_10: recent concludes show consistent actual lead_time=4 (Period1\u21925, P2\u21926, P3\u21927, P4\u21928, P5\u21929). On-hand=151, in-transit=271 \u2192 total supply=422 units. Recent demand history (Periods1\u20139) centers ~100 units/period; provided seed samples also similar. Given confirmed stable lead time and no strong evidence of a demand regime shift, use lead-time estimate computed from observed concludes and default demand/volatility aggregation to let the OR engine apply its base-stock math. This balances service (use accurate L=4) with holding cost by not inflating demand forecast beyond historical mean.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed stable actual lead_time = 4 periods (evidence: orders placed on Periods 1\u20135 arrived on Periods 5\u20139 with lead_time=4); previous feared lost shipments resolved.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11. Demand history (samples) = [112,97,116,138,94], mean=111.4. Actual lead time has been consistently 4 periods (confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5\u201310), so use promised/default lead time. Current on-hand=101, in-transit=341 => total pipeline=442 units, which is below the default target ((1+L)\xd7mean = 5\xd7111.4 = 557), so replenishment is appropriate. I choose default methods so the OR backend uses its standard (1+L)-scaled mean and sqrt(1+L)-scaled std estimates, matching the stable lead-time regime and balancing service level vs. holding cost.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12: on-hand=30, in-transit=362. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead_time = 4 periods (orders arriving with W=4). To reflect observed lead time I choose L by averaging observed lead times. Demand shows no abrupt, sustained regime shift requiring manual reweighting, so use backend defaults for mu_hat and sigma_hat so base-stock is computed from full sample mean/std scaled by (1+L). This balances service (use observed L) vs holding cost by letting OR engine compute safety stock from full-history demand statistics.

On-hand=14, in-transit=389 \u2014 ample pipeline but observe low on-hand now. Demand history (samples [112,97,116,138,94]) has mean \u2248111.4 and moderate variability. I use default lead time (promised L=4 consistent with concluded evidence) and default demand statistics so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std, which balances service level (uses full sample mean/variance) against holding cost given current high pipeline.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date: Period_14. Recent concludes confirm stable actual lead_time = 4 periods (orders from Periods 1\u20139 arrived with lead_time=4). On-hand=0, in-transit=425 which is short of coverage for (L+1)=5 periods given historical mean demand (~111.4/unit). I therefore use the promised/default lead time and default demand/volatility calculations so the OR backend uses (1+L)\xd7historic mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7historic std; this aligns with confirmed lead time and anchors forecasts to the available historical samples while letting the OR engine compute the base-stock and cap.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed stable actual lead_time = 4 periods (evidence: orders placed on Periods 1\u20139 arrived on Periods 5\u201313 with lead_time=4).

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period_15: confirmed stable actual lead_time = 4 periods from history (orders placed Periods 1\u201310 consistently arrived with lead_time=4). Current on-hand=0, in-transit=428 units. Historical sample mean demand=111.4 (samples: [112,97,116,138,94]). Using promised/default lead time keeps L=4 to match observed stability. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample; this balances service level (covering 5 periods demand) against holding cost given in-transit is sizable but currently short of the 5-period expected demand (5\xd7111.4=557), so backend will likely order to top up pipeline.

Current period 16. History shows stable actual lead_time = 4 periods (consistent concludes: orders placed in Periods 1\u201311 arrived with lead_time=4). On-hand=0, in-transit=462 which covers multiple upcoming periods. Demand history (samples [112,97,116,138,94]) has no clear recent regime shift. Use default lead time (promised 4) and default demand/volatility computations so the OR backend produces the standard base-stock adjusted for L=4; this balances service level (profit>holding) against holding cost given no new signal.

Daily Reward (R_t): $152.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18: demand history shows moderate, stable demand (samples mean=111.4) and arrivals through Period 17 confirm actual lead_time=4. On-hand=66, in-transit=355 => ample pipeline but demand continues. Use promised lead time (default) since actual lead time has been stable at 4 and OR engine expects promised L. Use default demand/volatility calculations so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given profitable margin ($2 vs $1).

Carry-over insight: Confirmed stable actual lead_time = 4 periods (evidence: concluded arrivals through Period 17 show orders arriving with lead_time=4).

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19. Inventory: on-hand=92, in-transit=364. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead_time=4 periods through Period 18. Demand samples (seed) = [112,97,116,138,94]. I choose default for L so backend uses promised lead time (4) which matches observed regime; default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This keeps the OR engine's base-stock anchored to the full-sample demand mean/volatility and balances the $2 profit vs $1 holding cost tradeoff under the confirmed LT=4.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Context: Period 20. On-hand=76, in-transit=328. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4 (orders placed in Periods 1\u201315 concluded with W=4); demand samples = [112,97,116,138,94] (mean=111.4). No evidence of lost shipments in recent history\u2014lead time appears stable. Choice: set L via calculate to use observed lead-time average (captures confirmed L=4). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample; this leverages the small stable sample and keeps estimates robust without overfitting to short-term noise. This balances service (profit $2 vs holding $1 implies moderate safety stock) while avoiding excessive holding given current healthy pipeline.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_21: demand history and conclude messages show a stable actual lead time = 4 periods (consistent arrivals through Period 20). On-hand = 51, in-transit = 380 \u2014 ample pipeline covering multiple (L+1) periods of demand. No new evidence of lost shipments or demand regime shift; recent demand variability is already captured in historical samples. Therefore use default methods (promised L and aggregate demand statistics) so the OR backend applies its calibrated base-stock policy without overreacting to noise. This balances service (high pipeline + base-stock) against holding cost.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:

Current context: Period 23. Historical conclues show stable actual lead_time = 4 periods (consistent arrivals with lead_time=4 through Period 22). On-hand=57, in-transit=388 => pipeline coverage = 445 units. Using the 5-sample demand history (mean \u2248111.4) implies (1+L)=5 period demand \u2248557 units, so current pipeline+on-hand is ~112 units short of covering (L+1) periods at the historical mean. To balance service level vs holding cost I keep L at the promised/stable value and use default demand/volatility calculations so the OR backend computes base-stock from full-sample mean and std; this avoids overfitting to short-term noise while letting the OR engine cap orders appropriately.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24: on-hand=0, in-transit=397. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead_time = 4 periods (orders placed on Periods 1\u201319 concluded with lead_time=4), so use promised/default lead time. Demand history sample (provided) has mean = (112+97+116+138+94)/5 = 111.4; with L=4, use default aggregate formulas so OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples. This balances service level (use full historical mean over the review+lead horizon) against holding cost given moderate profit/holding ratio.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained actual lead_time = 4 periods (evidence: concluded arrivals for orders placed on Periods 1\u201319 all report lead_time=4); no lost shipments detected in recent history.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_26: confirmed stable actual lead_time = 4 periods in recent history; demand samples (112,97,116,138,94) have mean \u2248111.4. Current on-hand 39 + in-transit 401 >> typical demand, so no aggressive safety-upgrade needed. No evidence of new lead-time or demand regime shifts. Use default promised-lead-time policy so OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7historical mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std, keeping service high while letting pipeline absorb variability and avoiding extra holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Period 27: history shows a stable actual lead_time = 4 periods (concluded arrivals consistently report lead_time=4 through Period 26). Recent demand samples (112,97,116,138,94) have mean ~111.4. Current on-hand 42 + in-transit 393 = 435 units \u2014 ample coverage vs. typical demand.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28. Historical concludes show a stable actual lead_time = 4 periods (consistent arrivals with lead_time=4 through Period 27). On-hand=8, in-transit=403 -> large pipeline covering many future periods. Demand history samples = [112,97,116,138,94]; no recent changepoint in demand detected. I choose default lead time (use promised 4) and default mu_hat/sigma_hat so the OR backend uses (1+L)\xd7sample mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7sample std \u2014 this leverages the stable lead-time regime and observed demand without overreacting to short-term noise, balancing service level (profit>holding cost) against holding cost given large in-transit inventory.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
History shows stable actual lead_time=4 (concluded arrivals consistent through Period 28). On-hand=32, in-transit=385 \u2014 pipeline already covers multiple periods. Use default lead time to match promised/observed 4. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample [112,97,116,138,94], preserving statistical grounding while the large pipeline maintains service level and avoids unnecessary extra holding.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained actual lead_time = 4 periods (evidence: concluded arrivals through Period 28 show orders arriving with lead_time=4).

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_30: confirmed stable actual lead_time = 4 periods in concluded history. On-hand=17, in-transit=400 (ample pipeline). Use promised/default lead time to match observed stability. Demand history (samples mean=111.4) and no recent regime shift -> use default (1+L)\xd7mean and default volatility to let OR backend compute base_stock consistent with long-run demand and observed lead time. This keeps service high while avoiding unnecessary explicit increases to forecast; current large pipeline plus L=4 covers several periods of demand.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31: recent concludes show stable actual lead_time = 4 periods. On-hand=0, in-transit=425 => substantial pipeline coverage. Demand history (seed samples) shows mean demand ~111; profit $2, holding $1 implies service-level weighting but no new demand regime or lead-time change detected. Use default (promised) lead time and default demand/volatility calculations so OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7sample mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std, letting capped order rule control order size given large in-transit inventory. This avoids over-ordering while maintaining service given confirmed L=4 and heavy pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $178.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32: on-hand=0, in-transit=440. Historical concludes through Period 31 consistently show actual lead_time=4. Pipeline (440) is below (1+L)\xd7mean demand (~557), so we should use the stable promised lead time and default demand estimates to prompt replenishment. Choose L=default to reflect the stable 4-period lead time; mu_hat and sigma_hat default to let OR engine compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the sample history.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained actual lead_time = 4 periods through Period 31 (evidence: concluded arrivals for recent orders report lead_time=4).

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33. Concluded history through Period 32 consistently shows actual lead_time = 4 periods; no evidence of lost shipments. Recent demand average from seed samples is ~111.4 units/period, so with review+lead horizon (1+L)=5 the default aggregation is appropriate. Current on-hand=25 and in-transit=423 \u2014 pipeline is large relative to single-period demand, so use baseline/default estimates to let OR backend compute base-stock and cap using its statistical model. Defaults balance service level (stable L=4) against holding cost without overreacting to short-term inventory fluctuations.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_34: demand context based on provided past samples (mean=111.4). Confirmed stable actual lead_time=4 in history; use promised/default lead time. Current inventory: on-hand=48, in-transit=401 \u2014 ample pipeline cover for several periods. Using default methods keeps OR backend anchored to historical mean ((1+L)*mean \u2248 5*111.4) and sqrt scaling for volatility while trusting stable observed L=4; this balances service level (high pipeline) against holding costs.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date Period_35. Historical concludes through Period_34 consistently show orders arriving with lead_time=4; on-hand=79 and in-transit=375 provide ample coverage. Use default lead time (promised=4) since actual lead_time is stable at 4. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the historical demand samples; this balances service level (profit $2 vs holding $1) automatically via base-stock formula. On-hand + in-transit comfortably covers (1+L) periods of expected demand, avoiding urgent sizing changes.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained actual lead_time = 4 periods through Period 34 (evidence: concluded arrivals through Period 34 report lead_time=4).

On-hand=68, in-transit=348 \u2192 pipeline coverage is ample for (L+1) periods.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 38. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead_time = 4 periods (stable across many concluded orders). On-hand=29, in-transit=410; pipeline appears healthy with no recent lost shipments. I use the promised/default lead time (L=4) because concluded history confirms it. For demand forecast I use the default aggregated view: mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) which captures long-run average demand (samples mean=111.4 \u2192 mu_hat=557). For volatility I use the default multiplicative scaling: sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) to reflect uncertainty over the multi-period review+lead horizon. These defaults align with stable lead time and moderate demand variability, balancing service level (via base-stock) against holding cost given profit= $2 and holding=$1.

Past sample mean = 111.4 (samples: [112,97,116,138,94]). No evidence of lost shipments or demand regime shift; pipeline is large but below (1+L)*mean so OR should replenish. Use default methods so backend applies its historical stats with promised lead time and stable demand assumptions.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained actual lead_time = 4 periods through Period_38 (evidence: concluded arrivals in Periods up to 38 report lead_time=4).

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40: confirmed stable actual lead_time = 4 periods in recent history; on-hand=33, in-transit=420 which (with L=4) gives ample pipeline. Historical demand samples (112,97,116,138,94) show mean ~111.4. Use promised/default lead time to match observed stability and let OR backend compute base-stock from full-sample demand stats. Default mu_hat and sigma_hat keep long-run demand signal (no detected demand regime shift) while pipeline sufficiency limits urgent ordering and holding cost exposure.

Historical demand samples: [112,97,116,138,94], mean=111.4.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_42: on-hand=46, in-transit=366. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead_time=4 (orders placed arrive after 4 periods) so no change to promised L. Demand history (seed) mean=111.4 across samples [112,97,116,138,94]. To let OR backend compute base-stock and caps with correct scaling over the review+lead horizon, use default lead time (promised 4) and default demand scaling: mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples). This preserves the stable lead-time regime and leverages the full sample set to balance service level (profit/holding tradeoff) versus inventory cost given current healthy pipeline (366 units).

Daily Reward (R_t): $200.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_43: demand history shows no recent changepoint; concluded arrivals through Period_42 consistently report lead_time=4 and no lost shipments. Current inventory: on-hand=28, in-transit=391, so ample pipeline. I choose L='default' (use promised lead time=4) because observed lead time is stable at 4. I choose mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' to let the OR engine compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the provided demand samples\u2014this balances service level (using complete history) against holding cost given large in-transit volume.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained actual lead_time = 4 periods through Period_42 (evidence: concluded arrivals for orders placed on recent periods all report lead_time=4); no recent lost shipments detected.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44. Recent concluded history consistently shows actual lead_time = 4 periods through Period 43. Current inventory: on-hand=21, in-transit=430 \u2014 ample pipeline but on-hand low so pipeline covers future demand. No calendar/news signals requiring deviation. I therefore use default lead time (promised 4) and default demand estimates so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all historical samples; this leverages the full demand history and the confirmed stable LT=4, balancing service level (profit>holding cost) against holding cost given large pipeline.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
On-hand=0, in-transit=435. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead_time=4; promised lead time = 4 is confirmed. With profit=2 and holding=1, backend base-stock tradeoff is appropriate using its default demand estimates. I choose default lead time to align with observed stable L=4 and use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full demand history. This ensures orders target (L+1)-period coverage while letting the OR engine apply the correct service-level caps given profit/holding costs.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46. Demand history shows stable patterns and concluded arrivals consistently report actual lead_time = 4 periods. On-hand=15, in-transit=414 (large pipeline). Profit=$2, Holding=$1. Given stable LT=4 and ample pipeline, use default lead-time and default demand estimates so OR backend computes base_stock from full-sample mean/variance. This avoids overreacting to short-term demand noise while preserving service with existing in-transit stock.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained actual lead_time = 4 periods through Period_45 (evidence: concluded arrivals for orders placed on recent periods continue to report lead_time=4; no recent lost shipments detected).

Daily Reward (R_t): $179.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47: recent concluded history through Period 46 consistently shows actual lead_time = 4 (orders arriving with lead_time=4). On-hand = 31, in-transit = 396 \u2014 pipeline + on-hand comfortably covers multiple periods of demand. Historical demand samples provided (seed) show mean demand ~113.4; no evidence of a demand regime change or lost shipments. Therefore use default settings so OR backend uses promised L=4 and the full-sample demand moments ((1+L)\xd7mean, sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This keeps the policy aligned with observed stable lead time and balances service level vs holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 48. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead_time = 4 periods through Period 47. Demand samples (seed) = [112,97,116,138,94], mean=111.4. On-hand=24, in-transit=386 \u2192 ample pipeline cover. I therefore keep L at the promised/default (4) and use default demand/volatility calculations so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this leverages the stable lead-time signal and the baseline demand samples while avoiding overreaction to short-term variability.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained actual lead_time = 4 periods through Period_47 (evidence: concluded arrivals for orders placed on recent periods continue to report lead_time=4, most recently the arrival shown in Period_47).

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 49 (reading Period_48 conclude). Recent concluded arrivals show a stable actual lead_time = 4 periods for many cycles. On-hand=0, in-transit=429 units (these will arrive over coming periods per L=4 pattern). Historical sample seed (small provided sample) shows moderate demand mean/variance; no calendar event or regime shift observed. I therefore use default lead time (promised L=4, consistent with concluded evidence) and default demand/volatility calculations so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This keeps the base-stock anchored to long-run demand while the large in-transit pipeline already provides coverage for multiple periods, avoiding unnecessary extra ordering and high holding cost.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_50: no special calendar events. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead_time = 4 (orders placed on Period t arriving on Period t+4 through Period_49), so I trust promised lead time. On-hand = 0, in-transit = 437 (covers upcoming demand during lead+review). Use default statistical estimates based on available demand samples to let the OR engine compute base_stock and cap; this balances service level (profitable units) versus holding cost given stable lead time and no detected regime shift.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained actual lead_time = 4 periods through Period_49 (evidence: concluded arrivals for orders placed on recent periods continue to report lead_time=4).
