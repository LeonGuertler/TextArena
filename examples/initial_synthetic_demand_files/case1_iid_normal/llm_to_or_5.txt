Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical demand samples for chips(Regular) = [112,97,116,138,94] (mean ~111.4). No concluded arrivals or evidence of lead-time shifts or demand regime change. Use promised lead time (default) to ensure orders cover review+lead horizon; use default demand/volatility estimates (all samples) so OR backend builds base_stock = (1+L)*mean \xb1 safety.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_2 decision. Recent demand history (5 samples: 112,97,116,138,94) shows mean ~111; no clear changepoint. On-hand=0, in-transit=141 (ordered in P1) but Period_1 conclude shows arrived=0 for that order \u2014 consistent with promised lead time=2 (arrival should show in Period_3 conclude) so do not treat as lost yet. Use promised lead time to keep OR engine assumptions aligned and avoid overcompensating for potentially delayed but not-lost shipment. Set L=default so backend uses promised L=2. Use mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from full sample set; this leverages all available demand history and keeps safety stock/calculation consistent with the promised lead time while we wait for arrival confirmation.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3: on-hand=0, in-transit=278 (orders from P1=141, P2=137) but no arrivals recorded in Period 1 or 2 concludes. Promised lead time=2; actual lead time not yet confirmed (no concluded arrivals). To avoid overreacting to potentially delayed or lost shipments, keep L at the promised default and use default demand estimates seeded by the full historical sample (mean demand \u2248111.4). Using default mu_hat and sigma_hat provides the OR engine with the standard (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std estimates while the large in-transit buffer will limit new orders\u2014this balances service level vs holding cost until arrival behavior is observed.

Carry-over insight: In-transit=278 (P1+P2 orders) with arrived=0 in concludes \u2192 possible delayed or lost shipments; monitor for arrivals in upcoming concludes before changing lead-time assumption.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_4 start. Recent concludes (Periods 1-3) show ordered shipments but arrived=0 each period => likely prolonged delays or lost shipments versus promised L=2. Demand history (samples=[112,97,116,138,94], mean=111.4) shows stable average; no clear demand regime shift. To be conservative and ensure pipeline covers upcoming demand while overdue shipments clear, I explicitly increase lead time to 3 periods. mu_hat and sigma_hat use defaults so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, preserving historical demand signal while the longer L raises safety stock for delayed arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Observed delayed/lost shipments: Periods 1-3 orders concluded with arrived=0 (in-transit persists). Treat lead-time regime as extended until an arrival conclude confirms otherwise.

Daily Profit: $248.00, Daily Holding Cost: $154.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $94.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_5: on-hand=154, in-transit=168. Recent concludes show arrivals in Period_4 of orders from P1 (lead_time=3) and P2 (lead_time=2) after multiple periods of zero arrivals \u2014 evidence lead time has recently stretched beyond the promised 2. I choose L.method="calculate" so the backend uses the observed lead-time average (captures 3 and 2). Demand estimates use mu_hat.method="default" and sigma_hat.method="default" so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, preserving full-sample stability while the calculated L adjusts the replenishment horizon to cover the extended lead time and mitigate stockout risk without overcommitting inventory.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime extended: observed lead_times = 3 (order P1) and 2 (order P2) confirmed in Period_4 conclude; average lead_time > promised 2 \u2014 treat lead time as extended until more concludes confirm reversion.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-1.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_6 start: on-hand=103, in-transit=299. Recent concludes show orders from P1 and P2 arrived in Period_4 with lead_times 3 and 2 respectively (average 2.5) and P5 order still outstanding (arrived=0). This confirms an extended lead-time regime vs promised 2. I choose L=recent_N (N=2) to reflect the most recent observed lead-times (2 and 3). For demand sizing and variability I use default estimators so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample set, keeping forecasts robust given limited data and avoiding overreaction to a single low demand period. These settings raise the pipeline coverage to account for longer delivery times while letting the OR engine balance service level vs holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime extended: observed lead_times = 3 (order P1) and 2 (order P2) confirmed in Period_4 conclude; recent average lead_time = 2.5 \u2014 treat lead time as extended until further concludes confirm reversion.

Daily Reward (R_t): $44.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 decision: on-hand=90, in-transit=279. Historical demand samples = [112,97,116,138,94] (mean=111.4). Concluded arrivals show observed lead_times = [3,2,3] (avg\u22482.67) \u2014 lead-time regime remains extended vs. promised 2. Use L='calculate' to let backend average observed lead times. Use mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' so forecasts scale with (1+L) and full-sample mean/std; this balances service against holding cost given prolonged in-transit inventory and confirmed longer lead times.

Daily Reward (R_t): $88.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_8: on-hand=118, in-transit=202. Historical concludes show observed lead_times = 3 (P1), 2 (P2), 3 (P3) \u2192 recent average ~2.67, so treat lead time as extended. Use recent_N for L to capture this new lead-time regime (N=3). Demand shows variability vs earlier baseline; use recent_N for mu_hat (N=5) to weight most recent demand samples rather than full-history default. Use default sigma_hat to let OR compute volatility scaled by (1+L). These choices aim to raise base-stock to cover the longer observed lead time while relying on backend volatility calc to balance service level vs holding cost. 

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime extended: observed lead_times = 3 (P1), 2 (P2), 3 (P3); recent average lead_time = 2.6667 \u2014 treat lead time as extended until future conclude messages show reversion.

Daily Reward (R_t): $124.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9: on-hand=60, in-transit=210. Concluded lead times from history = [3,2,3,2,2] (Periods 1,2,3,5,6 arrivals). Recent average lead time \u2248 2.4, which exceeds promised 2 \u2014 treat lead time as extended. Demand history mean=111.4 (samples: [112,97,116,138,94]); no clear recent demand regime shift. Choose L by averaging the 5 most recent observed lead times to capture current extended regime. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to scale demand by (1+L) using recent evidence; keep sigma_hat default to reflect full-sample volatility scaled by (1+L). These parameters bias orders upward to cover the longer observed pipeline while letting the OR backend trade service level vs holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime extended: observed lead_times = 3,2,3,2,2 (Periods 1-6 arrivals); recent average lead_time = 2.4 \u2014 continue treating lead time as extended until future concludes show reversion.

Daily Reward (R_t): $120.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10: on-hand=0, in-transit=257, recent demand history stable (samples [112,97,116,138,94], mean=111.4). Multiple conclude messages show extended lead-times (observed lead_times = [3,2,3,2,2] for orders P1\u2013P6) with recent average \u22482.4 and recent lost/delayed arrivals earlier. To account for the observed longer lead time I set L using recent observed lead times (recent_N=5). For demand forecast and volatility I use defaults ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over all samples) so the OR engine's base-stock calculation scales demand and uncertainty for the longer inferred lead time while keeping calculations anchored to the full demand history. This approach hedges service level upward to cover delayed arrivals without overreacting to short-term noise.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime extended: observed lead_times = [3,2,3,2,2] (orders P1\u2013P6 concluded); recent average lead_time = 2.4 \u2014 continue treating lead time as extended until future conclude messages show reversion.

Daily Reward (R_t): $141.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11: on-hand=17, in-transit=262, recent demand samples = [112,97,116,138,94]. Multiple conclude messages show elevated/variable lead times (observed sequence of concluded lead_times \u2248 [3,2,3,2,2,3,2], recent average \u22482.4). I therefore set lead time based on recent observed regime (recent_N=5) to capture the current extended lead-time environment. For demand I use the default aggregation ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and default volatility to let the OR engine compute base-stock using all historical demand data while accounting for the longer lead time. This balances service (by increasing coverage for the extended lead time) against holding cost by not overreacting to short-term demand noise.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12. On-hand=0, in-transit=356; historical concludes show repeated delayed arrivals with recent observed lead_times = [3,2,3,2,2] (avg \u22482.4). Treat lead time as extended and use recent_N averaging of last 5 observed lead times to capture current regime. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean_all and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std_all, providing safety stock scaled to the inferred longer lead time while relying on full-sample demand stats.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_13: on-hand=0, in-transit=332. Recent conclude history shows repeated delayed arrivals with observed lead_times = [3,2,3,2,2,3,2,3], avg=2.5 -> lead time regime extended above promised 2. I set L via recent_N (N=8) to reflect the recent observed lead-time average. Demand samples provided (five-sample history) have mean \u2248111.4; I leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using the chosen L, letting the optimizer trade service vs holding cost given the extended lead time and current large in-transit position.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime extended: observed lead_times [3,2,3,2,2,3,2,3], recent average=2.5; continue treating lead time > promised until concludes show reversion.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 14: on-hand=0, in-transit=385. Historical concluded lead_times = [3,2,3,2,2,3,2,3] (orders P1\u2013P8), recent average \u22482.5 and many delayed/zero-arrival events earlier\u2014evidence of an extended lead-time regime. I set L using recent_N (N=8) to capture the sustained longer lead time. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples; scaling by (1+L) increases target pipeline to cover L+1 periods of demand and the elevated safety stock implied by sigma_hat helps mitigate lost/delayed shipments while balancing holding cost via the backend's q tradeoff.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime extended: observed lead_times [3,2,3,2,2,3,2,3] (orders P1\u2013P8), recent average \u22482.5; continue treating actual lead time > promised until concludes show reversion.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15: on-hand=0, in-transit=375. Historical concludes show repeated delayed arrivals with observed lead_times = [3,2,3,2,2,3,2,3] (avg \u22482.5) indicating a sustained extended lead-time regime vs promised 2. I set L=calculate so the backend uses the average observed lead time from concludes. I keep mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the backend scales forecast and uncertainty by (1+L) using all demand samples (stable small-sample history). This raises the base-stock to cover the longer effective pipeline while relying on backend cap to limit excessive orders given holding cost.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_16: on-hand=0, in-transit=391. Historical concludes show a persistent extended lead-time regime (multiple concluded lead_times averaging \u22482.4\u20132.5). Many past orders eventually arrived but with lead_time > promised 2, and some periods had zero arrivals before later concludes. To reflect observed actual lead time while letting backend compute demand-over-review+lead, set L to 'calculate' (use average of observed lead times). Use default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples \u2014 this balances service vs holding cost given the longer empirical lead time and large in-transit pipeline. Monitor upcoming concludes for reversion before switching to a shorter L.

LLM Rationale:
Period_17: on-hand=0, in-transit=392, recent concludes show persistent delayed arrivals with observed lead_times = [3,2,3,2,2,3,2,3] (avg 2.5). Evidence supports treating actual lead time > promised. Set L via 'calculate' to let backend use observed average lead time. Use default demand aggregation ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and default volatility to let OR engine compute base-stock and cap using full-sample mean/stdev while accounting for longer lead time; this balances service (larger base stock due to longer L) against holding cost given large pipeline but uncertain arrivals.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_18 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=376. Historical concludes show repeated delayed arrivals with observed lead_times clustered around 2\u20133 periods; recent average ~2.5. To protect service while shipments remain erratic, I set lead-time estimate using recent observed lead_times (recent_N=8) rather than the promised 2. Use default demand and volatility aggregation ((1+L)\xd7mean, sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR backend inflates order targets automatically for the longer review+lead period and balances profit vs holding cost via its base-stock formula.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime remains extended: observed lead_times through Period_17 average \u22482.5 (multiple concluded orders showing 2\u20133 periods); continue treating actual lead time > promised until concludes show reversal.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19: on-hand=0, in-transit=376. Historical concluded arrivals show repeated delays with observed lead_times = [3,2,3,2,2,3,2,3,...] (recent average \u22482.5). I treat actual lead time as extended and set L explicitly to 2.5. I leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples \u2014 this ensures order targets cover the review+lead window (L+1 periods) while the backend's cap limits order size to control holding cost given high in-transit volume.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime extended: recent concluded lead_times average \u22482.5 (multiple orders with 2\u20133 periods, evidence across concluded orders P1\u2013P8+); continue treating actual L>promised until concludes show reversion.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20: on-hand=0, in-transit=375. Historical concluded lead_times show repeated 2\u20133 period deliveries (recent average \u22482.5) indicating an extended lead-time regime vs promised 2. To reflect actual delivery behavior I let L be calculated from observed concludes (method='calculate') so the backend uses the empirical average lead time. Demand history (samples [112,97,116,138,94]) is stable enough to use full-sample defaults for mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR engine balances service level and holding cost without overfitting short-term noise. This approach is conservative to cover the extended pipeline while avoiding aggressive extra safety stock absent stronger demand shifts.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21: on-hand=0, in-transit=384; history shows many concluded orders with lead_times mostly 2\u20133 (recent average \u22482.5) indicating an extended lead-time regime and intermittent lost/delayed shipments. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the observed average lead time from concluded orders (captures extension vs promised 2). I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as 'default' so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean(demand) and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std(demand) using all samples, which balances service level (larger base stock when L>promised) against holding cost and accounts for the higher effective demand-review+lead period. This conservative approach avoids premature manual forecast shifts while the conclude stream continues to confirm the extended lead time.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:

Historical concluded orders show repeatedly extended lead times (multiple concluded lead_times = 2\u20133, recent average \u22482.5) and intermittent lost/delayed shipments. To let the OR engine internally compute the best conservative lead-time estimate from concluded history, I select L='calculate' so backend averages observed lead times. For demand sizing and volatility I use the defaults so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, allowing the model to scale safety stock with the inferred longer lead time while keeping parameter updates simple given noisy arrivals.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23: on-hand=0, in-transit=384. Historical concluded lead_times show a persistent extended regime (mix of 2\u20133 periods) with recent average \u22482.5; several earlier promised arrivals were delayed or lost then later concluded, so assume extended lead time to avoid underordering. Use explicit L=2.5 to capture the observed extended lead-time regime. For demand forecasting use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all demand samples, which balances service level vs holding cost given the longer lead time and the backend's capped-order logic.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime remains extended: concluded lead_times through Period_22 average \u22482.5 (consistent 2\u20133 period arrivals); continue treating actual L>promised until concludes show reversion.

Given persistent delayed arrivals and large pipeline, set L explicitly to 2.5 to reflect the extended lead-time regime. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes demand across review+lead using all samples scaled by (1+L) and volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L); this balances higher required pipeline against holding cost while letting backend apply its service-level cap.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime remains extended: concluded lead_times repeatedly 2\u20133 periods with recent average \u22482.5 (evidence across multiple concluded orders P1\u2013P16+); treat actual L\u22482.5 until concludes show reversion.

To reflect persistent extended lead time I let backend compute average observed lead time (calculate).

Continue treating lead time as > promised to avoid under-ordering. Use L='calculate' so backend infers average observed lead time from concluded history (captures ~2.5). Demand history sample set (provided) is small and no clear recent demand regime shift; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so backend computes review+lead demand and volatility consistent with chosen L. This balances service (higher L\u2192larger mu_hat safety stock) against holding cost given profit=2, holding=1.

Period 31: on-hand=0, in-transit=384. Historical concluded lead_times repeatedly 2\u20133 periods with recent average \u22482.5 (see carry-over evidence). To capture the prolonged extended lead-time regime and avoid under-ordering, set L explicit=2.5. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from available demand samples, balancing service level vs holding cost while respecting the inferred longer lead time and large in-transit stock.

Period_32 with on-hand=0 and in-transit=384. Historical concludes show repeatedly extended lead-times (many concluded orders with lead_times 2\u20133, recent average \u22482.5), so use observed lead-time average rather than promised. Use L='calculate' to let backend compute average observed lead time from concluded orders. Demand forecast: use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples \u2014 conservative given regime uncertainty and long history. Large in-transit (384) should provide coverage through the extended lead-time; default mu/sigma allow OR engine to balance service vs holding with current profit/holding cost.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33: demand context shows historically high, volatile weekly demand; current on-hand=0, in-transit=387. Concluded arrivals across many periods consistently show actual lead times of 2\u20133 periods with recent average \u22482.5 and multiple delayed shipments earlier, so I explicitly set L to 2.5 to reflect the extended regime. I leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all historical demand samples, letting it balance service level vs holding cost given the longer effective lead time and large pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime remains extended: concluded lead_times repeatedly 2\u20133 periods, recent average \u22482.5; treat actual L\u22482.5 until conclude messages show reversion. Large persistent in-transit volume (387) noted.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34: on-hand=0, in-transit=387. Historical concluded lead_times repeatedly 2\u20133 periods (multiple concluded orders P1\u2013P?); recent average \u22482.5. Demand samples = [112,97,116,138,94], mean\u2248111.4. Because many shipments have been delayed or extended consistently, set L explicitly to 2.5 to reflect extended lead-time. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, which scales forecasts/uncertainty to the extended lead time and balances service level vs holding cost given high in-transit volume.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime sustained: actual lead times repeatedly 2\u20133 periods; recent average \u22482.5 (evidence: multiple concluded orders across history showing lead_times 2 or 3).

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_35: on-hand=0, in-transit=387; concluded arrivals across history show repeated lead_times of 2\u20133 periods with recent average \u22482.5 and large persistent pipeline. Treat actual lead time as extended to 2.5 to avoid under-ordering against the large in-transit/backlog. Use mu_hat and sigma_hat defaults so backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std based on all samples given the lack of a clear demand regime shift; this balances service level vs holding cost given profit=2 and holding=1.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime sustained: concluded lead_times repeatedly 2\u20133 periods, recent average \u22482.5; large persistent in-transit volume (387) \u2014 treat actual L\u22482.5 until concludes show reversion.

Set L explicitly to 2.5 to force OR engine to plan across the longer realized pipeline; keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all demand samples (stable demand history [112,97,116,138,94]).

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37. Recent history shows a sustained extended lead-time regime (many concluded orders with lead_times mostly 2\u20133, recent average \u22482.5) and large in-transit volume (384) with on-hand=0. Reconcile: pipeline (~384) roughly matches the (1+L)-period demand requirement given mean demand \u2248111/unit; I therefore infer actual L from concluded history rather than using the promised value and let the OR backend compute demand coverage using that L. Chosen methods: L by 'calculate' to capture the empirically observed extended lead time; mu_hat and sigma_hat set to 'default' so the backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples, which balances service level (given elevated L) against holding cost while leveraging the full demand history. Monitor upcoming conclude messages for any reversion of lead-time; if concludes show reversion, switch to recent_N or default L accordingly.

Historical concluded lead_times show consistent 2\u20133 period arrivals (recent average \u22482.5) and many delayed shipments; therefore explicitly set L to 2.5 to reflect the extended lead-time regime. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples (samples=[112,97,116,138,94]) \u2014 this keeps demand forecasting grounded in full history while the explicit L inflates the replenishment horizon to cover the observed prolonged pipeline and reduce stockouts given persistent in-transit volume.

Large persistent in-transit volume suggests shipments are flowing but slower than promised. I set L explicit=2.5 to reflect the sustained extended lead-time regime so the OR backend plans for a longer pipeline. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so backend computes demand across review+lead using all samples (stability of demand mean/variance across history supports using full-sample estimates). This balances service (higher base stock because of longer L) against holding costs given profit=2 vs holding=1.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime sustained: observed concluded lead_times repeatedly 2\u20133 periods, recent average \u22482.5 (evidence: many concluded orders P1\u2013P37 with lead_times 2 or 3); treat actual L\u22482.5 until conclude messages show reversion.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_40: sustained extended lead-time regime observed\u2014concluded orders repeatedly show lead_times of 2\u20133 periods (recent average \u22482.5) and large persistent in-transit (384). Given persistent delays and concluded-history consistency, I set lead-time explicit to 2.5 to have OR engine target pipeline covering (1+L) periods of demand. Demand history (samples mean \u2248111.4) is stable; I use default aggregation for mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using L=2.5. This increases target base-stock to protect service level against delayed arrivals while keeping volatility-driven safety stock from std.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime sustained: concluded lead_times repeatedly 2\u20133 periods, recent average \u22482.5; large persistent in-transit (384). Treat actual L\u22482.5 until concludes indicate reversion.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41: on-hand=0, in-transit=384. Historical concluded lead_times repeatedly 2\u20133 periods with recent average \u22482.5 (many concluded orders P1\u2013P37+). Several earlier prolonged in-transit spells and concluded arrivals confirm extended lead-time regime. To reflect observed reality and protect service level, set L explicitly to 2.5. Use default demand aggregation so backend computes mu_hat=(1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples), letting OR engine balance profit vs holding cost given the explicit lead time estimate.

Carry-over insight: Sustained extended lead-time regime: concluded lead_times repeatedly 2\u20133 periods, recent average \u22482.5; large persistent in-transit volume (~384) \u2014 treat actual L\u22482.5 until conclude messages show reversion.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42. Recent concluded history shows a sustained extended lead-time regime with concluded lead_times repeatedly 2\u20133 periods (recent average \u22482.5) and a large persistent in-transit volume (384). On-hand=0, in-transit=384 \u2014 substantial pipeline exists but arrivals are delayed. To hedge against the empirically longer lead time while letting the OR engine compute demand across review+lead, set L explicitly to 2.5 (captures observed regime). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this leverages full demand history while the explicit L corrects for prolonged lead times. This balances service (longer L \u2192 larger base stock) against holding cost given large existing pipeline and uncertain arrivals.

Period_43: on-hand=0, in-transit=384; historical concluded lead_times repeatedly 2\u20133 periods with recent average \u22482.5 and many delayed arrivals/lost-shipment signals. I therefore set L explicitly to 2.5 to reflect the sustained extended lead-time regime. mu_hat and sigma_hat use default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, letting the OR engine size base-stock against the adjusted review+lead horizon while capping orders. This balances higher safety stock for longer effective lead time against holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Past concludes show many orders arriving at 2\u20133 periods (evidence in history P1\u2013P37+). Given prolonged delayed/lost shipments and stable demand samples (past demands [112,97,116,138,94]), I set lead time explicitly to 2.5 to reflect the sustained extended regime. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this leverages full demand history while the explicit L captures the longer effective pipeline delay, helping the optimizer balance higher pipeline needs against holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Period_45: on-hand=0, in-transit=384 with long history of concluded lead_times ~2\u20133 (recent avg \u22482.5) and large persistent pipeline. Many prior promised-2 shipments arrived after 2\u20133 periods, so treat actual L>promised. I set L explicit=2.5 to reflect the sustained extended lead-time regime; mu_hat and sigma_hat set to default so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from demand samples, letting it scale safety stock to the longer effective lead time. This preserves service by increasing base_stock for longer pipeline while avoiding arbitrary manual demand adjustments; large in-transit volume noted should cover some upcoming demand but delayed arrivals justify higher mu_hat via default scaling.

LLM Rationale:
Period_46: recent concluded history shows sustained extended lead-times (~2\u20133 periods, recent average \u22482.5). On-hand=0, in-transit=384 (large pipeline). Given persistent 2\u20133 period arrivals and large pipeline, set L explicit=2.5 to capture the extended lead-time regime. Use mu_hat default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) \u2014 this scales forecast with the chosen L and the available demand samples. Use sigma_hat default so backend scales variability by sqrt(1+L). These choices let the OR engine raise the base-stock to cover the longer effective pipeline while keeping volatility treatment consistent, reducing stockouts from delayed arrivals while controlling excess holding via the capped order logic.

Period_47: on-hand=0, in-transit=384. Historical concluded lead_times repeatedly 2\u20133 periods (recent average \u22482.5) with many delayed arrivals and large persistent pipeline \u2014 evidence supports treating actual lead time as longer than promised. Use 'calculate' for L so backend averages observed lead times from concluded orders. Demand samples are limited in the environment snapshot; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) so the OR engine applies base-stock scaling consistently while L reflects extended lead-time. This balances higher safety stock (due to longer L) against holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Carry-over insight: Sustained extended lead-time regime: concluded lead_times repeatedly 2\u20133 periods, recent average \u22482.5; large persistent in-transit volume (~384). Treat actual L>promised until conclude messages show reversion.
