Day 1 LLM¡úOR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
On Day 1, we have limited information about actual lead times, so we will use the supplier-promised lead time for L. The demand history shows some variability, so we will use the default method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the overall demand pattern. This approach will help us establish a baseline for future adjustments as more data becomes available.

Daily Profit: $182.00, Daily Holding Cost: $11.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $171.00

Day 2 LLM¡úOR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
On Day 1, the actual lead time for chips(Regular) was 0 days, matching the supplier-promised lead time. The demand for chips(Regular) was 91 units, which is within the range of historical demands. Given the stable lead time and the absence of any news events affecting demand, we will use the 'default' method for L. For mu_hat, since we only have one day of demand data, we will use the 'default' method to account for all historical demand data. Similarly, for sigma_hat, we will use the 'default' method to capture the variability in demand based on historical data.

Daily Profit: $204.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $204.00

Day 3 LLM¡úOR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The actual lead time for chips(Regular) has consistently been 0 days, matching the supplier-promised lead time. Given the high demand on Day 2, which exceeded the historical average, it is prudent to adjust our demand forecast to account for potential spikes. The recent demand pattern suggests a possible trend change, so using recent demand data will help us react more quickly. The standard deviation should also reflect recent variability to ensure we are prepared for fluctuations.

Daily Profit: $432.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $432.00

Day 4 LLM¡úOR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The lead time for chips(Regular) has consistently been 0 days based on the arrival records from Days 1 to 3. Therefore, we will use the 'calculate' method for L, which confirms the supplier-promised lead time. The demand has been highly variable, with a significant increase on Days 2 and 3. To capture this recent trend, we will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, as it will provide a more responsive estimate to the recent surge in demand. This approach will help us better align our orders with the current demand pattern.

Daily Profit: $504.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $504.00

Day 5 LLM¡úOR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical data shows that the actual lead time has consistently been 0 days, matching the supplier-promised lead time. Demand has been increasing significantly each day, suggesting a strong upward trend. Given this trend, it is prudent to use recent demand data to estimate future demand. Since the lead time is 0 days, the expected demand over the lead time period is simply the expected daily demand. To capture the recent trend, I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, as the last three days show a clear pattern of increasing demand.

======================================================================

Daily Reward (R_t): $734.00

Day 6 LLM¡úOR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical data shows that the actual lead time has consistently been 0 days, matching the supplier-promised lead time. Therefore, we will use the 'default' method for L. The demand has been increasing significantly over the past few days, indicating a strong upward trend. To capture this trend, we will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat, focusing on the most recent 5 days to better predict the demand during the lead time period.

Day 7 LLM¡úOR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical data shows that the actual lead time for chips(Regular) has consistently been 0 days, matching the supplier-promised lead time. Therefore, we will use the 'default' method for L. The demand has been increasing significantly over the past days, indicating a trend. To capture this trend, we will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat, focusing on the most recent 5 days to better predict the demand and its variability. This approach will help us react to the increasing demand trend effectively.

Daily Profit: $920.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $920.00

Day 8 LLM¡úOR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical data shows a consistent pattern of high demand for chips(Regular), with demand increasing each day. The lead time has consistently been 0 days, as all orders have arrived on the same day they were placed. Given the increasing trend in demand, it is prudent to use recent demand data to predict future demand. Therefore, I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat, focusing on the most recent 5 days to capture the trend. The lead time will be set to 'calculate' based on observed data, which is 0 days.

Day 17 LLM¡úOR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been consistently increasing over the past days, indicating a strong upward trend. The lead time has consistently been 0 days, as observed from the arrival records. Given the increasing trend in demand, it is prudent to use a method that captures recent demand patterns more accurately. Therefore, for mu_hat, I will use the 'recent_N' method with a focus on the last 5 days to capture the recent surge in demand. For sigma_hat, I will also use the 'recent_N' method to reflect the variability in recent demand. The critical fractile calculation will help determine the optimal order quantity to maximize profit while minimizing holding costs.

Day 18 LLM¡úOR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been consistently increasing, indicating a strong upward trend. The lead time has consistently been 0 days, so we will use the 'default' method for L. Given the increasing trend, we will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand pattern. We will use the last 5 days to calculate these values, as they reflect the most current trend.

Day 21 LLM¡úOR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been consistently increasing over the past 20 days, with no inventory left at the end of each day, indicating a strong upward trend. The lead time has consistently been 0 days, as all orders have arrived on the same day they were placed. Given the increasing trend in demand, it is prudent to use recent demand data to estimate future demand. Therefore, I will use the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, focusing on the last 5 days to capture the recent trend. The lead time will be set to 0 days as observed.

LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been consistently increasing, as seen from the historical data. The lead time has consistently been 0 days, so we will use the 'default' method for L. Given the increasing trend in demand, it is prudent to use a method that captures recent demand patterns. Therefore, for mu_hat, we will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the most recent demand trend. For sigma_hat, we will also use 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect the recent variability in demand.

Day 29 LLM¡úOR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical data shows a consistent pattern of increasing demand for chips(Regular) with a lead time of 0 days as observed from all past arrivals. The demand has been steadily increasing, indicating a trend. Given the current on-hand inventory of 50 units and no in-transit inventory, we need to ensure we have enough stock to meet the expected demand. To capture the recent trend in demand, I will use the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, focusing on the last 5 days to reflect the most recent demand pattern.

Day 34 LLM¡úOR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical data shows a consistent pattern of increasing demand for chips(Regular) with no lead time variability, as all orders have arrived on the same day they were placed. Given the consistent lead time of 0 days, we will use the 'default' method for L. The demand has been steadily increasing, so to capture the most recent trend, we will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with a focus on the last 5 days. For sigma_hat, we will also use the 'recent_N' method to reflect the recent variability in demand, again focusing on the last 5 days.

Day 38 LLM¡úOR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been consistently increasing, as seen from the historical data. The lead time has consistently been 0 days, so we will use the 'default' method for L. Given the increasing trend in demand, it is prudent to use a method that captures recent demand patterns. Therefore, for mu_hat, we will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the most recent demand trend. For sigma_hat, we will also use 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect the recent variability in demand.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been consistently increasing over the past days, with no deviation from the supplier-promised lead time of 0 days. Given the trend of increasing demand, it is prudent to use recent demand data to predict future demand. Since the lead time is consistently 0 days, we will use the 'default' method for L. For mu_hat, we will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the recent trend in demand. For sigma_hat, we will also use 'recent_N' with N=5 to account for the variability in recent demand.

Day 43 LLM¡úOR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical data shows a consistent pattern of increasing demand for chips(Regular) with a lead time of 0 days as observed from all past arrivals. The current on-hand inventory is 182 units with no in-transit inventory. Given the recent demand trends, it is crucial to adjust the expected demand and its variability to reflect the most recent data. Therefore, I will use the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the latest demand trend. I will use the last 5 days to calculate these parameters as they reflect the most recent demand pattern.

Daily Reward (R_t): $7601.00

Day 44 LLM¡úOR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical data shows a consistent lead time of 0 days for all orders, so we will use the 'default' method for L. The demand has been increasing steadily, but the last few days show a slight decrease in demand. To capture this recent trend, we will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat, focusing on the last 5 days to adjust for the recent decrease in demand. This approach will help us avoid overstocking given the current high inventory levels.

Day 50 LLM¡úOR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical data shows a consistent pattern of increasing demand for chips(Regular) with a lead time of 0 days for all orders. Given that today is the last day (Day 50), there is no need to place any further orders. However, for the sake of parameter setting, we will assume a hypothetical scenario where we need to plan for future days. The demand has been increasing steadily, so using recent data will better capture the trend. The lead time remains 0 days as observed. For mu_hat, using the recent 5 days will capture the latest demand trend. For sigma_hat, using the recent 5 days will also capture the variability in the latest demand trend.
