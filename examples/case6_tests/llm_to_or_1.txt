Day 1 LLM¡úOR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
On Day 1, we have limited information about actual lead times and no news events affecting demand. The historical demand data shows variability, but no clear trend or seasonality. Therefore, we will use the default methods for lead time and demand estimates. This approach is suitable for stable conditions and allows us to adjust as more data becomes available.

Daily Profit: $10.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $10.00

Day 2 LLM¡úOR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
On Day 1, the demand for chips(Regular) was 108 units, but only 5 units were available and sold, leaving a significant unmet demand. The in-transit inventory of 477 units suggests a large order was placed, likely to cover anticipated high demand. The supplier-promised lead time is 4 days, but we have no arrival data yet to infer actual lead time. Given the high demand and zero on-hand inventory, it's crucial to ensure future orders are well-calibrated. For L, we will use the 'default' method as we have no actual lead time data yet. For mu_hat, considering the high demand on Day 1 and the historical demand pattern, we will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture recent demand trends. For sigma_hat, we will also use 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect recent variability in demand.

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Day 3 LLM¡úOR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For chips(Regular), we have observed that the actual lead time is not yet available as no orders have arrived. Therefore, we will use the supplier-promised lead time of 4 days. The demand has been volatile, with high demand on Day 1 and lower on Day 2. Given the lack of arrival data, we will use the default method for mu_hat and sigma_hat, which considers the mean and standard deviation of all historical samples. This approach is suitable as we have no strong evidence of a trend or news impact that would necessitate a different method.

======================================================================

Day 3 Demand: {
  "action": {
    "chips(Regular)": 119
  }
}

=== Day 3 Summary ===
chips(Regular): ordered=0, arrived=16 units (ordered on Day 2, lead_time was 1 days), starting on-hand inventory=16, demand=119, sold=16, ending on-hand inventory=0
Daily Profit: $32.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $32.00

Day 4 LLM¡úOR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current situation shows that the actual lead time for the last order was 1 day, which is significantly shorter than the supplier-promised lead time of 4 days. Given this discrepancy, it is prudent to use the 'calculate' method for lead time based on observed data. The demand has been volatile, with a high demand of 119 units on Day 3. To capture recent demand trends, I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat, focusing on the last 3 days to reflect the most current demand pattern.

Daily Profit: $248.00, Daily Holding Cost: $353.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $-105.00

Day 5 LLM¡úOR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For chips(Regular), we have observed lead times of 1 and 3 days from past arrivals. The average lead time is (1+3)/2 = 2 days, which is shorter than the supplier-promised lead time of 4 days. Therefore, we will use the calculated average lead time. The demand has been fluctuating, with recent demands being higher than the earlier ones. To capture this trend, we will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat, focusing on the last 5 days to better reflect the current demand pattern. This approach will help us react to recent changes in demand more effectively.

Daily Profit: $102.00, Daily Holding Cost: $302.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $-200.00

Day 6 LLM¡úOR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For chips(Regular), we have observed lead times of 1 day and 3 days from past arrivals. The average lead time is (1+3)/2 = 2 days, which is shorter than the supplier-promised lead time of 4 days. Given the current high inventory levels (302 on-hand and 215 in-transit), we should be cautious with ordering. The demand has been fluctuating, with a recent drop on Day 5. To capture recent demand trends, we will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5, as it will help us react to the latest demand changes. This approach balances the need to be responsive to recent demand while considering the variability in demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-101.00

Day 7 LLM¡úOR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For chips(Regular), we have observed lead times of 1 and 3 days from past arrivals. The average lead time is (1+3)/2 = 2 days. The current on-hand inventory is 235 units, and there are 215 units in transit. The demand has been fluctuating, with a recent decrease in demand. To capture recent trends, we will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5, as the last 5 days show a more stable pattern. This will help us react to any recent changes in demand patterns.

Daily Profit: $206.00, Daily Holding Cost: $347.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $-141.00

Day 8 LLM¡úOR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For chips(Regular), the actual lead times observed are 1 day and 3 days. The average of these lead times is 2 days, which is shorter than the supplier-promised lead time of 4 days. Given the current inventory of 347 units and no units in transit, we have a buffer to accommodate demand fluctuations. The demand pattern shows variability, with recent demands being lower than earlier ones. To capture recent trends, I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat, focusing on the last 5 days. This approach will help us react to any recent changes in demand patterns.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-71.00

Day 9 LLM¡úOR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For chips(Regular), the actual lead times observed are 1 day and 3 days. The average of these lead times is 2 days, which is shorter than the supplier-promised lead time of 4 days. Given the stable demand pattern and no news events affecting demand, we will use the calculated average lead time. For mu_hat, we will use the 'default' method as the demand pattern does not show significant recent changes, and the historical average should provide a reliable estimate. For sigma_hat, we will also use the 'default' method to capture the variability in demand over the lead time period.

Daily Profit: $200.00, Daily Holding Cost: $155.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $45.00

Day 10 LLM¡úOR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For chips(Regular), the actual lead times observed are 1 day (Day 3) and 3 days (Days 4 and 7). The average lead time is (1 + 3 + 3) / 3 = 2.33 days, which we will round to 2 days for simplicity. The demand has been fluctuating, but there is no clear trend, so we will use the default method for mu_hat and sigma_hat, which considers all historical data. The current on-hand inventory is 155 units, and there are 47 units in transit, which should be considered in the pipeline inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $82.00

Day 11 LLM¡úOR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For chips(Regular), the actual lead times observed are 1 day and 3 days. The average of these lead times is 2 days, which is shorter than the supplier-promised lead time of 4 days. Given the current on-hand inventory of 76 units and in-transit inventory of 140 units, we have a total pipeline inventory of 216 units. The demand pattern shows some variability, with recent demands being lower than earlier ones. To capture recent trends, I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat, focusing on the last 5 days. This approach will help us react to the recent decrease in demand while considering the variability.

Daily Profit: $244.00, Daily Holding Cost: $47.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $197.00

Day 12 LLM¡úOR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For chips(Regular), the actual lead times observed are 1 day (twice) and 3 days (twice). The average lead time is (1+1+3+3)/4 = 2 days. Given the variability in lead times, using the calculated average provides a balanced approach. The demand has been fluctuating, with recent demands being relatively high. To capture recent trends, I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5, as the last 5 days show a higher average demand compared to the overall historical data. This approach will help in adjusting to recent demand patterns.

Daily Profit: $188.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $188.00

Day 13 LLM¡úOR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For chips(Regular), we have observed lead times of 1 day (twice) and 3 days (three times). The average lead time is (1+1+3+3+3)/5 = 2.2 days, which we will round to 2 days for simplicity. The demand has been fluctuating, but there is no clear trend of increase or decrease. Given the variability in demand, we will use the 'default' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the overall demand pattern. The current on-hand inventory is 0, and there are 276 units in transit, so we need to ensure we have enough stock to meet demand once the in-transit units arrive.

Day 14 LLM¡úOR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For chips(Regular), the actual lead times observed are 1, 3, 3, 1, and 3 days. The average lead time is 2.2 days, which suggests using the 'calculate' method for L. The demand pattern shows variability, with recent demands being 122, 119, and 102. To capture recent trends, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this will provide a more responsive estimate to recent demand changes. The recent demands are [79, 122, 119, 102], which will be used to calculate the mean and standard deviation.

Day 15 LLM¡úOR Decision:
======================================================================

For chips(Regular), the actual lead times observed are 1 day (twice) and 3 days (three times). The average lead time is (1+1+3+3+3)/5 = 2.2 days, which we will round to 2 days for simplicity. The demand has been fluctuating, with recent days showing higher demand. To capture this trend, we will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat, focusing on the last 5 days. This will help us react to the recent increase in demand. The critical fractile is 2/(2+1) = 0.67, which will be used by the OR algorithm to compute the optimal order quantity.

Day 16 LLM¡úOR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For chips(Regular), the actual lead times observed are 1 day (twice) and 3 days (twice). The average lead time is (1+1+3+3)/4 = 2 days. Given the variability in lead times, using the calculated average is more reliable than the supplier-promised lead time. The demand has been fluctuating, with recent days showing higher demand. To capture this trend, I will use the recent_N method for mu_hat and sigma_hat, focusing on the last 5 days to reflect the recent increase in demand. This approach will help us react to the current demand pattern more effectively.

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Day 17 LLM¡úOR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current situation shows that the on-hand inventory is zero, and there are 377 units in transit. The historical demand data indicates a high variability in demand, with recent days showing a trend of unmet demand due to stockouts. The actual lead times observed are 1 and 3 days, with a majority being 3 days. Given this, I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time to reflect the average observed lead time. For mu_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the recent trend of higher demand. For sigma_hat, I will also use 'recent_N' with N=5 to account for the recent variability in demand.

Day 18 LLM¡úOR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For chips(Regular), the actual lead times observed are 1, 3, 3, 1, 3, and 3 days. The average lead time is approximately 2.33 days, but given the variability and the fact that the most common lead time is 3 days, we will use the 'calculate' method for L. The demand has been fluctuating, with recent demands being higher than earlier ones. To capture this trend, we will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat, focusing on the last 5 days to reflect the recent demand pattern. This approach will help us react to the recent increase in demand and adjust our inventory accordingly.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4.00

Day 19 LLM¡úOR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For chips(Regular), the actual lead times observed are 1 day (twice) and 3 days (four times). The average lead time is (1+1+3+3+3+3)/6 = 2.67 days, which we round to 3 days for simplicity. The demand has been fluctuating, but there is no clear trend, so we will use the default method for mu_hat and sigma_hat, which considers all historical data. This approach balances the need to react to demand variability while accounting for the average lead time.

Day 20 LLM¡úOR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For chips(Regular), the actual lead times observed are 1, 3, 3, 3, 1, 3, 3, and 6 days. The average lead time is approximately 2.875 days, which suggests using a calculated lead time of 3 days. The demand has been fluctuating, with recent demands being higher than earlier ones. To capture this trend, we use the recent_N method for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5, focusing on the most recent demand data. This approach will help us react to the recent increase in demand and adjust our inventory accordingly.

Day 21 LLM¡úOR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For chips(Regular), we have observed lead times of 1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 6, and 4 days. The average lead time is approximately 3.29 days, which suggests using a calculated lead time of 3 days for simplicity and stability. The demand has been fluctuating, with recent demands being relatively high. To capture recent trends, we will use the mean of the last 5 days for mu_hat. The standard deviation will also be based on the last 5 days to reflect recent variability.

LLM Rationale:
For chips(Regular), the historical lead times observed are 1, 3, 3, 1, 3, 3, 3, 6, 4 days. The average lead time is approximately 3.22 days, which suggests using the 'calculate' method for L. The demand has been fluctuating, but recent demands have been relatively high. To capture recent trends, we use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat, focusing on the last 5 days of demand data: [122, 119, 102, 128, 112]. This approach will help us react to recent demand patterns and adjust our inventory accordingly.

Day 23 LLM¡úOR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For chips(Regular), the actual lead times observed are 1, 3, 3, 1, 3, 3, 6, 4 days. The average of these lead times is approximately 3.0 days, which is consistent with the supplier-promised lead time of 4 days. Given the variability in lead times, using the calculated average provides a more accurate estimate. The demand has been fluctuating, with recent demands showing a slight decrease. To capture recent trends, I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5, as it will better reflect the current demand pattern. This approach will help in adjusting the order quantities to avoid overstocking while meeting demand.

Day 24 LLM¡úOR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For chips(Regular), the historical lead times observed are 1, 3, 3, 1, 3, 3, 6, 3, 4, and 2 days. The average lead time is approximately 2.9 days, so we will use the 'calculate' method for L. The demand has been fluctuating, with recent demands being higher than earlier ones. To capture this trend, we will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat, focusing on the most recent demand data to better predict future demand. This approach will help us react to the recent increase in demand and adjust our inventory accordingly.

For chips(Regular), the historical lead times observed are 1, 3, 3, 1, 3, 3, 6, 4, 2 days. The average lead time is approximately 3 days, which is consistent with the supplier-promised lead time. Therefore, we will use the 'calculate' method for L. The demand has been fluctuating, but there is no clear trend, so we will use the 'default' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat, which considers all historical data. This approach balances the need to react to demand variability while maintaining a stable inventory strategy.

Day 26 LLM¡úOR Decision:

For chips(Regular), the historical lead times observed are 1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 6, 4, and 2 days. The average lead time is approximately 3.125 days, which is close to the supplier-promised lead time of 4 days. Given the variability in lead times, using the calculated average is more reflective of actual conditions. The demand has been fluctuating, with recent demands showing a slight decrease. To capture recent trends, I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5, as it will provide a more responsive estimate to recent demand changes. This approach will help in adjusting orders to avoid overstocking while meeting demand.

The average of these lead times is approximately 3.125 days, which suggests using a lead time of 3 days for calculations. The demand has been fluctuating, but recent demands have been lower than the earlier days. To capture recent trends, I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This will help in adjusting to the recent lower demand pattern. The critical fractile is 0.67, which will be used in the OR algorithm to compute the optimal order quantity.

The demand has been fluctuating, but recent demands have been relatively high. To capture recent trends, I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5, as the last five demands are [113, 109, 110, 109, 110].

The average of these lead times is approximately 2.75 days, which we will round to 3 days for simplicity. The demand has been quite variable, with recent demands showing a slight increase. Given the variability and the fact that we have 386 units in transit, we should use recent demand data to better capture the current trend. Therefore, we will use the last 5 days of demand data to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This approach will help us react to recent changes in demand patterns.

Day 33 LLM¡úOR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For chips(Regular), we need to determine the lead time, expected demand, and demand variability to optimize our order quantity. The historical lead times observed are 1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 6, 4, 2, and 3 days. The most frequent lead time is 3 days, so we will use this as our calculated lead time. The demand has been fluctuating, with recent demands showing a slight increase. To capture this trend, we will use the recent 5 days' demand to calculate the expected demand over the lead time period. For demand variability, we will also use the recent 5 days to capture the current variability in demand.

Day 34 LLM¡úOR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For chips(Regular), the historical lead times have varied, with most recent lead times being 3 days. Given the variability, I will use the 'calculate' method to average the observed lead times. The demand has been fluctuating, with recent demands showing a slight increase. To capture this trend, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat, focusing on the most recent demand data to better predict future demand during the lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $30.00

Day 35 LLM¡úOR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For chips(Regular), the historical lead times observed are 1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3 days. The average lead time is approximately 2.8 days, so we will use the 'calculate' method for L. The demand has been fluctuating, but recent demands have been slightly lower than the earlier days. To capture recent trends, we will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5, as the last 5 days show a more consistent pattern of demand around 90-110 units. This will help us react to the recent demand pattern more effectively.

For chips(Regular), the historical lead times observed are 1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 6, 4, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2 days. The most frequent lead time is 3 days, so we will use this as the calculated lead time. The demand has been fluctuating, but there is no clear trend of increase or decrease, so we will use the default method for mu_hat and sigma_hat, which considers all historical data. This approach balances the need to react to demand variability while maintaining a stable inventory level.

For chips(Regular), the historical lead times observed are 1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 6, 4, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2 days. The most frequent lead time is 3 days, so we will use this as the calculated lead time. The demand has been fluctuating, but there is no clear upward or downward trend, so we will use the default method for mu_hat and sigma_hat, which considers all historical data.

Daily Reward (R_t): $44.00

Day 39 LLM¡úOR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For chips(Regular), the historical data shows a fluctuating demand pattern with some high peaks. The actual lead times observed are mostly around 3 days, with occasional deviations. Given the current in-transit inventory of 371 units and no on-hand inventory, it's crucial to accurately predict demand to avoid stockouts or excessive holding costs. The recent demand has been relatively high, so we should consider recent trends. Therefore, for L, we use the 'calculate' method based on observed lead times. For mu_hat, we use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the recent demand trend. For sigma_hat, we also use 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect recent demand variability.

Day 40 LLM¡úOR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For chips(Regular), the historical lead times observed are 1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 6, 4, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2. The average lead time is approximately 3.25 days, which is close to the supplier-promised lead time of 4 days. Given the variability in lead times, using the calculated average provides a more accurate estimate. The demand has been fluctuating, with recent demands showing a slight increase. To capture this trend, I will use the recent_N method for mu_hat and sigma_hat, focusing on the last 10 days to reflect recent demand patterns. This approach will help in adjusting to any recent changes in demand while considering the variability.

For chips(Regular), we have observed lead times of 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 5, and 6 days. The most frequent lead time is 3 days, but there is variability, so we will use the average of observed lead times for L. The historical demand data shows some variability, with recent demands being slightly higher. To capture recent trends, we will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat, focusing on the last 10 days to account for recent demand patterns.

LLM Rationale:
For chips(Regular), the historical lead times observed are 1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 6, 4, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2, 5, and 4 days. The average of these lead times is approximately 3.36 days. Given the variability in lead times, using the calculated average provides a more accurate estimate than the supplier-promised lead time. The demand has been relatively stable with some fluctuations, so using recent demand data will help capture any recent trends. For mu_hat, using the recent 5 days of demand data will help adjust for any recent changes in demand patterns. For sigma_hat, using the recent 5 days will also help capture the variability in the most recent demand data.

For chips(Regular), we have observed lead times of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 days. The most frequent lead time is 3 days, which aligns with the supplier-promised lead time. Therefore, we will use the 'calculate' method to average the observed lead times.

Day 45 LLM¡úOR Decision:
======================================================================

For chips(Regular), we need to determine the optimal parameters for ordering given the current situation. The historical lead times observed are 1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 5, 4, 3, 3, 3, 2, 5, 4, 3. The average of these lead times is approximately 3.15 days, so we will use a lead time of 3 days for our calculations. The demand has been fluctuating, but there is no clear trend of increase or decrease, so we will use the recent 10 days to calculate the expected demand and standard deviation to capture any recent changes in demand patterns. This approach will help us react to any recent changes in demand while considering the variability in demand.

The demand has been fluctuating, with recent demands showing a slight increase. To capture recent trends, we will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5, as the last 5 days show a demand pattern that may be more indicative of current conditions.

The average lead time is approximately 2.65 days, so we will use the 'calculate' method for L. The demand has been relatively stable with some fluctuations, so we will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture recent trends.

For chips(Regular), we have observed lead times of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 days. The most frequent lead time is 3 days, but recent orders have been arriving in 1 day. Given the variability, we'll use the average of observed lead times for L. The demand has been fluctuating, but there is no clear trend, so we'll use the default method for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the overall demand pattern. The current on-hand inventory is 153 units, and there are 150 units in transit, which should cover immediate demand, but we need to plan for future demand considering the lead time.

chips(Regular): ordered=98, arrived=0, starting on-hand inventory=153, demand=117, sold=117, ending on-hand inventory=36
Daily Profit: $234.00, Daily Holding Cost: $36.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $198.00

Day 50 LLM¡úOR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For chips(Regular), we have observed lead times of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 days. The most frequent lead time is 3 days, but recent orders have shown a lead time of 1 day. Given the variability, I will use the 'calculate' method to average the observed lead times, which is approximately 3 days. For mu_hat, I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 to capture the most recent demand trend, as demand has been fluctuating. For sigma_hat, I will also use 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect recent variability in demand.

======================================================================

chips(Regular):
  L method: calculate, computed L = 2.82
  mu_hat method: recent_N, computed mu_hat = 422.35
  sigma_hat method: recent_N, computed sigma_hat = 16.38
  Total inventory (on-hand + in-transit): 284
  Critical fractile q = 0.6667, z* = 0.4307
  Base stock = 429.41
  Computed order: 146

======================================================================
Final Order Action:
{
  "action": {
    "chips(Regular)": 146
  }
}
======================================================================

Day 50 Demand: {
  "action": {
    "chips(Regular)": 102
  }
}

=== Day 50 Summary ===
chips(Regular): ordered=146, arrived=130 units (ordered on Day 48, lead_time was 2 days), starting on-hand inventory=166, demand=102, sold=102, ending on-hand inventory=64
Daily Profit: $204.00, Daily Holding Cost: $64.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $140.00
